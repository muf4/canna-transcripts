would do it and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was always in sports and shit and I Just
never quite got into it all my buddies
[SPEAKER_05]: were just really down for it constantly
and Over the course of time like I Started

like they made it seem so fucking fun and
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody's partying all the time Well,
then one day my buddies going and fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking a bowl and I see some seeds They
pulled out of the bud and I was like so
[SPEAKER_05]: those things they just grow like you just
plant those things like oh, yeah,

fucking nice railroad tie box and did all
[SPEAKER_05]: this shit like that and Fucking all this
compost my parents grew up like gardening

there is like this kind of origin for me,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I go and plant these fucking Seeds I
get a bunch of them to come up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think ended up being six or so I End up
going and growing them out every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd go back there.

[SPEAKER_05]: anything about flowering it's I'm just
like, okay Well, this does not look like
[SPEAKER_05]: what my buddy has in a bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it'll turn brown eventually and I
just fucking eventually just Decided in
[SPEAKER_05]: the fall.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well time to go pull these out chopped
them at the stake and fucking threw them
[SPEAKER_05]: all in this giant fucking hefty bag and
then Threw them in my trunk and went to my
[SPEAKER_05]: buddy's house that gave me the seeds So we
get there and I'm like, hey man,
[SPEAKER_05]: like, uh, are the seeds you gave me?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, yeah, I'm like, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I grew them out I got I got like
some pot or whatever like, do you know
[SPEAKER_05]: what to do with it?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, yeah He's like show me it was
like what you got like an ounce or
[SPEAKER_05]: something I'm like no concept of weight at
the time and just like a few ounces or so
[SPEAKER_05]: and then open on my trunk and it's just a
hefty bag of eight full mature plants and
[SPEAKER_05]: he's like You can't do this So that night
We're sitting there and he's like I like
[SPEAKER_05]: thank you for doing this and all we're
sitting at a picnic table He's like we got
[SPEAKER_05]: to trim it.

[SPEAKER_05]: sitting there and dudes like So like have
you tried it yet?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, no, I've never tried weed and
he's like, oh Well, do you do you want to
[SPEAKER_05]: and from then on like Just grab some weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We threw it in a fucking bowl wet as shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was disgusting fucking burn like
fucking off shit and then Got high right
[SPEAKER_05]: away felt awesome loved it and then we
just started doing it like every day since
[SPEAKER_05]: and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like there's something to come from
that of going and like growing for my
[SPEAKER_05]: buddies that were just spending $20
constantly on like weed and just growing
[SPEAKER_05]: it for them just I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it set me on a different Track
than some other people I guess that
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes get into weed originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I Don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely Definitely a different story
than most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool though that your very
first experience smoking cannabis It was
[SPEAKER_00]: your own shit, you know, even if it was
wet and green and stuff I remember like at
[SPEAKER_05]: the same time like this dude just brought
over this bag of just this nasty brown
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff and he's like well like Where did
that come from?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, oh, I mean Like me I guess he's
like can I have some and then we just
[SPEAKER_05]: started like Giving it away to everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: We never fucking we never sold a bit of it
either That's not what I was in for from
[SPEAKER_05]: the start.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just like right away It was just
like all her buddies there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got four buddies and they're calling
their friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, hey, man There's a garbage
bag of pot that is just open to the masses
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun and I don't know I I think I
was fortunate to go and have that be my
[SPEAKER_05]: like first experience because it just
immediately took off into like oh Like
[SPEAKER_05]: chasing that feeling of making that many
people happy with something like that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like I don't know it's It's a
cool lesson to learn like really early on
[SPEAKER_00]: that's pretty damn cool Really and you
know when we were talking earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: you definitely made a point kind of what
you were just saying about the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between people that grow cannabis for
money and People that are also putting
[SPEAKER_00]: their time into growing other plants and
learning how to grow other plants not just
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that that's gonna really Bring up
your status as a grower and how you
[SPEAKER_00]: understand plants dealing with more than
just cannabis, you know Definitely not in
[SPEAKER_00]: it For the money and in it for the love of
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's pretty awesome that you do
that man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, dude It's it's a sad thing to be
heartless in a fucking like process,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like Who who wants to do
something that they're not willing to like
[SPEAKER_05]: fully dedicate to you know, I mean I'm not
saying like I'll just like fuck everything
[SPEAKER_05]: else like let me just focus on this one
thing no, but it's like I Don't know if
[SPEAKER_05]: you want a garden fucking garden do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well Fucking spend your time do your
research all that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's I Don't know man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't miss yourself do it for the love of
gardening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's like you're you're bestowed
this fucking reason not reason but like
[SPEAKER_05]: Inclination to go and like do and be
interested in this thing like Just fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: chase it man Like it did come out of
nowhere like it's weird like if you got a
[SPEAKER_05]: feeling that You wanted to go do something
fucking do it Just fucking grow I love it
[SPEAKER_00]: I Appreciate that you've came into our
discord server not that you're just doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this with me today But you've been over
there sharing a lot of information as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very cool of you What do you think
of the discord so far?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the most fun so I'm part of like Two

people there are there for it too rather
[SPEAKER_05]: than just like going and snapping at each
other and just making fucking shitty jokes
[SPEAKER_05]: like It's it's a very cool thing that you
started here it's It's fun to be part of
[SPEAKER_05]: it and it's it's cool that people actually
want to learn it's like I don't come
[SPEAKER_05]: across too much of that talking to like
all the commercial dudes I hang out with
[SPEAKER_05]: and like it's just Just a nine-to-five for
them and it's just they at the end of the
[SPEAKER_05]: day They don't want to talk about it and
if they do want to talk about it's boring
[SPEAKER_05]: as shit Where it's like you guys you're
open to like well What part of Africa and
[SPEAKER_05]: why would that part of Africa have a
different leaf type than northern Africa
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's cool like Questions are fun and
it's cool that you guys asked so many Fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean That's something that I really
liked about you Dave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does a lot of really cool old lines
like that that I'm into I appreciate the
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck that you not only do those old lines
But you're also working with other
[SPEAKER_00]: heirlooms from different varieties such as
like peppers and things like this So it's
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a wealth of knowledge even for
people like me that have got into land
[SPEAKER_00]: races, but may have not touched This
different region or this different region.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for something You have that
experience where you can speak on that and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's that's a wealth of information for
somebody like me Even some of the new
[SPEAKER_00]: growers in our chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that's just like, you know If I
had that to begin with that would have
[SPEAKER_00]: been awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you were saying, you know some of
those early form days I'm specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking of I see Meg right now and how
hostile it was I Mean it was a different
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a different day in time,
you know So it's really cool that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that now and that's what I
was trying to create is an Environment
[SPEAKER_00]: that was everything the old form should
have been That I was hoping Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: would have been when I got on it and it
turned into more You know the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: and the bickering and arguing and just I
don't have time for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to learn I'm here to steward the
plant and I want to help people,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Yeah, Instagram's done.
[SPEAKER_05]: It started off pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: But man it has turned into a disservice
almost I feel like yeah fast It's it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: target for especially cannabis growers
Well, it's like a petri dish.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fucking nuts man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you go and have like one Little
asshole go and make a comment and then it
[SPEAKER_05]: just spawns out like a fucking colony.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Insane and then like these people
just get drunk who just make a joke or do
[SPEAKER_05]: something They just fucking get drug
through the mud and then they like fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: people going and throwing fucking like
People's information out there and all
[SPEAKER_05]: this kind of stuff is it just gets wild
real quick and it's just like that's I
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't want to be part of that exactly
Yeah, not only that but Jesus Christ talk
[SPEAKER_05]: about a fucking like one-sided platform of
just like a cookies dispensary it's just
[SPEAKER_05]: like everybody that's all anybody fucking
does and it's just This gelato and this
[SPEAKER_05]: cookie, but it's basically all cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So speaking of which how's your cookies
project turned out?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh God, I got to Miserable they're in the
corner.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're probably gonna be gorgeous and
smell like pie dough and Get thrown in a
[SPEAKER_00]: compost pile You know, I'll say I'll say
I've had Actually went and picked up some
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies earlier today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe it or not.

decent with it's that Gary Payden That
[SPEAKER_00]: one's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's been It's not a long-lasting
High it's definitely not up to par with
[SPEAKER_00]: something special you find out of a land
race like hazy That's gonna blow you out
[SPEAKER_00]: for a couple hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah It's decent out of everything that's
coming out cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one the decent ones I would say and
I've grown a few of them and about the
[SPEAKER_00]: same Results as you just man, you know,
not super stoked about it, but that one's
[SPEAKER_05]: all right It's got a purpose man,
like and like I say this constant it's
[SPEAKER_05]: like just because it's not for me doesn't
mean it's not forever Everybody else
[SPEAKER_05]: exactly that is totally cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have a cookie cut like not it's not
like a cookie cut It's a it's called
[SPEAKER_05]: orange freeze.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a fucking orange cookie crossed with
Sour alien sour apple IBL it is just a
[SPEAKER_05]: selected fino from the local area the
fucking plant rips if you go and smoke it
[SPEAKER_05]: like a month after it's Fucking harvested
it doesn't do a fucking dick to you like
[SPEAKER_05]: No, hi.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember like giving it to my buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We both finished at the same time We both
had and just like it tastes awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, wow, it tastes so good and then
fucking in unison we're like doesn't do a
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking drop of anything and It was just
so disappointing so we both just like
[SPEAKER_05]: shelf the thing and just sat it there for
like probably another month or so and then
[SPEAKER_05]: we go and like crack it and it's really
opening a fucking jar of Chlorine for your
[SPEAKER_05]: pool and it's just like this fucking like
whoa Like this just like it's like
[SPEAKER_05]: somebody dumped a bag of oranges and just
like a high chlorinated water it's just
[SPEAKER_05]: this weird fucking like Orange kind of
sounds good though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's fucking I'll talk so much shit on
cookies, but I have one it's like my
[SPEAKER_05]: favorite thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Is that the one that was showing the
jettation?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, so that was another one for from
another local buddy It was a gelato the
[SPEAKER_05]: gelato cut that they called jello Costs
with the creamsicle for and then I hit it
[SPEAKER_05]: with pollen from a fruity pebbles OG so my
pollen onto his clone and I just wanted to
[SPEAKER_05]: If somebody gives me a cut it's fun to go
and like make something with it and then
[SPEAKER_05]: grow it out and then give them the seeds
and be like this is what you could expect
[SPEAKER_05]: with That thing that you gave me that I
made stuff with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just uh, so I was just kind of like
doing a little side project for him and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's just like It's just miserable It
can't all be winners, I mean Ever expect
[SPEAKER_00]: any breeder any preservation niche to make
fire every single time that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're playing around trying to see what
works But Jesus man like fucking Instagram
[SPEAKER_05]: will go and make you think everybody's
Just fucking nailing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah Trophy wife picture up there Show
me your meds So we talked about your early
[SPEAKER_00]: days in the cannabis and what got you into
smoking cannabis When did it change?
[SPEAKER_00]: When were you like?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna start breeding this I'm gonna
start trying to make some types that are
[SPEAKER_05]: unique to boogie junk Yeah, so I went and
after like the original like me growing
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff It took off pretty quick after that
and it was just one of those things that I
[SPEAKER_05]: was I Slowly like met a whole new group of
friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were all into punk We started going
to just punk shows constantly all these
[SPEAKER_05]: like folk shows like just weird when I say
fuck I'd Yes, lots of bands Sanjos and
[SPEAKER_05]: other odd instruments made in the 1600s
But also these dudes would like just
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking rip and they'd always play with
like these crazy like house punk bands
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not seen much of that outside of
the Midwest But it was just like these
[SPEAKER_05]: boys that would get down But everybody
will always smoke pot and everybody was
[SPEAKER_05]: always like bringing different cuts like
not cuts but like different nugs of
[SPEAKER_05]: different cuts around and that's when I
just started getting interested I was like
[SPEAKER_05]: If I remember like lemon G the first time
and just like somebody like I'm like,
[SPEAKER_05]: what the fuck is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cuz like prior that it's just like a mutt
just smelled like pot to me like Just just
[SPEAKER_05]: nothing like oh, yeah, that's dang But
it's also because I was just constantly
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking like undried fucking just shitty
weed or brick So then I smell lemon G.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, whoa We does that he's like,
yeah, he's like here's this other stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: and he starts like shouting I remember
like there was a G 13 at one point that
[SPEAKER_05]: was just like fucking in just pine bomb
just weird Midwest G 13 thing that we go
[SPEAKER_05]: around it's like kind of like pine piney
cleaner almost not like og but and that's
[SPEAKER_05]: where Hanging around these bands going and
smoking all these different types of
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking weed and just seeing people being
like, oh, yeah, here's like some fresh
[SPEAKER_05]: buds and stuff like that everything at the
time was coming out of like probably
[SPEAKER_05]: Columbus area we'd see him like Everything
that was all around the Midwest like that
[SPEAKER_05]: was really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just seemed like it came out of Columbus
But that's where it just took off and then
[SPEAKER_05]: after that I just started collecting seeds
constantly and that's where I got into
[SPEAKER_05]: names because otherwise I was just like
for the longest time just throwing seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: in a fucking bag and like oh, yeah Here's
my bag of weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no difference and then I started
hearing names.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh So this is four way they're
like, yeah, but it's like Ohio four way
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, yeah, but this one's four way.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, no That's a different four
way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just like a huge learning process
and The more I got into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, oh, this is actually just like
flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this is just like peppers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this is like I grew up like gardening
and doing all these things with my parents
[SPEAKER_05]: and shit so like for some reason I thought
that like Weed was this enigma,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially because like when I first grew
it I was like there's a boy and a girl
[SPEAKER_05]: like everything else is just oh,
yeah, let's fuck So I think that was
[SPEAKER_00]: probably some of the best points of
growing when you don't know anything And
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so much to learn that the world
was exciting, you know And then it it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: to a point where you're like, where do I
go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the next rabbit hole?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool when you find that rabbit hole
But you got to start like searching out
[SPEAKER_00]: for it instead of everything being new,
you know Well, you got to fuck up a ton
[SPEAKER_05]: Constantly and have people tell you you're
fucked like if you're surrounded by yes
[SPEAKER_05]: dudes that are like Yo, dude, this shitty
weed is bomb.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like that's not gonna help anything
like somebody has to come up and be like
[SPEAKER_05]: to this weed sucks and this is why and
it's like Like get your feelings hurt,
[SPEAKER_05]: man Well, you got to fuck up a ton
Constantly and have people tell you you're
[SPEAKER_05]: fucked like if you're surrounded by yes
dudes that are like yo, dude this shit
[SPEAKER_00]: I was I was actually talking to the guys
in the discord about that the other day I
[SPEAKER_00]: was saying it's not that hard to find a
good female it's hard much harder to take
[SPEAKER_00]: good ones and Be able to say okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna fuck off with those Ones cuz
this one is actually a step above that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there's good and then there's
exceptional, you know Yeah That's a yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's sometimes the best ones are the
ugliest ones yeah, I'll have ones that
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just have for like a Couple years and
I never flower on my mic, but maybe The
[SPEAKER_05]: entire time I have like Hundreds of seeds
of that exact thing that there's probably
[SPEAKER_05]: a way better one in but I'm like this one
was cool that one time It was yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried before yeah, so it's just a
magician says I knew Hagrid grew weed So
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't the first time I've heard you
throw out that lemon G with it be Accurate
[SPEAKER_05]: to say that's one of your favorite types
Okay, there is Yes a yes to answer your
[SPEAKER_05]: question But man people either love it or
hate it and it was wild because I remember
[SPEAKER_05]: for the longest time if you've never
smelled or tried lemon G like and you
[SPEAKER_05]: smell it and it's like what in the fuck is
this pot like it's just this gnarly
[SPEAKER_05]: pungent fucking like It's Lemony but it
has that almost like that burn off of
[SPEAKER_05]: Theos like skunk does but it's not skunky
like that It's like skunk money kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: like and that's not doing it justice like
it's a really hard lemon profile to go and
[SPEAKER_05]: explain but it is just like Nostalgia wise
that was like for me the reason why it's
[SPEAKER_05]: one of my favorites is just because it's
the one weed that could just It's the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning Was that one from like exclusive
to your area because like I was talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: you about earlier We saw it quite a bit up
here that lemon G was actually pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: popular in Washington Yeah, as soon as
things took off over in California and
[SPEAKER_05]: well there was a lot of people that went
and migrated over to Colorado for a minute
[SPEAKER_05]: from the Midwest and then lemon G just
circulate around saying with like Indiana
[SPEAKER_05]: bubblegum Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you live anywhere in the Midwest the
you could find probably lemon G the
[SPEAKER_05]: Indiana bubblegum There were several
different g13 cuts Death Star went around
[SPEAKER_05]: some of the states You could just There
was a handful that were just always around
[SPEAKER_05]: Michigan and like fucking dumpster was
around pretty often but Over the course of
[SPEAKER_05]: time as these states opened up and people
got less and less Popular around here They
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of shot over to the West slowly.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a bunch of people that landed
over in Colorado There were a bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: people that landed over in Oregon,
Washington Different parts of California
[SPEAKER_05]: that took these cuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: So lemon G definitely made it over there
at some point.
[SPEAKER_05]: I Heard from like the forums I remember
like specifically like I see Meg like I
[SPEAKER_05]: because I would just go through there cuz
like at the time I just I Could never find
[SPEAKER_05]: the cut or anything like that And I just
didn't know that many grow everybody is so
[SPEAKER_05]: quiet that nobody fucking talked to each
other So nobody knew each other grew and
[SPEAKER_05]: then it's like slowly you find out it's
like I've known you for like eight years
[SPEAKER_05]: and like we both have the same fucking
hobby and they're like, oh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: but like don't tell anyone So Finally get
a hold of like a cut but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington Pretty intense man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize that I had talked to you
back a couple years ago I I was pretty

[SPEAKER_00]: but I appreciate you guys throwing it up
there, too So since we talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes a little bit in the ones that you
do like we're gonna talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about land races now I really want to get
in the land race talk obviously Yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're gonna get into that one because
I need to know a little bit more Because
[SPEAKER_00]: you were very you were open-ended It's
this terpene and it's offending the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: out of me, and I got to know why So as far
as your presence You're really into land
[SPEAKER_00]: races.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you're into sours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're into hazes I know you did that
sangle ease that one with a heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: carotenoids in it that was beautiful plant
by the way Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw you did the Lesotho the Kerala gold
the Ghana Tell me more about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know nothing about the Ghana at all so I
Actually haven't run the Ghana I I have
[SPEAKER_05]: some of them right now but the Ghana are
coming up on the Repopulation list but as
[SPEAKER_05]: far as like a lot of the African the
African varieties The awesome he's got the
[SPEAKER_00]: map right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Ghana is right here by the way Right
in that nice cake it up Right there also
[SPEAKER_05]: this map is from like 1972 so there are a
ton of countries that don't even exist
[SPEAKER_05]: anymore but uh Yeah, the African stuff has
been really fun to go through I I had the
[SPEAKER_05]: fortune right around getting online like
not online, but like Instagram type thing
[SPEAKER_05]: where I Just met this really great
preservationist and we had kind of been
[SPEAKER_05]: doing similar things and I just reached
out to him and we were just talking and I
[SPEAKER_05]: was like hey man like Do you garden he's
like yeah?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like all right like you you want
some vegetable seeds, so I sent him a
[SPEAKER_05]: bunch of vegetables seeds and at the time
I was doing like a Asian heirloom chili
[SPEAKER_05]: variety like preservation run of like all
these different like southern Chinese
[SPEAKER_05]: peppers and all that kind of shit Just
because we don't really have too many of
[SPEAKER_05]: them here, so I'm trying to get them out
everywhere but uh I went and sent him all
[SPEAKER_05]: these different like from origin pepper
seeds that I had repopulated over the
[SPEAKER_05]: course of a couple seasons and he was like
yo like I think I threw in like a pack of
[SPEAKER_05]: like Some random cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean I don't remember something there
were a couple packs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I threw in there, but uh he's like yo like
Do you do this kind of stuff with me?
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure man, I love that shit and He's
like cool like let me let me hook you up,
[SPEAKER_05]: and he just fuck it I like every fucking
Continent you could imagine he just sent
[SPEAKER_05]: me all these fucking like you know 30 at
least 30 of each variety from anywhere in
[SPEAKER_05]: South America all over the coast of Africa
like fucking Asian places like over in the
[SPEAKER_05]: Middle East and shit northern like Iran
like crazy amounts of like land-raised
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff, and I just remember like going and
fucking talking starting to talk to him,
[SPEAKER_05]: and we just Hit it off, and he's like hey,
man like I'm uh I'm getting ready to go
[SPEAKER_05]: and do this thing and like at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just like Dude, I was messing is the
guy we're just we just knocked it off as
[SPEAKER_05]: friends right away and just like oh You
like this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you like this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, dude same like it was fucking great
and Fucking he's like I'm getting ready to
[SPEAKER_05]: go and make a big move like out of the
country actually and continue this type of
[SPEAKER_05]: search on my own like rather than just
going through all these different people
[SPEAKER_05]: that live in these areas like I want to go
so he ended up going and taking off over
[SPEAKER_05]: to Africa and He sent me a Lot of his
fucking library as far as like land-raised
[SPEAKER_05]: seed stock he took a ton with him out
there to go and do rape repopulations and
[SPEAKER_05]: his own expansions on the lines and stuff
like that which fuck yeah, and Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just gonna do some of the same here if
anything for myself and just to go and
[SPEAKER_05]: experience these things that Some of the
highs that I just haven't been able to go
[SPEAKER_05]: and experience, and I don't think many
others like I don't know what the fuck a
[SPEAKER_00]: Peruvian weed like That's the most
exciting part for me and why I like doing
[SPEAKER_00]: land races so much in a in a world where
we bald neck so much stuff and Even if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not the same thing a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very very similar like they're not
all lemon is lemon but Lemon G is a lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the lemon this you know lemon haze
is a lemon skunk is a you know they're
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar and finding different effects
and different flavor profiles especially
[SPEAKER_00]: That have like that no ceiling or you can
pick your CBD cultivar out of it Or you
[SPEAKER_00]: know you can go so many different
directions with land races It's constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it keeps you on your toes to as a
grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, dude it Keeps hearing your toes do it
the entire fucking time Like I've got a DD
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't slow down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need that shit Makes no sense like
they'll do things you've never seen before
[SPEAKER_05]: it's what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like they'll just shoot it's like
it'll be like a regular plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then it's like I'm a vine now And then
it just calls it quits on like having
[SPEAKER_05]: stability They'll go like these crazy
wispy little fucking branches all over the
[SPEAKER_05]: place They'll throw fucking like exterior
roots that go and fucking tap down in the
[SPEAKER_05]: dirt they fucking go and grow like almost
like like These leaf surface thorn
[SPEAKER_05]: sections that go and fucking Like it's
weird man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always around the petiole,
but they'll throw these little like horns
[SPEAKER_05]: on them There's so many different fucking
things about weed that we have no fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: clue about That are just hiding all over
the fucking world.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like as soon as like the internet
took off Like as far as like weed things
[SPEAKER_05]: and people start posting their own
experiences for fucking Jamaica or like
[SPEAKER_05]: Some dudes over in the Middle East and
shit you see and well like what's going on
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like your eyes just start
opening and opening And then once you
[SPEAKER_05]: start actually like putting your hands in
the dirt with these plants from these
[SPEAKER_05]: places It's just like oh, this is nothing
what I expected They'll go and surprise
[SPEAKER_05]: you every fucking time with the exception
of Africans interpenetrating for some
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking reason But yeah Yeah, we okay,
so we got to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your penalty in the Congo because and
the reason I ask is because I've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend over in Lesotho and He sent me A
bunch of crosses he was working with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Congo.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made a few hybrids with it even sent me
in isolation He did of the broad leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype that he found in it and a narrow
leaf phenotype So he kind of separated
[SPEAKER_00]: those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to get you over some too But I
don't know if you'd enjoy them because you
[SPEAKER_00]: said everything that you were fine that
had the Congo cross and it was heavy
[SPEAKER_05]: terpenaline and Yeah, so it's not any
There's tons of people that love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does great things.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great precursor and shit But it's
just like I'm interested in here is it can
[SPEAKER_00]: express itself in so many different ways
depending on what that cannabinoid profile
[SPEAKER_00]: is So when you say terpenaline,
what which one are you pulling out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it like that?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So There is this base undertone that just
goes in like hovers throughout all of them
[SPEAKER_05]: for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I could just pick it up It's just
it's just there and that's all I could
[SPEAKER_05]: taste and I it's definitely probably just
my own mental Perception of the thing is
[SPEAKER_05]: just like I had to find something I didn't
like, you know And for whatever reason it
[SPEAKER_05]: ended up being that ter profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just not a huge fan of it like and
Don't get me wrong the the Congo it was
[SPEAKER_05]: Congo chemical chem and bag appeal fucking
Beautiful like incredible great resin
[SPEAKER_05]: coverage the inside of it does this like
in it seemed to be pretty common
[SPEAKER_05]: throughout like a bunch of the congos is
like Close to the actual stem.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll have like a much tackier like Resin
content.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like it'll have like this great
surface coverage of trichromes and you
[SPEAKER_05]: know, like they go through the leaves and
all that shit but like for some reason
[SPEAKER_05]: like right at the Actual like stem base it
you would break it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just like it would just fucking tack
It'd probably be awesome and fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: extraction and all that kind of shit,
but Not for me The lasso though that you
[SPEAKER_05]: said like the lasso though is fucking
wicked that shit is Some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown quite a few Africans,
but I have not touched that lasso though
[SPEAKER_00]: yet Would you like about that one?
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, it was a profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never come across just straight like
shitty Chinese restaurant fried rice It
[SPEAKER_01]: was oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah It was weird man, like there's like
this sesame oil like so I cook like a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to be restaurants and all that
shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, then it's just like We translate so
easily with the smell and the taste and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff like that So it's like a lot of the
shit that I talk about is just gonna be
[SPEAKER_05]: mostly like Culinary like basis like
that's just my best association.
[SPEAKER_05]: So fried rice man Straight out the park
And that's probably a flavor profile most
[SPEAKER_00]: people know too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, it was like It didn't mess it
was as far as like flavor like it had like
[SPEAKER_05]: some herbaceous notes some almost like
eucalyptus II thing which was kind of Not
[SPEAKER_05]: expected but like more so like a peanut
butter thing Well, like if you were to go
[SPEAKER_05]: and make like a paint like a sesame paste
kind of but like really light on that
[SPEAKER_05]: everything else was like kind of like Like
I find I keep finding like a lots of like
[SPEAKER_05]: these eucalyptus II like minty like I just
refer to them as teal profiles.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just like Yeah, and with that and
the peanut buttery thing the taste was
[SPEAKER_05]: cool still really subtle it wasn't like a
turp bomb but Like the smell you crack it
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's like you just brought in a bag of
fucking fried rice It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that So you said you're gonna kind
of venture away from some of that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're gonna start doing more aphes
and pacis Yeah, that's the whole hopes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna I've always really liked the
Indica's the land races That's kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: like so the other Peru seeds I have I have
these Peru cross with mazari Sharif and
[SPEAKER_05]: Those ones seem really interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna probably end up doing I think I
got like Around 20 of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll do an open pollination of them and
then just do a segregation of that
[SPEAKER_05]: population Keep a couple cuts and then
just try to see what can come out of like
[SPEAKER_05]: that kind of hybrid once again I know
nothing about Peruvian stuff But like I
[SPEAKER_05]: know Casey brains was finding like a ton
of really awesome shit down in South
[SPEAKER_05]: America Like in the 90s and all that kind
of stuff So that with white widow being
[SPEAKER_05]: partial Brazilian like there's a lot of
cool shit hiding in South America that I
[SPEAKER_00]: know nothing about Yeah, I'm glad you
pointed out Casey brains the other day
[SPEAKER_00]: because fuck I hadn't even looked at those
seeds for a while I hadn't even heard his
[SPEAKER_00]: name in a while I didn't do anything
anymore, man Yeah, did he basically does
[SPEAKER_05]: the same thing boat he does he just goes
around and fucking collect seeds from
[SPEAKER_05]: around the world and it's just like I
Don't know we were talking about this the
[SPEAKER_05]: other day.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like that dude should get a lot more
fucking Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want well, you made a good point to
like he was the guy that wasn't like
[SPEAKER_00]: naming most of his stuff He was kind of
doing like the number Nomenclature if you
[SPEAKER_00]: will and I did I guess those names just
Didn't stick like an actual like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know the candy treat names fuck Like I
guess like I've heard I don't know I heard
[SPEAKER_05]: this or maybe it was a farm or something
But I guess he fucking like it was like
[SPEAKER_05]: initials and then like the number it
wasn't even like relative to like a
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking phenotype I guess it was just his
age when he made the line So it's like
[SPEAKER_05]: Casey 30 shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that's fucking true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can't be I don't feel like there
was a 36 and a 45 Yeah, I feel like those
[SPEAKER_00]: were pretty close to when they came out
Maybe I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I mean that he was
already out by the time I really got into
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis though.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to say we'd need Already set
aside at the time I don't know much about
[SPEAKER_05]: the guy personally like this is just you
know, like I said here say but Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: he made some fucking crazy shit his you
could still find like really like the 36
[SPEAKER_05]: was Super fruity like crazy turps almost
all of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was there was a couple swaggy ones
for sure, but like growing his stuff in
[SPEAKER_05]: like 2000 was that Like 10 Something like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fucking cool shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's a guy like Santa Rosa
turpentine or urban Urban tarp farm or
[SPEAKER_05]: something like that He's using all these
Casey brain stuff with the sour diesels
[SPEAKER_05]: and making these new washer strains I
don't know it's cool that people are
[SPEAKER_05]: coming across him again and He seems to be
going out and doing new collections.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'd be cool if something neat came out
Hell, yeah, dude so you Were very fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: generous and you blessed me with this
gigantic bag of fucking fire And I see a
[SPEAKER_00]: few crosses in there with one that you
made me drool About in the discord and
[SPEAKER_00]: that was that dumpster hash plant that we
I don't know much about that in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacific Northwest They haven't heard much
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you widen us as to what the dumpster
hash plant is?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's not so it's my It is my
favorite it is the one thing that I always
[SPEAKER_05]: have it's a It's just a fucking clone I
found in a bag of Bodhi seeds that I
[SPEAKER_05]: popped for fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just like this fucking one that
just stuck out and At the same time I was
[SPEAKER_05]: doing like a bunch of Panama's and Bubba's
and like different things like that and
[SPEAKER_05]: then I just had these like fucking shitty
little Dumpster hash plants going and they
[SPEAKER_05]: just would not grow for the life of them
and I just kind of wrote them off and I
[SPEAKER_05]: took clones of everything and just back up
or whatever and At the end of it is just
[SPEAKER_05]: like there's one fucking just caked little
fucking plant and It had this crazy like
[SPEAKER_05]: dryer sheet and curry fucking profile it
like like like cleaning products,
[SPEAKER_05]: but like also just like a nasty yellow
curry and Start going I scope it and shit
[SPEAKER_05]: the head look fucking awesome big bulbous
things no fucking stock really and The
[SPEAKER_05]: lowers they fucking stocked out like
crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's it was like a neat little fucking
Neat little plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never seen anything quite like it
there were a couple like similar in the
[SPEAKER_05]: batch but like this curry thing was just
Not only that but like with all these
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking land races I get paranoia like a
motherfucker Jesus Christ like testing
[SPEAKER_05]: these things is just like I'm fucking
holding a gun to my head.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like and then I find this thing
and now like it fucking It kicks me off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel great every time I'll get like that
nice daytime stone like that thing where
[SPEAKER_05]: when you're fucking just like Hanging out
you just go into your own world for a
[SPEAKER_05]: little while and then something you're
just like here something they're like
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're all good
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I definitely get that and I've
been telling my guys that too I've You
[SPEAKER_00]: know for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been the I love ties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all about that stuff The last few
years, you know as I'm aging and shit I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to get more into the into the
downs into the relax Yeah, I think that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think this and I ruined it for me because
we found a really fucking hazy one out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that Egyptian land race and oh My god,
it blew a Swami gas from Swami organic
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds He actually selected towards that
phenotype, but it was one of the last ones
[SPEAKER_00]: I had had where it makes everything
brighter It makes everything louder the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground kind of starts doing the wave thing
and you're just long and I was like man I
[SPEAKER_00]: just this stuff It's not for me like it
was when I was a teenager, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I'm not the I'm not the party guy
anymore I don't need the party.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh Then you talk about love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah talk about destroying a party
though Go and smoke a joint of that with
[SPEAKER_05]: some people that have never had it before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah It was crawling out of their skin
It's a it's a fun it's a fun game to go
[SPEAKER_05]: and play but man I cannot do it every day
anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these Like these anymore indica bays
are kind of what I'm going for anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: right now Hell yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I just thought we need to probably meet
up dumpster Donna with your dumpster hash
[SPEAKER_00]: plant Yeah Dumpster Donna was one that I
found out of some salami organic seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a Paki chocolate tie hybrid cross
back to the chocolate tie and I mean they
[SPEAKER_00]: were there was phenotypes all over the
board, but the one that I selected for it
[SPEAKER_00]: looked like a Paki plant with Thai leaves
on it and It had the Paki yield the Paki
[SPEAKER_00]: bud structure But the effect was like a
calmer tie and it was just beautiful But
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't it wasn't the flavor profile
you'd expect for it when that Paki got
[SPEAKER_00]: involved with the chocolate tie It just
made this funky wet garbage thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: explainer it to somebody they'd be like,
oh my god, you like that and I'm like fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah And if you're saying you're getting
nasty all kinds of stuff out of this
[SPEAKER_00]: dumpster hash plant the curry that sounds
really intriguing It was the first thing I
[SPEAKER_05]: found with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like odd shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's that That's what's special to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's unique and that's the kind
of stuff that I like to smoke Those are so
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never fucking smelled anything like that
going Chinese food restaurant like yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: all day long Please and with a peanut
butter taste like yes Are you are you
[SPEAKER_00]: going into these Chinese restaurants dress
like that though?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes The Senegal stuff too like you go and
like for some reason this whole fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: area right here like There's like these
fucking burnt tire like Sour skittle
[SPEAKER_05]: things that are all over that area and
it's as much as I hate sifting through a
[SPEAKER_05]: bunch of that It's worth it because these
some of the profiles that come out of it
[SPEAKER_05]: are just gnarly just like hot rubber sour
skittle Like those Senegalese those things
[SPEAKER_05]: were fucking awesome, man So that mixed
with like a fucking Paki tie or something
[SPEAKER_05]: like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be a fucking That'd be a fun
combination Did you ever get a chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: touch or smoke or do anything with the
Moroccan?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I Unfortunately have strayed away from
Moroccan because I haven't heard the best
[SPEAKER_05]: things I have I Have a pack of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think somewhere but they might be like a
Moroccan Congo cross or something like
[SPEAKER_05]: that Okay, I don't know I've never grown
Moroccan, but I imagine it's probably I
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't know I can see it being like a Weird
variation on like What I'm not saying this
[SPEAKER_05]: is the combination like but it would be
like a mix of like Afghani and like
[SPEAKER_05]: Congolese I could see Moroccan being like
I Don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like certain ways you can kind of
like pick out what certain regions stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: is gonna be like for some reason and
Africa there's like a lot of like really
[SPEAKER_05]: similar like baselines that run through
these things like veins and then like as
[SPEAKER_05]: soon as Like there's just It's like these
base flavors that just hang out and base
[SPEAKER_05]: set profiles but they just develop in
different ways in these different regions
[SPEAKER_05]: and I don't know for how much like Hash
making Morocco does and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could see them going and focusing all
towards like these hash varieties But I
[SPEAKER_05]: don't think flavors too big of a concern
because kind of hash Especially when
[SPEAKER_05]: you're doing that and just kind of goes
into the same like muddled flavor So I
[SPEAKER_05]: don't think they would express too hard
for like flavor profiles, but I don't fuck
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know I never grew them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a couple that were crossed to I'm
trying to remember what it was back then
[SPEAKER_00]: it was Some kind of purple strain,
but they came through like a really really
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like a potpourri Going on it wasn't
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't crazy about the high super
lethargic Yeah like if you would have let
[SPEAKER_00]: blonde hash go bad, you know Just age for
like like my uncle had this shit in his
[SPEAKER_00]: closet for like the last 10 years,
you know Kind of like that But I feel like
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you think it was like the actual pro
like ter profile?
[SPEAKER_05]: from the actual planet self Or do you
think it was?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a purple type that I was used to
smoking and I don't remember if that would
[SPEAKER_00]: have been like a purple Girl Scout cookies
or it was from a California breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that Bay Area, you know one those
typical like great Bay Something like that
[SPEAKER_00]: He had crossed it into what was then
called Katama from Katama Morocco and it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't until like a few years later that I
heard it not called Katama that I heard it
[SPEAKER_00]: called them the Bel dia or is that right
Bel dia Moroccan Bel dia, I believe that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what's called but I had never heard that
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just called it Katama and So I kind of
knew the purple strain that was in there
[SPEAKER_00]: So you notice when there's something
different, you know brought into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that potpourri type of thing It wasn't
strictly purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely was influenced somehow by
that Moroccan Interesting that would be a
[SPEAKER_05]: cool You got me and who knows I just
fucking like mine shot into like actually
[SPEAKER_05]: that that would make sense You can find
these cool potpourri things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like what do I have?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't had it pure though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know maybe it you know,
there's a lot of land races Just pure
[SPEAKER_00]: feral stock that can be pretty lackluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yeah, exactly Like you got it,
I don't know so like I do I like doing the
[SPEAKER_05]: preservation stuff, but then going and
doing like a Like the this guy that hooked
[SPEAKER_05]: me up with all these fucking his own
preservation shit from the start he He
[SPEAKER_05]: crossed a lot of his shit with this
chemdala chem, which is a chem D crossed
[SPEAKER_05]: with I 95 and It's I've grown out a ton of
them of just like that Senegalese hit with
[SPEAKER_05]: it the I did That's a beautiful plant,
man Yeah, and it's just towers it's
[SPEAKER_05]: beautiful but uh the the Senegalese cross
with the Kendall a chem like It added so
[SPEAKER_05]: much fucking resin to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like with the Senegalese it was like
that's crazy It's really fucking long
[SPEAKER_05]: stocks, but really good tackiness Like
pretty small not even pretty really small
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking resin heads, but they're like It's
just a different texture than you see in a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of different fucking stuff that's
going around now It's like these little
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking pinheads.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just like But uh with the Kendall
a chem it just added a million more of
[SPEAKER_05]: those and It's hard to bully of those
fucking land races around.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like it held pretty strong to its
fucking sativa like base, but Definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: cut the time down it went down from like a
12 to 14 down to like a solid 11 12 so
[SPEAKER_05]: that was nice, but uh Yeah, I like doing
the fucking mix it up one out crossing
[SPEAKER_00]: from a feral stock.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not that bad Yeah, who's to say how
feral it is because it's coming from a
[SPEAKER_05]: dude who's trait Like this dude is out in
Africa He's going and collecting stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's probably grown his own stuff He's
also has the wherewithal to be able to go
[SPEAKER_05]: and use the internet to go and send things
back and forth So he has some interest so
[SPEAKER_05]: as far as the term feral stock I I
sometimes have a problem with that because
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't claim that you know, like I can
only go as far as I could as far as I
[SPEAKER_05]: could say but it's like Who's to say
whoever told me that isn't lying?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know I came from that where they came
from and stuff like that Soon as it gets
[SPEAKER_05]: there that fucking line dies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So did this guy go out there and collect
them himself?
[SPEAKER_05]: I Don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did he go from a guy that's been growing
and selecting for years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh and Yeah, and I feel like that's any
more like the term feral stock it's That's
[SPEAKER_05]: a hard term to go and run with because
it's just if they're coming from someone
[SPEAKER_05]: they're coming from somewhere like There's
not a ton of ferals that people are
[SPEAKER_05]: sending on the internet anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of people that say they do
but Yeah, full power was that Indian land
[SPEAKER_05]: race exchange I mean it's a selection in a
field of plants that have been being grown
[SPEAKER_05]: over the course of a very long time for
select plants that I mean they collect
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds for the ones they like they're not
gonna fucking you know, so There is the
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome stuff Yeah, we Got the Indian tour
book because I didn't have a big
[SPEAKER_00]: collection of Indians.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, oh I'm gonna get in on this
one First time about seeds and along that
[SPEAKER_05]: which ones did you get from Indian land
rice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh We got the the Indian tour book So it
had like a pack from every region that
[SPEAKER_00]: they went to and collected and it came
with a book that had pictures of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that they were selecting seeds from
and Explaining the latitude longitude what
[SPEAKER_00]: they thought of these plants the smells
and the flavors they were getting off of
[SPEAKER_00]: it It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so do you consider that?
[SPEAKER_05]: So what in your I would say that's
heirloom Okay, when I think of barrel
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, I think The seeds that are falling
in the field, you know That would be land
[SPEAKER_00]: or fair land race and then anything
growing outside of that condition would
[SPEAKER_00]: then be considered an heirloom Yeah,
what do you think I?
[SPEAKER_05]: Would agree with that assessment also
Heirloom and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's I mean heirloom is just work
generations off of one original stock,
[SPEAKER_05]: so Yeah, you're you're right with all that
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I just want to I'm curious cuz no,
I'm double checking my work and somebody's
[SPEAKER_05]: been doing it longer than me I'm just
curious what other people's thoughts are
[SPEAKER_05]: on these things, you know So it's like
what I could consider feral is very easily
[SPEAKER_05]: different to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Yeah, no, I would I would consider the
same thing but to be fair if it's I Don't
[SPEAKER_05]: know if I would still consider I consider
a feral more so like Seeds falling off of
[SPEAKER_05]: a plant in a wild situation rather like
whether that's like Right in the field
[SPEAKER_05]: just falling straight back on the graph
Yeah, but if it's like a field that you're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing selection on and stuff like that and
then I don't know there's so many
[SPEAKER_05]: different things that could come out of it
because like All these fields are getting
[SPEAKER_05]: retilled and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you are throwing all these so you have
feral seeds that go and fall I would say
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be a cultivated land race.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay, cool Yeah, I don't these are
just things they like spin off in my head
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's like how can this term be?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thought of differently So like I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like these conversations And you're not
only breeding cannabis you're breeding you
[SPEAKER_00]: did what zinnias all kinds of different
flowers all kinds of different peppers
[SPEAKER_00]: Squashes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you find the time?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh Dude, I just Go to sleep real late and
wake up real early The life I am I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: have kids yet and there it's uh,
you know, so save some time with that and
[SPEAKER_05]: I Don't know man, it's it's something I
care a lot about I got a full-time job I
[SPEAKER_05]: got a fucking small farm that we run I
help with Few other people's things around
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We grew up in a farming community still
farming community like I Don't know man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's just something I love so it
never really feels like work unless I'm at
[SPEAKER_05]: work, you know, so I Don't know it takes a
lot of time but it's time that I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: mind losing right now we were talking
about a lot of the different phones that
[SPEAKER_00]: you had in your area and The stuff that
was popular Around you and you'd mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: the Death Star obviously The dumpster hash
plant the lemon G.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one that you said that I had no
idea what it was the lidium The eludium
[SPEAKER_05]: q36 exploding reactor That's awesome Yes a
old Marvin the Martian reference From
[SPEAKER_05]: Looney Tunes back in the day the eludium
q36 is a oh So it is There was a group
[SPEAKER_05]: that was growing a whole bunch of really
nice Lavenders Indiana bubblegums bubba's
[SPEAKER_05]: things like that Also, this may be a
precursor is to like why I like linalool
[SPEAKER_05]: and shit so much but uh, they Were going
and started making their own lines and
[SPEAKER_05]: shit like that and made this one called
the eludium which Actually, they might
[SPEAKER_05]: have made one before that so there's
another line that was called its sister
[SPEAKER_05]: line It's called the new and it was a
bubba kush lavender put back onto a
[SPEAKER_05]: Lavender clone and then there was the
eludium q36, which is the bubba kush
[SPEAKER_05]: Lavender put onto a Hawaiian Indica herb
bubba kush lavender onto bubba I think and
[SPEAKER_05]: then on to Hawaiian Indica and That's what
made the eludium but it's just like a
[SPEAKER_05]: bubba on steroids with Just way slower
fetch like it's miserable plant to grow
[SPEAKER_05]: like it is a beautiful little golf ball
like Resonance as fuck like great smells
[SPEAKER_05]: like it was If people had eludium next to
like a fucking bag of cookies,
[SPEAKER_05]: no one's picking cookies It's and it's
something that's been around for a little
[SPEAKER_05]: while now those dudes and To be honest
like that lineage.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's the bubba the lavender and the
Hawaiian Indica If it's back crossed on
[SPEAKER_05]: the bubba, I don't remember exactly Those
guys disappeared pretty quickly after I
[SPEAKER_05]: first saw it and I just the only thing
that I still see is the eludium the nuke
[SPEAKER_05]: was just a Lavender potpourri bomb like
just beautiful pinky light violet purple
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking buds Beautiful fucking weird But
yeah, dude those those two were chef's
[SPEAKER_05]: kiss Plus that bubblegum the lavender like
all the shit those guys were fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: pumping out was incredible and Yeah,
we're fortunate though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ludium still around I Had it For a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to get it back again But we still
have like island sweet skunk around That's
[SPEAKER_05]: been around for a long time around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was popular here, too Yeah,
and I don't know you with Canada Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah border towns.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Yeah, there's a There's a lot of cool
shit that went around for a long time the
[SPEAKER_05]: g-13s that went around here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're fucking nuts, dude There were
several of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's there's this one with a
variegation that I have been looking for
[SPEAKER_05]: For a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another one that went out to
Colorado and was never seen again and Me
[SPEAKER_05]: and the guy that took it out to Colorado
are still looking for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a super squatty little fucking like
it almost looked like It wasn't like a
[SPEAKER_05]: pine tree it like it's it's side branching
would almost like sprog itself It was just
[SPEAKER_05]: like this little fucking like hedge that
would just stout as fuck and just throw
[SPEAKER_05]: these fucking potent ass buds But then
yeah dumpster the woody haze Woody haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh Dude that woody haze was gnarly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a dumpster and Super silver haze
cross I believe and it was just how it
[SPEAKER_05]: looked beautiful Yeah We I mean there's a
Four-way cut that went around here.
[SPEAKER_05]: That one was really fucking great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like this raunchy fucking like
burning tire There's a ton of people that
[SPEAKER_05]: say it was the same as the Fairfax.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so Yeah, I think it was a
different one There's tons of people ever
[SPEAKER_05]: poppet seeds man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't always have to be the same cut
and most likely and Yeah, I don't know we
[SPEAKER_05]: were fortunate where it's like a lot of
the Older lines they still hang out around
[SPEAKER_05]: the area and are back and forth You'll see
them for a little wave and then they
[SPEAKER_05]: disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this mango Afghan Grow green daddy
says does boogie have any tips or advice
[SPEAKER_00]: for growing the more unique land races in
smaller areas not height limited though
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I personally like going and If
it's a new one that I'm just getting into
[SPEAKER_05]: Have no idea about it aside from the
assumption that okay because it's from
[SPEAKER_05]: this area.
[SPEAKER_05]: It probably has a Closer yard the equator
Fucking leggy or they're gonna get like
[SPEAKER_05]: then it goes north and south and then as
you go fucking I feel like a weatherman
[SPEAKER_05]: right now
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, we might listen to this dude Yeah,
I mean if you're in this area you can go
[SPEAKER_05]: and anticipate that you're gonna have your
plants are you're just gonna fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: explode You can kind so I like to go and
kind of just like navigate what my
[SPEAKER_05]: expected flowering time if you're getting
seeds from somebody and they could give
[SPEAKER_05]: you a really good fucking information
about like what to expect Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also buy seeds from people that test their
fucking gear because if they can't tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you how to grow it Fuck um, can you say
that one more time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't hear it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Okay, buy seeds from people who test
their gear like it's yeah for the people
[SPEAKER_05]: in the back Fucking wild that people are
just like take my money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah What I made this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah So a I Don't have the fortune of
knowing What these things grow like so I
[SPEAKER_05]: can only go off of self-assumption for a
lot of them like on the map and shit like
[SPEAKER_05]: oh Let's so though pretty south so there
could have the potential of being like
[SPEAKER_05]: some pretty fucking like squatty little
guys and stuff, but also that fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: Equatorial thing is still in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just like has the potential to
blow up so South of the equator is a
[SPEAKER_05]: little different than north, but also
India weird thing just read Do your
[SPEAKER_05]: diligence when you're going and popping
seeds if you want to like fully Understand
[SPEAKER_05]: what's going on ask as many questions as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let me expand on it because I have a
question for you personally with You have
[SPEAKER_00]: you've done a few equatorials,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah What flowering time are you using
with them usually and how quick are you
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering them?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so most the time if I'm doing a test
run of them in a Isolated room,
[SPEAKER_05]: they'll go on to like a ten and a half
hour light nothing too crazy light on ten
[SPEAKER_05]: and a half hours and I don't want to go
too crazy with it and just like go and cut
[SPEAKER_05]: up because you could speed the shit up But
like ten and a half hours kind of sits
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty still with them off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go and sprout them Vegem for about
two weeks and then throw out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just looking for like basically what
they expected stretches and then
[SPEAKER_05]: understanding what the baseline terpene
profile is so I'll grow them in something
[SPEAKER_05]: like one gallon pot go and put Ten to
twenty of them together then just go and
[SPEAKER_05]: flower them real close together Yeah,
I mean a lot of the stuff that I do I Just
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of stress test a lot of things see
how it goes if it does really well in one
[SPEAKER_05]: area I'm gonna go and probably continue it
like if it's grown in a Stress induced
[SPEAKER_05]: environment like these small pots for
these equatorial sativas and shit like
[SPEAKER_05]: that You're gonna very quickly see your
fucking perm expressions You're gonna go
[SPEAKER_05]: and very quickly see how fast things go
and try to reach Up to the light ahead of
[SPEAKER_05]: other things You're gonna see a base
glance as to what you're going and and
[SPEAKER_05]: this is like I'm not saying you got to
have some seeds to go and do this like
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't something like you have a 10
pack and you want to do a preservation if
[SPEAKER_05]: that's the case fucking open pollinate
that shit and do that really nicely but
[SPEAKER_05]: for like testing these like equatorial
things and just getting a base reference
[SPEAKER_05]: is see how these are I Like kind of
stressing them see what they do and If
[SPEAKER_05]: it's something that we can work with and
there's some nice smells that come off of
[SPEAKER_05]: it Let's continue with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if not, like I have the seeds then at
least but Probably not gonna continue with
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, man tons of good information
there That's pretty much what I'm doing as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do one gallon pots I do 12 or 12 12 from
seed I flower them right away from seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've been using 1113 that more
Hawaiian type deal, but ten and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: that's cool you bringing it down your You
know, you're not going for yield when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking through land races for the
first time So everything's just get it
[SPEAKER_00]: done fast and that's cool that you brought
down to ten and a half I don't think I you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, I going from Hybrids and starting
with some some of those doing 12 12 on
[SPEAKER_00]: practically everything And then realizing
not all land races were like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you had to bring that light
quite a bit So I went to the 1113.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't grown anything outside of that
yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I Like the 1113 for everything else Even
my like just regular lines I do and shit
[SPEAKER_05]: like it's I Like the 1113.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think them having a little longer sleep
is nice I think a lot takes off at the
[SPEAKER_05]: night in the dark and Yeah, just I just
really love that light cycle seems that
[SPEAKER_05]: like during winter too you get like really
nice colors coming out when you go and do
[SPEAKER_05]: that 1113 the ten and a half I Honestly,
I was doing a lot of things just 12 12 for
[SPEAKER_05]: a long time I got into doing 11 and a half
for Yeah 11 for a long time just because I
[SPEAKER_05]: Was doing everything together just testing
and because it's the TVs together then uh
[SPEAKER_05]: Over the course of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just fucking Graduated into doing this
land race thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just seem to respond better and they
have like a Better flower cluster
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes I it doesn't make sense to me
but it's just like things that have
[SPEAKER_05]: happened for me using that if they just
seem to kind of build a little squatter in
[SPEAKER_05]: But granted that's like a clone off the
mother so I can't really use that as a
[SPEAKER_05]: solid reference So your your clones always
gonna be like if you have a seed mother
[SPEAKER_05]: And go and take a fucking clone off of
that seed mother your clone is always
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be Slightly different than the
seed mother, so I can't really contribute
[SPEAKER_05]: that To the strain itself or whatever but
I Don't know you just got to play around
[SPEAKER_05]: with it test things experiment see what
works That one works for me good points
[SPEAKER_00]: man all good information I Really really
appreciate all that man fuck I'm learning
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit here, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that Can I ask why you said that
you use the seed mother is DNA not DNA So
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there is a significant difference
when you go and take a plant's taproot
[SPEAKER_05]: away And I just don't think that you're
able to have the same metabolism and then
[SPEAKER_05]: your plant itself is just gonna go and
result in a fucking Because it has a
[SPEAKER_05]: different nutrient uptake system.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a different expression.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's tied to that and that's all I don't
think there's anything it's still the same
[SPEAKER_05]: thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll still have the same profiles and
stuff I just noticed a change in the way
[SPEAKER_05]: the actual like bud structure looks to a
point and granted That could be also
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental, but I probably a little bit
easier to take care of over a long period
[SPEAKER_05]: of time yeah, and I love seed mothers and
shit, but they gotta go eventually and I
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't know it's a It's just my experience
and once again like everything that I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: saying this is just my experience I
implore everybody to please go out and if
[SPEAKER_05]: you're wanting to if you're an Ariana
grower and want to try synthetics go
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking try synthetics learn fucking teach
yourself something new like it's fun to
[SPEAKER_05]: get out of the way for a second see it
from a different perspective and then go
[SPEAKER_05]: and fucking get back into the thing that
you're really into Maybe you won't maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: you fucking love synthetics then but like
what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just don't fucking learn man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like It's it's fun Go make a ferment go
fucking do all the shit like you want to
[SPEAKER_05]: grow something but you You're afraid of
about flower height and shit like that
[SPEAKER_05]: Figure it out bonsai trees exist,
man Just fucking play around like it's for
[SPEAKER_05]: you Like it doesn't have to be for
everybody else if it's something you want
[SPEAKER_05]: to do just fucking do it Don't worry about
what other people are gonna fucking say
[SPEAKER_05]: especially with the internet bullshit like
There are so many dummies They just love
[SPEAKER_05]: yelling into the void.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just fucking do your thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to make seeds?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that's my biggest PSA if you want
to make seeds fucking make seeds like from
[SPEAKER_05]: just I implore you to be a Little focused
though Yeah If you intend on giving them
[SPEAKER_05]: out Please have the intentions that you
would want from receiving from somebody
[SPEAKER_05]: exactly, but You want to have fun?
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't make some seeds It's not hard
anymore like just go buy a pack you find
[SPEAKER_05]: some school shit like Get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much harder to clean up a gene pool
than it is the muddy it up Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: you want to have fun like if you want to
learn about breeding fucking grow peppers
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the easiest fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is such a simple step like you have a
very simple understanding as to like oh
[SPEAKER_05]: male flower goes on the stamen You you
pollinate it right there like you get to
[SPEAKER_05]: see the actual fruit development You get
to see the seeds see how they develop you
[SPEAKER_05]: grow the seeds out You see how the
generation looks if it's like two
[SPEAKER_05]: different varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just self pollinating the pepper.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not really I mean It's cool,
but like you're not making anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just continuing but uh yeah,
dude, just if you want to learn about pot
[SPEAKER_05]: and Plant numbers are something that weird
you out and with good reason that shit's
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking wild It's crazy Just grow fucking
vegetables man, you can teach yourself
[SPEAKER_05]: everything you need to know it opens up
your mind it goes and teaches you new ways
[SPEAKER_05]: of doing things new ways of looking at
things it's It's the closest you can get
[SPEAKER_05]: to having a Thousand fucking pot plants is
by having a thousand pepper plants and

[SPEAKER_05]: giveaways I'm not really asking for
anything or we could set up stuff for a
[SPEAKER_05]: charity That would be fucking tight and
like go and have it go towards a
[SPEAKER_05]: foundation That would be ultimately the
cool thing Any of that So we could try to
[SPEAKER_05]: like set up something where like once a
month I just send you a Bundle and we
[SPEAKER_05]: could just go and set it up for like a
charity or something.

we could ever fucking grow I was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: give out a couple packs.

have a game show that we play over there
[SPEAKER_00]: on the same program It's called do or dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've heard of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay But we have two guys that go
head-to-head and it's basically Like truth
[SPEAKER_00]: or dare, but everything's a dare Sometimes
the dare is doing a dab and if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: do the dare you have to take a dab So
sometimes it's just taking a dab or doing
[SPEAKER_00]: a dab It's an hour of heavy smoking,
you know, just breaking the fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: stigma, you know, you're not gonna
overdose on cannabis We're just gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: leave having a good time and the prize
that we usually give away is like seeds
