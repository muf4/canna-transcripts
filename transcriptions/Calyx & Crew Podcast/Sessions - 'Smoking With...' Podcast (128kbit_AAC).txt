[SPEAKER_03]: What is up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here with Josh and Garrett from the
Smoking With Podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What up?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for inviting us on, man.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an honor to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anytime.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's the weather over there?
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are on the West Coast,
but we had a heater today and it was
[SPEAKER_03]: rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we had a heater for our area.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's like a spicy 72 degrees over
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's sweating, breaking out the
shorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: People out barbecuing, man, we're smelling
it, getting all hungry over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a beautiful day, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful day.
[SPEAKER_00]: First night.
[SPEAKER_05]: First beautiful day in a long,
long, long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yesterday was like, but today this is the
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had an interesting winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That last outdoor season was really rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, really rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping for a better one this year
that that heat will keep up and I can
[SPEAKER_03]: finish some flowers a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that'll be dope, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like actually get a full season.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Washington's really hard to get that full
season in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, such a bitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys host another podcast called
the Smoking With Podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you tell us a little bit about
that while I hit this dab?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, me and Garrett have been friends for
a long time and smoking buddies for a
[SPEAKER_05]: while.
[SPEAKER_05]: And shit, we got really into like the
nerdy side of weed, like just started deep
[SPEAKER_05]: dive in and watching videos.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, Garrett was growing there
in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I kind of grew,
started growing shortly after him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just always had these deep ass long
growing conversations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally we were like,
you know, we should be we should be
[SPEAKER_05]: recording this.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is this is stuff that I feel like
other people would want to listen to.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, eventually we got down to
buying the stuff we needed and recorded,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, we didn't even buy the stuff
for episode number one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Episode number one, we actually had a
buddy at my work.
[SPEAKER_05]: His name was Greg.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the title of the first episode
of Smoking With Greg.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's just a sound guy for our work or
for my work.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did a lot of in-house commercials and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they needed a production team.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just asked them, I was like,
hey, dude, we're trying to do a podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know shit about Dick, about
recording or like audio or anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I really love your help.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he so graciously let us come over to
his little apartment and use his mics and
[SPEAKER_05]: his setup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, got the ball rolling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how many episodes did you guys get in
before you're like, we're going to do
[SPEAKER_03]: this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we're going to invest in some
equipment and start doing this ourselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: One.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that first episode, pretty much
beyond that, like right after that,
[SPEAKER_00]: we went and went on Amazon, bought these
mics that are in the shot today and bought
[SPEAKER_00]: one audio box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't really know how to use it
very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a USB one upgraded or got
another one because Josh was out of town
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had to do that from afar just
because of his job.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we got the one that we're using
today, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a pod track, a pod track before
and it's got like four sound by options
[SPEAKER_00]: for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got four channels and it's I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was our latest purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a camera as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't work very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of a shitty purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's all it's all in the in
the learning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, from like episode two,
I would say we invested into at least
[SPEAKER_00]: these mics to get good audio quality,
because that was one of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: like was priority for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is, you know, we listened to podcasts and
some of them, you know, just don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the best quality just audio wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's kind of hard to listen to
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was one of the things that we
were just like dead set.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we have to have at least some sort of,
you know, at least mid range quality mic
[SPEAKER_00]: and landed on these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sound pretty, pretty good,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming in very decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the smoking with podcasts, you started
this just your smoke buddies.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're hanging out, smoking all the time,
getting into these deep conversations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did it go from there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what it still is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just smoking?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it as we, I guess, mature as
growers in like cannabis, we're both in
[SPEAKER_05]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's it's evolved into more of like a
grow talk kind of situation where,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, we try to cover some topics or
some news that's related to the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, you know, some tidbits information we
got or, you know, latest grow or product
[SPEAKER_05]: review.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we always try to keep that aspect of
keeping it like loose and free.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, if we want to talk about
something totally sidebar, we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, that happens often,
especially with guests, because the whole
[SPEAKER_05]: criteria for us doing this was we wanted
people to come on the show and feel like
[SPEAKER_05]: they were smoking with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we wanted the listeners at home.
[SPEAKER_05]: To feel like, oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I feel like I'm at a smoke sesh
right now with these guys and wanted to
[SPEAKER_05]: keep it really like low key and and
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our first guests weren't super experienced
podcasters.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it kind of helped ease them in by,
you know, it's just a regular conversation
[SPEAKER_05]: and we're going to pass around a joint.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we kind of that's the one
thing we want to keep going forward is
[SPEAKER_05]: that that vibe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, that's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people there at home,
especially stoners that are into like our
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of niche of podcasting.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they're looking for is not
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we all know we love information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Learning more about this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can find some other way to
incorporate something into your grow,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's going to work with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you get down that wormhole.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just keep going down that wormhole
and learning more and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as stoners, there's also so much
attention time that you have for it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, before you start going off into
the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it gets too serious, they kind of
throw me off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've listened to quite a few that are
very, very scientific cannabis podcasts
[SPEAKER_03]: and I can listen to them and I love them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can only listen to so much before
I'm like, OK, I need to take this
[SPEAKER_03]: information and.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, break that down, then I'll take
some more, you know, so it helps to break
[SPEAKER_03]: that ice, especially when you're getting
guests on to throw curveballs like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I will be doing with you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to ask each of you though,
really quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Individually.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your favorite episode?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to quantify that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think when we were on, we were just
recently on another podcast with Derek.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asked us a very similar question,
and it's very hard to nail it down because
[SPEAKER_00]: there, especially our guest episodes,
there's just so much information packed in
[SPEAKER_00]: there as well as like people's story and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's hard to just like,
say, one episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think my favorite type of episode is
when we would just get stupid high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'll break it into a type is when
we just get dumb high.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start off talking about weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah, like you said, it just kind of
just goes in a completely different
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are fun because you at a certain
point in the conversation, the mics aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: in front of you anymore in your head that
you're just you're just talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you don't you don't have any
expectation for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are just so freelance when
having guests on it, there's more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: structure to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to dig into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are great in their own right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, like I said, there's nuggets of
information and stuff like that that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get from these people about,
you know, the way they grow or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah, the freelance freeform smoking
just episodes are really, really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't say a favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got one that's been coming to my mind
lately.
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't I guess I'll give the political
put it out front.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love every single one.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of our guests.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm glad that they gave us the time
that they did.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, most people, especially the
breeder episodes, like I learned so much
[SPEAKER_05]: just from talking to somebody for an hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're super cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, man, my favorite was like we had this
girl on named Leah, but we had done a back
[SPEAKER_05]: to back.
[SPEAKER_05]: So right before we had her on,
we were doing another recording with my
[SPEAKER_05]: homie Yonder.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was just there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like he was like, yeah, I was like,
you want to stick around, dude?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you can just keep smoking with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was like, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, like, we just surprised guests on
this other podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, it was really fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: We smoked and, you know, he actually
brought some stuff to that one,
[SPEAKER_05]: too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, oh, OK, this ended up being
OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was just a super long session.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, yeah, fuck it, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was already high at that point.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it sounded like I'd gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's certainly an evolution to
our podcast, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's those days where we would go for
like two or three hours and put that whole
[SPEAKER_00]: episode together and would just go off on
just the most random, random things we
[SPEAKER_00]: could find, whatever was in the news or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just kind of a funny story.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would talk about it and then have our
own opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah, no, definitely we've kind of
gone into this more cannabis niche and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're still open to having whoever on and
talking about anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've had, you know, people,
yoga instructors do, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Leah, you were just talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like a very mindful type person.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like more spirituality, mindfulness,
like positivity kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we've had people who were into
cooking.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, I mean, I've had people in Oklahoma
that we did like a Pokemon card episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty fun with my homie Riley.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's a man, too, but like 90 percent
of the episode was like Pokemon cards.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the ones that are unexpected like
that, you know, if it's too structured,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not fun anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have those fucking hooks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't even ask you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see Josh is over there with the joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I saw Garrett with a joint
earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit, you guys are in the same room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have swore Josh was out somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I tell him that all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, it looks like we're in two
different places, but we're always in the
[SPEAKER_04]: same spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you guys smoking on today?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the Singapore Sling.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a Tiki Madman collab situation from
a while ago that we had at our facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I first started working there,
the first iteration of this that I tried
[SPEAKER_05]: was like not not good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like you're going very easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was pretty trash, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I was it was harsh.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, oh, man, this is like,
this can't be what we're putting out all
[SPEAKER_05]: the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, like in my head,
I wasn't going to say that at a brand new
[SPEAKER_05]: job.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was like, damn, dude, this is this
is rough.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, we tried it a couple
more times and it just never got the legs.
[SPEAKER_05]: It never got to where it was going to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then they're like, hey, we want it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We really want this to work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they tried it one more time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, this last time, dude,
it's it's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's got potential.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, OK, well, you know,
we tweak this a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd fuck with this hardcore.
[SPEAKER_05]: It smells good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a good structure now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, the high is pretty great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty focused.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more like on the hybrid sativa side
of life for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't have a lot of those at our
facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the shit is like knockout,
like straight indica put you down into the
[SPEAKER_00]: floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones we do are like the citrus
turps, which are seem like in in at least
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, that's like the bottom of
people's choice for terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those ones we have also, they're
they're a sherb cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's emergency from see junkie.
[SPEAKER_00]: They released it a little while ago,
but it's sure to blow pops, orange,
[SPEAKER_00]: orange, blue pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got citrus, but it also has,
like, some sherb to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it it kind of is a good segue,
I guess, into it rather than it just being
[SPEAKER_00]: like full force trop cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the name drop at the top cookies,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We we have a very love hate relationship
with the drop cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all dangly motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like the bud tastes so good when
chocolate cookies is grown right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really, really tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the high, it's not bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the best, but it's not bad at
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just growing her.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's just kind of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could tell people with warm cookies,
tropic and cookies at the end that grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like you got a finger in the
bottle at the end of sex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're like, oh, that was nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you go to harvest it and you're
like, I got fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like this small after they dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just tiny little pinner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are some pretty flowers,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they taste good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have their place.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, yeah, it takes some patience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Extracts.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when did both of you get into growing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what was your favorite?
[SPEAKER_03]: First experience with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's chronologically.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's hard to put a date on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly when.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know it was roughly when I was
around 20, 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was 21 because we had
dispensaries here and I was able I was
[SPEAKER_00]: buying weed out of dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 21 will say that we I've been hold up
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been smoking since I was 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I first first got introduced
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And was a really off and on with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then had some friends whose parents
grew and stuff like that and was
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly around weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had access to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just and then I got to the point to
where I was like smoking daily like I am
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it got to a point to where me and
my buddy were just like, we really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a different buddy before I met Josh
and started growing with him.
But.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided that we wanted to grow the weed
and hope in hopes to make some money,
[SPEAKER_00]: not make money off it, but like,
I guess, recoup our money from the like
[SPEAKER_00]: spending it on dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than spending it at the Dispo,
that weed is kicking in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of rambling here as tends to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we got some we got some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ordered some up out of like Amsterdam
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That he was a real big fan of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we decided to grow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like sketchy style,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like send them a money order and then hope
the seeds come later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it was his money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was totally OK with it happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, all right, if you want to do
that, man, like whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we grew those in a kind of fucky
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew them in soil to start under some
like CFL bulbs, like two of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he had been reading a lot about
like DWC and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, I think I want to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he was like, I think I want to
transplant the ones that we have in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were about like yay big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know why we thought that that
would be a good idea, but we were brand
[SPEAKER_00]: new to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're like, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, all right, you think this is
going to work?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, yeah, you just got to wash
off the roots and set them in this
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroton stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, all right, man,
like whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like out of the I think we had like five
or six plants, like three, two or three of
[SPEAKER_00]: them made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had swapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had bought like one of those Blurple
lights off Amazon for like a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones with the fans that are awful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen some really good, but off of a
couple of those brands, I know what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about, but like, god damn,
now I can't even think of the name of them
[SPEAKER_03]: either.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like Viper Spectra Viper Spectra was
one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was like Bloom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bloom Plus was kind of like yellow.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a few of them, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Viper Spectra are the ones that come
to mind the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was like the onboard fans that would,
you know, blow all the heat away from the
[SPEAKER_03]: light and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I've seen some really pretty
buds on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a matter of your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This wasn't this wasn't like a bootleg
version of not this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we didn't know shit about
environment or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were growing under this little under
the stairs closet in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, we did decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was it was it wasn't successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say I don't I don't ever
remember really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even think of harvesting that bud
like I can't even remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how like I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some really, really dumb stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I continue to do dumb stuff,
but I'm a little more calculated with it
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're never going to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, 24 7 ain't going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was my introduction to,
you know, grow and weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually, you know, did some
buttoning stuff and then finally made my
[SPEAKER_00]: way into a grow here in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So did Garrett influence you, Josh?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, like a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking about it at the time we
were working together, just like started
[SPEAKER_05]: construction together, like we were doing
some like remodel type stuff with this
[SPEAKER_05]: investor guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had been to his house.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd smoked over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd seen, you know, the tent or the little
gross space, you know, with the blurple
[SPEAKER_05]: light, you'd open it up and like,
oh, God.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then let your eyes adjust for like
three seconds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you could actually see the plant,
you know, like fucking around with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, okay, well, they're doing
the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, I'd seen when they
started doing the DWC, there was the like
[SPEAKER_05]: three in there in the five gallon buckets.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I remember that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And shortly after that time, my brother
hit me up and he is like, hey,
[SPEAKER_05]: I started growing this weed plant,
but I don't know what's wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's wrong with it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you figure it out?
[SPEAKER_05]: And he asked me because he knew I knew
people who grow weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, he's like,
I don't know anybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm like, okay, well, let me see what's
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, send me a picture of your plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he sends me this picture and it's a
fucking like, you know, 18 inch plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's in a like, you know, those soup
bowls, but are also mugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's got the little mug handle on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like bigger mug.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he had it in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would say maybe like a solo cup and a
half worth of dirt for this 18 inch plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any grain angels?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like just sitting in soup pretty
much.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he had, he had it growing in the
window sill, but like facing the south
[SPEAKER_05]: side of the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was never like any direct
sunlight ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just always like getting ambient
sunlight from the window.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So right off the bat, I don't know a lot
about a lot right now, but I know that you
[SPEAKER_05]: need lights to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that you can't just put it in your
windowsill and do the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's at least got to be like outside,
like catching a lot of sun, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you can't, that's number one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, number two, like that's
not a pot, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you need to get it out of the cup and
into like an actual pot for plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, I'm like, that's,
that's what I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was like, okay, well, like,
do you want to take it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I can't grow it any bigger than it
is now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, sure, man, but it's
probably going to die.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I was like, it's already in a bad
spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks hella sick.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like turning yellow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got different spots on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like spider mites too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just like, like this plant was
doomed to fail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, fuck it, dude,
send it to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he gives it to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I go buy some shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've like bought these lights off of a
like offer up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We went and met some sketchy dude who used
to grow some like black market grow into
[SPEAKER_05]: coma.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was like, yeah, not to coma.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like more on the federal way side of
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like kind of like out in the cuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're over there and he just,
you know, shows up in this SUV,
[SPEAKER_05]: sells us these lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I shit you not dude gets into like a
fucking other car.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a charger that's already parked on
the same lot and drives off bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it was so weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so sketch.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, dude, he just like,
I feel like these lights are stolen or
[SPEAKER_05]: something.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, we took them anyways.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were like, fuck it, dude, it's offer
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not going to say anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to say anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: We gave him the money.
[SPEAKER_05]: We took the things.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a different area code.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just, we drove back south and then I
was like, okay, so I took one of these.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like one of those Magnum XXL like,
uh, man, did I have a metal hallway?
[SPEAKER_05]: And at first I don't remember something.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, it was not efficient.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was hella hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was HPS.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little orange.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, HPS, uh, it was doing the thing
thousand watt.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like hung it and I put it over this
little plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's like, I think I transplanted it
into like a plastic one gallon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and it came back to life, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just said they'd lived.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, okay, well, now I actually
have to grow this fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it didn't die.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, so now I'm like researching and I'm
looking at all this shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm asking Garrett a million and seven
questions, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, oh, what about this?
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, like, he's letting me
borrow newts and shit like that and coming
[SPEAKER_05]: and checking on the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, we flowered this thing out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We ended up like, he had some pollen from
one of his plants and we ended up seeding
[SPEAKER_05]: like half of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we got hella seeds off of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we still have them to this day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this, like a supposedly the bag seed
that my brother grew was from Acapulco
[SPEAKER_05]: gold, but.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I can't confirm or deny that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, I'm not going to call it that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I'm not going to say this is a
land race without knowing for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was crossed to, um,
tangerine dream seeds that I had got when
[SPEAKER_00]: I went up to Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they just somehow like was in my
pocket when I got home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like went up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some weed, um, smoke that weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got home and there was seeds in
my pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a tangerine dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how they got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that there was a mail out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, that, that went to this Acapulco
gold and we have some seeds here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, somebody just ran them recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I sent them to a homie over
there in New York and they're currently
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see how those things go.
[SPEAKER_05]: The old ass seeds, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't know, like five years ago
now, like five, six years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, like, I mean that I got a bunch
of bud off of it too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we smoked it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was hella successful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I felt good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt like I had a green thumb.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, yeah, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do no wrong with plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I did my second run.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a natural at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you lay off on the psycho one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was an awesome boomerang guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: You went with this, this horrible sketchy
Tacoma story about picking up lights and
[SPEAKER_03]: then three seeds in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you guys are from Washington
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I apologize to my Tacoma people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I love Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like most Tacoma people,
you'd be like, I don't fuck with Tacoma.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most Tacoma people would be like,
Hey, well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: The answer is always, well, this part of
Tacoma is okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's never like, Oh, well,
Tacoma is fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always like, well, this, this one
section, if you drive over to that part of
[SPEAKER_05]: Tacoma, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's like mansions and like,
totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't talk about like the south side.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't talk about the east side.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not, you don't talk about hilltop
really.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's just like, Oh, well,
like the north end of Tacoma, like
[SPEAKER_05]: downtown.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been to some sketchy places in
Washington, but Tacoma is one that I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: like going to in Chinatown and like
Portland.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's still Oregon, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That Chinatown Portland.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been chased by a literal clan of bums
in Chinatown.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just came onto their property.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were riding those little electric
scooters that you pay for, that you rent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys want to have fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go down to Portland, rent those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just get high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can smoke a joint just like going down
the water pier down there at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's so much fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just do not go to Chinatown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not go to Chinatown.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to be on an electric
scooter getting chased by bums.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: My woman at the time, her and I were going
down to Portland.
[SPEAKER_03]: She goes, I want to see Chinatown.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go and I've been around Portland quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, you don't want to go to Chinatown.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she goes, yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, all right, fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she is so ADHD.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's just oblivious to everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were on this one corner and all of a
sudden there was a bunch of they look like
[SPEAKER_03]: heroin addicts, just like, oh,
it was horrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were definitely grouped up and doing
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she just blasts by him, just
completely oblivious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm behind her, like protecting
her ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I turn around and this guy's like,
hey, what are you doing on our turf?
[SPEAKER_03]: And him and like 15 bums just come rushing
at us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's just like, dude, oblivious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm behind her.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm catching up on this fucking
scooter.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, what's the problem?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, he didn't see the army of
fucking bums chasing us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like a scary movie beginning
for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good thing you were there to save the day,
dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like and the scooters were fast,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you had to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, for scooters, they're pretty damn
quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: They get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they're obviously a bunch of like,
I guess they're on heroin.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is a downer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe that like made them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like, you know, I mean, they were
running this fucker to bite me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what that you might turn into
a zombie for real.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Homeless people just bums are are this
generation's zombies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, out there for long enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's like, isn't that like an
episode of South Park or something?
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, it should be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I think it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it was.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so I got my first hook question for
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were to start a secret society,
what would you call it?
[SPEAKER_03]: What a secret society?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I heard the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just told you it was a hook,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got nothing, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I've never even thought about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have this dead air while we sit here
and think about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would call it octopus.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just straight up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just octopus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What would it be about?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like octopuses are so smart.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking like, is that where you're
like Hydra?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I also thought like logo later.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, I could just rip the Hydra
logo and turn it into an octopus off of
[SPEAKER_05]: like Captain America.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Octopus.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're smart.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can change colors and shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I just I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just there's nothing, man, nothing
coming to my mind like I would want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it was to be like a secret
society.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we secret?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want things to be secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe like, you know, like maybe a
secret for a good reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, what do I got to hide?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the only thing I could think of is
like a secret society of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it's a planet or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't save the planet if you know
you're out there trying to save or or like
[SPEAKER_05]: the government would like to keep it all
secret.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want people to know so they could help
me save the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's too much power for one man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it could be a big society.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could have a huge society.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it could be three people.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it could be three people in people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the letter Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it probably start with Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I got two dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both they both start with Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be like like Zantopia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zantopia.
[SPEAKER_05]: You hit me with Zantopia and I was really
expecting you to go like some like really
[SPEAKER_05]: hardcore German name that starts with a Z.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh, that sounds like a like a
scary secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was going to say we're going to
seek a society.
[SPEAKER_00]: I swear I'm not putting it in German.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a bad recipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: People be like, what the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're both originally from Washington,
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was born in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about you, Gary?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right here in Olympia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, in Olympia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go through Olympia quite often,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I'm going to be headed over
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably through there towards the end of
July.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe in November.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let us know if you're in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll smoke down or do something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, for a little while we could
actually take you to the facility and give
[SPEAKER_05]: you a little tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that'd be badass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's an interesting tattoo you have
on your eye, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Hebrew for protector of Israel.
[SPEAKER_05]: My son's name is Israel and I wanted to
get a tattoo.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he came super early.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the time I had to think and plan this
out was like cut down to like two days.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was like, oh, OK, I'm just going
to get this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had a homie who was he'd studied
Hebrew.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he was like, I think these are the
words you're going to look for.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked it up on Google and sure as shit,
they're the words that he said that they
[SPEAKER_05]: were going to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this lady who was Jewish that I
met later, she like read it and she's
[SPEAKER_05]: like, oh, that's so cute.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like no problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, OK, it doesn't say like soy
sauce or something on my arm.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted it to say, yeah, work out good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oklahoma, like right before I came to see
my son.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw this image one time it cracked me
up, but it shows all these Americans
[SPEAKER_03]: walking around with like Chinese letters
and stuff tattooed on their arm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it said, imagine if China was
like this and they just had like water
[SPEAKER_03]: written on their arm in English.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I never thought about Chinese tattoos
the same after that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much better than like.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, people do that, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: People do fucking stupid words up their
forearms or across their chest or like,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's a thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the Japanese characters.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Chinese characters.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's cool writing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you think of it in that
perspective, I'm just like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like imagine going to the country and
that's their thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get why do you have that just going to
also country?
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, seeing English letters tattooed
on half the half the tattoos would be
[SPEAKER_05]: something weird because they think it's
this, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like translates all word.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're like, why do you have that dude
on your body like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't burn door.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this means strength.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're like, no, you see it all the
time with like, I don't know, like you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: there'll be means essentially of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like clothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the clothing over there,
they'll like knock off clothing is like
[SPEAKER_00]: misinterpreted or miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I assume the same principles would
happen if you were to get a tattoo of an
[SPEAKER_00]: English word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And plus English is such a fucking hard
language to like, learn and understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so is Chinese.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, so each other trying to understand
each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the worst combo.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you any other way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need a Chinese person.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like people who are bilingual Chinese
English, they're genius.
[SPEAKER_05]: Third level.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know quite a few languages, but I'm not
fluent in like any of them except for
[SPEAKER_03]: English.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can get by with most of them if I sit
there and I listen and I take my time to
[SPEAKER_03]: speak it back and think about what I'm
saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not just like off the cusp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, I got this, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even that's impressive, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, just being able to understand and
communicate with people, like,
[SPEAKER_05]: even if it took you a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think about meeting,
you know, people from different countries
[SPEAKER_05]: here in America and like any English that
they speak.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, yeah, dude, like, I'll fucking
like, tell me, like, I want to hear what
[SPEAKER_05]: you're saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, even if it's broken and they got
a thick accent, like whatever,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to try to understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I feel like it's the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, they just appreciate that you're
trying to communicate with them in a way
[SPEAKER_05]: that they can understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like, they're like, yeah, dope.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you could learn any other language,
what would you learn?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm already kind of halfway there with
Spanish, just, you know, heritage-wise,
[SPEAKER_05]: but maybe Japanese.
[SPEAKER_05]: I watch a lot of anime, like a dumb
amount.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, I don't watch any TV period
except for anime.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, there's not another show where I'm
like, yeah, I watched that like maybe once
[SPEAKER_05]: a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll like watch a different type of show,
but like it's 90% of the time it's anime.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first instinct is just to say Russian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the only reason why is because
like, I don't know, it sounds cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar to German.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I already know a little bit of German
and have gone over and visited for a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of weeks there through an exchange
program, which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know Russian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plus I play a lot of video games and
some of those video games have a big
[SPEAKER_00]: Russian fan base, like CSGO or like Escape
from Tarkov.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, I don't know, to be able to
communicate or just like talk shit to them
[SPEAKER_00]: because they have shit to Americans in
that game.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be kind of, I don't know,
funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned the whole language just to talk
shit online.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also probably kind of like low-key useful
in the political climate right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Russian and German are two very angry
sounding languages.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_05]: German is like, it's like an ugly language
to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when I think about German,
it doesn't, it's not soft and like sweet
[SPEAKER_05]: and like sound good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like if somebody was going to yell at
me or like be mean, it would sound good in
[SPEAKER_05]: German.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if somebody wanted to like sweet talk,
sweeten up things into my ear and a
[SPEAKER_05]: whisper and they're speaking German,
I'd be like, oh, like what, what do you
[SPEAKER_05]: do?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a lot of confidence.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know any Russian at all,
but I knew a little bit of Ukrainian.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the time I did not know that there
was much of a difference, but I had a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of friends that were Russian and I
had a couple other friends that were
[SPEAKER_03]: Ukrainian.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ukrainians were the ones that were
teaching me Ukrainian, but then I would
[SPEAKER_03]: talk to my Russian friends and they would
understand what I was saying, but they
[SPEAKER_03]: look at me like, you're saying that like
all messed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, it's a Ukrainian.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, yeah, it's like slang.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's like Hispanic compared to
like true Spanish.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they understand each other,
but it's like, but people from Spain are
[SPEAKER_05]: like, yeah, on a different, on a different
level.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even like hearing them talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the like, ways that they put
accents on their word or like the way that
[SPEAKER_05]: they like to say the th sound of like with
a list, but it's like, like they're
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly spitting on yours.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, yeah, it doesn't, it doesn't
sound very good to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more akin to like that type of
Spanish though.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like how I get like French and
Italian and them being all the same thing,
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's kind of all got that same air
of whatever that Latin base.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't even ask you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked you what you were smoking on.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your favorite type of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what do you primarily go after?
[SPEAKER_00]: The, I would say like the, the necrotic
type of effect are not, not, not,
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: we just hit the second joint and it's a
different type of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really stony stuff, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the stuff they could just like,
I don't know, like, yeah, put me out,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like, or like, or so more so relax me
and not fuck with my brain functionality,
[SPEAKER_00]: not like really slow me down up top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but also just like slows my body down
because, um, and, and Josh is more so
[SPEAKER_00]: worse about this than me, but we don't
stop fidgeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just kind of ingrained.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're, if you're standing still,
like I, it just doesn't work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, to have something to slow my body
down, but like, keep my mind alert is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is always my go-to.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes, that makes three fidgeters in
the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like my wedding ring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what about you, Josh?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you into?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm like kind of on the other side
of the cusp.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like me a hybrid that's got like some
sativa effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like those are always my like go back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, Ooh, I miss that weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like today on the way home from work,
I'm like, Ooh, it's really nice outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to smoke some lemon skunk right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, fuck dude, there's,
I'm not going to be able to find that
[SPEAKER_05]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now I have to grow some and I'm like,
well, how do I get seeds?
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, like I'm like, I know skunk
is like one of those ones, like in order
[SPEAKER_05]: to get real skunk, you got to get them
from like greenhouse or something in
[SPEAKER_05]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was like, I wonder if fucking
like lemon skunk is like that,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or somebody's got them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then like, I'm not finding any
reputable sites or breeders that got lemon
[SPEAKER_05]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: And everything that I am finding is all
like sketchy and no reviews.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, yeah, just making me feel weird
about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the one country or like one out of,
I don't know, maybe 10 legal countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we were the only ones that they don't
ship to like directly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can hook you up with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need the seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like there's a bunch of other
shit I probably should grow, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: that I'm just like looking at.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I got my little collection,
but like, you know, I'm about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get you taken care.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, like those, like lemony,
like citrusy or grapefruity kind of like
[SPEAKER_05]: notes with like some funk, like some,
like, like some feet or some, some
[SPEAKER_05]: something, you know, like, or some
skunkiness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of like that contrast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the effects for me are always kind of
like, they don't mellow me out.
[SPEAKER_05]: They keep me focused.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, I like being able to like be happy
and be relaxed, but also be able to do
[SPEAKER_05]: things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I am 90% certain I have like some
undiagnosed ADD ADHD.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so like having something that like
helps me stay on target for longer than
[SPEAKER_05]: six seconds is dope.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm like, Ooh, I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That we'd good for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I can literally head down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, Ooh, I want to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like that, with that, like someone
squeezed it on top of that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: like I like those combos.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I don't like just straight up
orange, like tangy is cool, but like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it's not my thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes time it's got enough pining in
there to be different.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's almost like an orangey
haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, but like when you get that funk,
but you can, you can get a little bit of
[SPEAKER_05]: the citrus.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, this is a good combo for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think weed is situational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like you were, that you were just
asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what our favorite type is,
but yeah, I think like you were saying on
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice day like today, I wouldn't like to
just be on the couch zoned out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, I think we is definitely
situational.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of times where I fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh and I have the similar palette when
it comes to weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're generally smoking and can agree
on the same things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how this started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he's like, I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go smoke that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good smoke partner to have.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we both worked at day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would be like, Ooh, have you tried
that yet?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm like, you should, and then he'd go
get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, God damn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Garrett, uh, what about terpene
profiles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything but the Hayes terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like the Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like me, like, I don't mind the flavor,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can get down on it, but it just,
it puts my anxiety through the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you say the Hayes doesn't like me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I'll smoke that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, damn, that tastes really
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just like a refreshing pine
tree or like, you know, some Rosemary,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, not, and then my body starts to,
my heart starts beating and I,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then my brain starts focusing solely
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, Oh, that's beaten pretty
loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, then you go through this,
uh, like stair step pair down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this weird paranoia and you're
like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I even breathing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, this is weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it feels like something's in my lung.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should go to the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you don't need to go to the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really fucks with Garrett.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, almost like sometimes he's
allergic to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like he'll like sneeze and get itchy eyes
and like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm over here like, nah, this shit's
pretty cool, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's our only difference is like,
I, I'll smoke straight up sativa sativa
[SPEAKER_05]: and he's, he's got to be careful about
which one's he does.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, there's, I really, really like
hazes, but I do prefer a little bit of,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, the Indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: I say that very fucking loosely,
uh, Indica, but like more AFI bred into it
[SPEAKER_03]: where it's going to bring it a step down,
but it's still leaning towards the sativa
[SPEAKER_03]: side, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get down on the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hayes crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've gotten some lemon hazes that
have done me all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, super silver is my worst enemy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then like just classic hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not, not for me, like the old
PIFs and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't do it, but there are,
there have been crosses that, that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like, Oh, I can, I can enjoy this,
this Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, not this, not the straight
ups, not the piney and heavy, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: go getters.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been getting into growing a little
bit more of the hash cultivars just
[SPEAKER_03]: because I want to play with making my own
hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just made bubble hash for years,
pressed flower rosin, but I've never gone
[SPEAKER_03]: through pressing my bubble hash because I
covet bubble hash so much that if I have
[SPEAKER_03]: it, I just smoke it as bubble ash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I fucking love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if I had to be on a desert Island and
they said, there's only one method you can
[SPEAKER_03]: use from now on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be like, give me some fucking hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what, why I need to understand that
I've never been able to like truly ask
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody why like bubble hash or just it's
usually some old dude coming in to buy it
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was about Tinder and he would
always hit the hash and he's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, this stuff is legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've tried it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, I don't know, like in your mind,
why is that so like upper level?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always been a flower guy for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_03]: I enjoy rolling joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even when dabs came around, I didn't get
into them for a long time just because it
[SPEAKER_03]: was like, Oh, that got me high really
quick, but it takes the experience away
[SPEAKER_03]: from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're in a circle with your friends
and shit and you can sit there for,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, a half hour pass around a couple
joints or something, have these big long
[SPEAKER_03]: conversations next to, Hey, you want this
step done?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a little messy when it started
out, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like doing dabs way back in the day looked
really weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like some of the shit looked like pickles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, I don't fucking know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked like fucking drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is still kind of does like my dad
will come around and see me take a dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just like, he blows is just we want
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to answer your question, I always
appreciate joints because it had the full
[SPEAKER_03]: flavor of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I love is the flavor of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that experience with the two hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're smoking bubble hash,
it burns for quite a while and it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: thick smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing is you've isolated those
glands.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still a little bit of
contaminants, whether it's stocks or like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, small leaf matter, whatever,
depending on what you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: What grade of hash you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel like you get all the can have
cannabinoids, every bit of that plant and
[SPEAKER_03]: that flavor is just packed there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you press into hash rosin,
unless your environment's exactly,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like perfect, like you have a
cold room ready for it, a cold
[SPEAKER_03]: environment, cold storage, cold water,
everything, you know, your spatulas,
[SPEAKER_03]: everything are cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to lose terpenes through the
process, through processing it hash cures
[SPEAKER_03]: really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the oxidation.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the outside will change the color of
that and it'll make like a hard shell and
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of preserve everything that's in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that I feel I'm really interested in
making the hash rosin just because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm interested in making consistencies
like diamonds and sugar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because we blew BHO back in the day,
but that's just so fucking bad for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never get all of that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even I'm not talking shit, but even a lot
of the rec industry, I taste some of these
[SPEAKER_03]: BHOs and you go like it's dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely still in there between you're
like, yeah, there's some really good guys
[SPEAKER_03]: doing it out there, but then there's some
that you're just like, okay, you open it
[SPEAKER_03]: up and that shit's like fucking dark amber
orange and you're like fucking see the
[SPEAKER_03]: butane.
[SPEAKER_03]: And no hash was always the best for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You make me a believer, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I subscribe like you.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a good explanation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting over here like me and Josh
have ranted and raved about rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we would always, we would always talk
about rosin in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, that's just one step further
than the stuff you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you said you wanted to play around
with the hash rosin and I was just
[SPEAKER_00]: questioning you on a question I already
had the answer to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, sorry about that,
but I get it was just, it's just a
[SPEAKER_00]: different, it's just a different process,
I guess, like you don't gab the bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know, I guess maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the predecessor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, I get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like for me, it's the cocoon version.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like, it's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you like squish that into some
five star or six star or whatever,
[SPEAKER_05]: like that is the, it's the plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the essence of the plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to start paying me to do
ratings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that plan for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got my second hook question for
you guys, but I'd rather sleep wearing
[SPEAKER_03]: handcuffs or a bike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I, can I ask a question to the
question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The handcuffs in front of me are behind
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're behind you for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Behind you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he didn't say arrested, just
handcuffed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you like kinky and you got stuck
over and you're just sleeping on a bed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, Oh yeah, this is fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you're freaking out,
the bike helmet could be just as
[SPEAKER_03]: sexualized.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're behind the back.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're arrested dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That helmet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I've slept with my hands and back
for a little bit, took a little nappy nap
[SPEAKER_05]: in the back of the vehicle on the way to
where I was going.
[SPEAKER_05]: You are a very patient person.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: I leaned over.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't like on my hands and you know,
it was just a regular nap at that point.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the bike helmet would like mess
with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mess with my neck.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only way I hesitate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I'm so specific on how my pillow has
to go behind my head.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I go to sleep at night for me to like
fall asleep, but I can only imagine having
[SPEAKER_05]: this fucking thing on the top of my head
where I'm like, you just got to support
[SPEAKER_00]: the pillow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pillow didn't now goes to the neck and
now you're trying to get that right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just sounds frustrating.
[SPEAKER_05]: You move.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to wake up with a headache.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to wake up with a headache.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, wake up with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't wake up with a headache when you
sleep in the handcuffs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe your fingers hurt a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you guys had me on your podcast
the other day, I loved some of your
[SPEAKER_03]: episodes that that phenotype episode is
the first one that pops out to me as it
[SPEAKER_03]: was the most recent one I listened to.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it cracked me up how far out you guys
could go out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate you guys coming on my
show and doing this with me because we've
[SPEAKER_03]: done the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get to talk cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get to have fun, but we also get to
throw some shit out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to talk about that episode
specifically good towards the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys start getting into aliens and
shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell you what.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you each believe?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, is there life out there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thousand percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will talk with any.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will tell people I'm like, right now,
with the technology we have, you can't
[SPEAKER_05]: even kind of say no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can live in your home, hide under your
rock if you want to.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just so much evidence out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And fuck, dude, like, I don't know about
you, but it's not that hard to go see a
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking experience like, you know,
like, I think everyone's got a like I've
[SPEAKER_05]: seen that or, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what about you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude, there's this absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course, there's shit out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like they tell us like, I don't I
don't know specific numbers, but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of thousands of I don't know how
many galaxies, right, like galaxies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're in the Milky Way, right,
which is comprised of many different solar
[SPEAKER_00]: solar systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, dude, there's no fucking way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mathematically, there will not be anything
else anywhere but here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm with you a thousand percent on
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way it's just empty for just no
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even like back to your point,
[SPEAKER_05]: like, even at that level, like,
you got to believe that at some point,
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they tell us there's Earth like
planets out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, well, then, yeah, I saw this
statistic that was like just in our like
[SPEAKER_03]: galaxy Hubble telescope alone has already
noticed quite a few planets that have
[SPEAKER_03]: potentially have water, which is the basis
of life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the way that I see about it is
if we already perceive this and we know
[SPEAKER_03]: that there's a few plants out there that
could potentially have life within the
[SPEAKER_03]: vision of the entire universe that we can
see, which is way beyond our reach,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is like this much.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot what they named it, but there's a
brand new telescope that's even more
[SPEAKER_03]: powerful than the Hubble was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're getting way better pictures
with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just imagine if we find even more of
these exactly like you said, if there's
[SPEAKER_03]: not like a fucking Amoeba or a protozoa on
that, is that not an alien?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, so at some level, like we went,
like there's aliens and I'm safe bet that
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could put your money there and be all
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not talking the aliens in the
movies.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, like, no, but like, if you guys,
if you're trying to ask me, like,
[SPEAKER_05]: how I really feel.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything that you've been riddle me
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have so many alien things come out
like in that as of late and like that now
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like second nature now should come
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm from a different planet, superheroes,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's, it's just okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's accepted, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I feel like that's like slow roll,
like desensitization.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that when they tell you there's aliens,
it doesn't melt your brain out of your
[SPEAKER_05]: face.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you don't just go into a panic and
start lighting your pants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we've already been visited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like ain't no way, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just watched this, like an hour long
documentary on mummies in the grand
[SPEAKER_05]: Canyon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I I'm convinced there's like a sphinx
or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, there's so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, I'm not going to go into it
because it's so long, but like on you look
[SPEAKER_05]: this up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it was an incredible source,
there's multiple different videos on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the credible source is this place
exists.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was these things found there.
[SPEAKER_05]: What the source is.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the debatable.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the one guy I watched was very
convincing and already kind of like was
[SPEAKER_05]: explaining things along the lines that
like, I'm making sense of aliens in my
[SPEAKER_05]: head.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm like, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: This could be some more, some that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I'll give you the link
after this, but yeah, you get into it and
[SPEAKER_05]: there's gotta be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like also, like, why does the pyramid look
like the one in the Aztecs app?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, why does the Egypt one and Aztec one
look the same?
[SPEAKER_05]: They've never seen each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not homies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not kicking it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not taking boats over.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't consult and be like,
Hey, this is really good shape.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were blessed with secret knowledge.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were both made with shit that we
can't even understand how they made it to
[SPEAKER_05]: this day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like, I don't know, maybe mammoths.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Peruvian temples alone, seeing some
of the structures of how they put those
[SPEAKER_03]: blocks together, where it's almost like a
puzzle piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: But those ones are like on my peaks of
like these cliffs, because I like how
[SPEAKER_05]: crazy the rain comes down.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like so much erosion that there's
only so many spots you can build and
[SPEAKER_05]: everything else around.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a fucking Valley, like in a river.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's just rivers everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like, yeah, to move all these rocks
with like, you got canoes and you,
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even think they had horses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't even think that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very obsessed with Egyptian culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know very much about Peruvian.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm like, did they even have animals
that could pull that shit?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like maybe an ox or like an alpaca.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like, how many alpacas would it take
to move one of them fucking stones,
dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some beasted alpaca.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, there's no way even that we're the
most advanced, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's not even close.
[SPEAKER_00]: If everything's infinite, dude,
like there's you just got to believe that
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like technology wise, we're on a very slow
roll until very recently to like something
[SPEAKER_05]: to think about.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the best Wi-Fi password name that
you've ever seen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Steiner hat password or or the Wi-Fi name?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is kind of an old meme,
but like I like the like police van ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: When when people I think that kind of
started this whole revolution of like the
[SPEAKER_00]: antithesis of I like that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw, like, get your own fucking Wi-Fi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I forget the name of the guy,
but it was like directly pointed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I assumed like a roommate, but it could
have been a fucking neighbor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could have been like, hey, dude,
get your own shit, like, get off my shit
[SPEAKER_05]: as the apartments.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, who would be just putting
them on blast every time I try to sign
[SPEAKER_05]: into something.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see this right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, just everyone knows it was very good
service if you don't change your Wi-Fi
[SPEAKER_03]: name to something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to fuck with my neighbors,
so I named my Wi-Fi after him with his
[SPEAKER_03]: name drawn out in an exclamation point at
the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time he gets on it, it says his
name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know they already know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys are doing this podcast and
you're going you're talking you're you've
[SPEAKER_03]: evolved more into talking more about
cannabis specifics a little bit and you
[SPEAKER_03]: guys as work in the rec industry,
I've noticed, especially you guys are
[SPEAKER_03]: monetizing now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have your own discord, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will put that link down here in the
description.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys enjoy Josh and Garrett on the
show, you can go check out their discord.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in there, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're sharing a ton of information,
not just on the podcast alone,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you have grow threads and you're
helping people with grow problems and
[SPEAKER_03]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, our best.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys ever do like live shows or
anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's things we're thinking about,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to the future, we want to make sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, so we did like a live for 20
giveaway thing for like an hour or like 45
[SPEAKER_05]: minutes or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like, but hockey came on and he's our
homie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been on a couple of episodes and he's
our very first ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very first ever patron.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we like this guy a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he came and kicked it with us,
but like nobody else jumped in or asked
[SPEAKER_05]: questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, man, I was really
expecting this to pop off.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think I would do a live show when we
were like maybe double digit K and
[SPEAKER_00]: followers are like, you know, like that
was just Instagram live too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's merit for going on to
like something like Twitch and doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: show like that and potential to have a
bigger audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just kind of like a thrown
together thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it wasn't really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super well thought out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say no at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but there's definitely eventually
going to have some live shows,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether that be just for patrons or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we're still kind of toying with the
idea of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, cause we like to give back to the
homies in there who like to support us.
So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you're, you're following and the
people that follow you are really
[SPEAKER_03]: ultimately going to be the people that
truly support.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to see you doing better and push
you to be better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you guys, it is so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Much better going slow and building up
your community with those people that you
[SPEAKER_03]: really vibe with, because in the end,
you're going to be a lot happier than
[SPEAKER_03]: having, you know, 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen a million videos, uh,
from creator friends of mine that said the
[SPEAKER_03]: worst thing that ever happened to me was a
video going viral.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, why is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if your video goes viral,
everybody knows you for that one video and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're all following you, but it's not
people that are interested in you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just like that video.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing, not all of your content.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get this huge influx and followers and
then they're not liking your content.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not sharing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're ultimately doing yourself a
disservice because a bunch of people are
[SPEAKER_03]: leaning, seeing your stuff and yeah,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to call them, uh, nameless numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never get to know their name,
but they're just a number.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really important to get those
people that you know, you're vibing with
[SPEAKER_03]: and that you have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys are fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can already tell I'm going to get along
great.
[SPEAKER_03]: With you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're definitely going to have to do
more of these episodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, for sure, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've wanted like you're in Washington.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would like to have like a live like
together episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we go over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can come over here or whatever,
but yeah, like there's no reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have another microphone, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We have another microphone.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can bring all three of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it don't matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys, are you monetizing on a
Patreon at all?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have like what are $5 slots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, they used to be three.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a few packs from our homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did an episode with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he sent over a big old care package,
uh, one each for me and Josh, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: some extras just to do whatever we wanted
to do with give away anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided that we would put it on for
our Patreon, you know, as like an
[SPEAKER_00]: incentive to you get some like legendary
seats for $3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just a no brainer and it's like,
um, incentive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, four 20 rolled around and we
had some, we hadn't met our, we had 10
[SPEAKER_00]: packs to give away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to about seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had three left to give away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did that on four 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just kind of like a, a blessing
the people kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so then we just moved our tier
to, uh, tier to tier two, which we still
[SPEAKER_00]: have, uh, free seeds on there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, some sweet tea seeds from,
we got a pack of sub cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a couple of miles out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did ourselves a breeding project with
those and they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: A decent amount of variability in there,
but there's still like a pretty,
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty small gap of different phenotypes
that you can get out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been a couple of people who
have random here and there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you wanted to, I haven't grown any
myself, so, um, I just kind of gave them
[SPEAKER_00]: out to some people and they grew them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but that's on our, on our tier now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also produce some extra
content on our Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just for like the, uh, we go over very
specific topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's more geared toward like a new
grower, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a very educational.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a 20, 30 minute, like hard focus
on like IPM or pH or, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: soil types or, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are Patreon exclusive podcast
episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I appreciate you guys coming on and
taking your time to join me for the smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: session.
