[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, everybody, and welcome to
another episode of the Calix and Crude
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get started, I want to give a
quick shout out to Coconut Sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coconut Sensors has one of the best
sensors on the market right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a retail value of only, what,
$69, you can pick up a sensor that checks
[SPEAKER_00]: your humidity, your temperature,
your VPD, and I heard from Anton coming
[SPEAKER_00]: here soon, is also going to include not
only the charts for the live VPD,
[SPEAKER_00]: but CO2 as well, which is very,
very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's episode, I'm highly stoked for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been anticipating this for a very
long time, very long overdue.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just did a podcast with the James Loud
Show, Romulan Jake of Romulan Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's everybody doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an awesome day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We finally got some heat over here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a little bit warmed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rolled up some sour diesel for this,
and I just wanted to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've been talking about doing
something like this for a very long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: and today is the right day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we get started, not all of my
listeners are going to know who Romulan
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics is and the story behind Romulan
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you introduce yourself really
quick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell everybody who you are, what you do,
what your company is about, and what your
[SPEAKER_00]: goal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to remember all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name's Jake.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the owner of Romulan Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find us on romulangenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got an Instagram under the same name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been around and breeding for going on
two or three years now, if I forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2015, my father passed away,
and as part of him passing away,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Romulan clone that was kept in our
family, which wasn't known as Romulan by
[SPEAKER_02]: our family, but was handed over to me,
and it was kind of the fortress passed,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was told to keep it alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do well with it, and I started by
giving clones and cuts away for a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time, and then eventually people just kept
pressuring me, you know, hey, you got to
[SPEAKER_02]: make seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to do some stuff, and so I started
doing it just as a hobby, and I got such
[SPEAKER_02]: great positive reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turned into far more than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of become a life-calling passion
more than a hobby now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really stoned right now, so I'm going
to try to try to remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember you said my goals, and then
there was something in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something in between that maybe I missed
there, but as far as future goals,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a small little roadmap plan that
I've been sticking to for the past few
[SPEAKER_02]: years of things that I, you know,
right when I kind of set my mind that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to do this and do Romulan genetics,
I came up with a bunch of stuff that I
[SPEAKER_02]: knew I wanted to breed it with,
that I knew I wanted to try and see what
[SPEAKER_02]: it would come out like, and then I had
some other things that were personal
[SPEAKER_02]: projects that I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've been sticking to that roadmap,
and I've got, I don't know, about another
[SPEAKER_02]: two or three years left of that,
and I figure once I get done doing that,
[SPEAKER_02]: it has a lot to do with making as many reg
seed lines as I can, along with a few
[SPEAKER_02]: feminized versions in between to kind of
keep people happy that allow them to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my plan is with the reg seed stuff is
to get a decent stable for me to work from
[SPEAKER_02]: so that over the next 10 years and a
couple years from now, I can start
[SPEAKER_02]: stabilizing those lines, the ones that I
like the most, do some things where I,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, phenol hunt and find some really
nice unique ones and make feminized
[SPEAKER_02]: versions of those for people, but try to
eventually get to where I've got about
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe a dozen IVL versions are close to
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's my long, long-term goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's stuff that will, you know,
we're talking at least 10 years beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: that for me to just get a few things
available at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome though, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got plans already to take what your
father bestowed upon you and put your own
[SPEAKER_00]: signature on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take a step back really quick
because you just said something that I
[SPEAKER_00]: hadn't heard from you before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that your family didn't know it
as Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was just basically, because back in
the day, there weren't really,
[SPEAKER_02]: when I was growing up and this was in the
seventies and the eighties, you didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really have as many names for Bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really about the location where it
was from, you know, there was Maui Waui
[SPEAKER_02]: and a few exceptions, but for the most
part you were talking about, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol or gold or Columbia and red.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was called red because the hairs
were red or gold because the hairs were
[SPEAKER_02]: golden where it came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was called pine bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a mountain nearby where I
grew up called pine mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some people would call it pine
mountain, but people that were close to my
[SPEAKER_02]: father would call it G-dubs bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were the initials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was mainly because it smelled like
pine and nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people just referred to it as the
pine bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome, man, because that's
exactly how I came to know it before the
[SPEAKER_00]: name Romulan came by was Port Alberni
pine, but that's what we always write.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I, when I, when I first got into
this, I didn't know about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was stuff that I had to learn early
on getting into this and talking to
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, you know, there's a much
deeper history than what you can kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: just look into on the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I started talking to my,
my pops friend that was, that hadn't
[SPEAKER_02]: passed yet and getting more information
from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and that was where I learned a lot
more about, about all of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause initially it was just that,
wow, I know this plant's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave it to some friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the word coming back was,
I mean, it's, it's a lot more than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people don't really have this anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to try to get it to as many
people as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it went from just a, it did,
you know, it went from this really kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: small thing, like, you know, no big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm sure I can keep it alive,
you know, and I've got, I've got my dad's
[SPEAKER_02]: friend that I, at the time he was still
alive and I, you know, I can talk to him
[SPEAKER_02]: and he can tell me what to do if I've got
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was real, you know, carefree,
you know, and I remember my first harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: and I just was floored at how good it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, okay, this is,
I'm going to keep doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of what I've wanted to do my
whole life is have my own grow that no one
[SPEAKER_02]: fucked with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I can definitely do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as soon as I started giving some
of the flower to friends, then people
[SPEAKER_02]: started asking me for the cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started giving that to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, months down the road,
they were coming back to me saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can't just keep this to yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to, you have to get this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the burden really kind of got heavy at
that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I knew that wasn't something I was
prepared or wanted to do or capable of at
[SPEAKER_02]: all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started just giving it away to
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was on forums and eventually people
said, Oh, you don't go on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got on Instagram and was trying to
find, you know, people that wanted it,
[SPEAKER_02]: that had the biggest grows that I could
find on there, you know, pick out her
[SPEAKER_02]: grows and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people that were in California as
local to me as I could find.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I eventually got to give it to darker
nursery and I gifted it to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of had this fantasy that,
you know, it's only going to take them a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of months and they're going to be
clones are going to be everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was years later before they even
did their initial release.
[SPEAKER_02]: During that time, I had people asking,
you know, can I get seeds from you?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, I have some old ones,
but I don't, I don't really want to give
[SPEAKER_02]: them away.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all I have from my dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it doesn't go well with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: How old was he when he passed that cut to
you?
[SPEAKER_02]: This was in 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am near 15 now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was, it wasn't that long ago when he
actually passed it to me, but I grew up
[SPEAKER_02]: around it and I was, I can literally
remember in my diapers around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was, it was around before I was
born.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you said it was a long-term project
between a lot of guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did you have any growing experience
prior to your dad giving you this cut?
[SPEAKER_02]: I had not all on my own.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had grown up around growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cultivating and I'd helped a lot of
friends do things, various different
[SPEAKER_02]: grows, outdoor closets, all that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many, many times, but I had never,
it was never my grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was never from beginning to end.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one else was doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always just kind of, I'm coming
over to a friend's house and we're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: this together at best, or it was,
I'm giving him advice, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it wasn't really ever my grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, it, there were several where I was
involved enough where it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is our spot and everything,
you know, we were saying how we grew this,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was never my own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it never felt like I knew what I was
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was such a burden then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I had a decent amount of
knowledge and I had a lot of access to
[SPEAKER_02]: everything I needed to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the time I knew enough to get
started, but that was about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're kind of down the line for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did an awesome job at preserving those
genetics, I guess say, and now you're
[SPEAKER_00]: hybridizing all these things to find new
things to hunt through, to kind of take
[SPEAKER_00]: that Romulan staple and put your own
signature moves on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to say that Fritter bomb that you
made recently, if you would have caught me
[SPEAKER_00]: any other time, I would have just called
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like with a lot of cookie stuff,
I usually call it bullshit, but we do our
[SPEAKER_00]: hype strain reviews and on our hype strain
reviews, we did smoke that apple fritter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was one of maybe three of the
hype strains that I've ever smoked that I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, that one's actually really
decent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, lump, that's lumpies who made
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's pretty local to me here too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, that one was special to me that
Katsu chose that because it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a guy that's, you know, I don't know
him personally, but he's not far from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think he created that in 2010 or
2012.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been around here for a long time and
it's just now starting to become the big
[SPEAKER_02]: hype thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been really cool to watch that
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that one was really special to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was fingers crossed that that was
going to turn out good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it blew my mind how good it actually
turned out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've smoked apple fritter,
you know, it's, it's pretty potent stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the two of them together is it's a,
it's real good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the taste is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people that are kind of
church chasers and then the flavors are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to love it just because of that,
but because it's so potent and so strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did it change the flavor profile?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not exactly the same as it smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of things don't,
but it, it's got a real good sweetness to
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of the best way I can
describe the smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause for me, I have a harder time kind of
pointing down flavors than I do smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like smoking a sweet candy
that's got some kind of cushy piney ganja
[SPEAKER_02]: type, you know, flavor in the background
too, but it really, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's almost like smoking candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's I'm trying not to dip back into it
and smoke some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when I get stuff that's that
tasty, I also smoke an ounce every few
[SPEAKER_02]: days and I can't stop like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's too bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Preserve it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just be sitting on my couch like a
zombie 24 seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me ask you, when you were looking
at putting your own signature on this and
[SPEAKER_00]: finding things that you were going to
breed with the Romulan, what were the
[SPEAKER_00]: boxes that you had?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what were you looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: What were you looking for?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that one's really easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want Romulan that tastes different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be able to have some options to
smoke different tastes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke it all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke it every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been smoking it for years straight
and I never tire of it, but it's nice to
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke stuff that tastes a little
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, most of the stuff that I go out
and get, or I get from friends or I grow
[SPEAKER_02]: myself, that is a totally different
profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really like smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the taste of it, but 10 minutes
after I smoke it, I'll go and smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: Romulan because that's the high that I
want to feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to feel whatever it was that
I just smoked.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the first category of that is
make a bunch of things, or try to at
[SPEAKER_02]: least, that affect me just like Romulan
does, but have a different taste to it,
[SPEAKER_02]: different smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I want to have, after that,
I want to have things that are far more
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa leaning or far more indica leaning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to have stuff that's better for if
I just want to zonk the hell out or watch
[SPEAKER_02]: a movie or be really couch locked or stuff
where I want to be almost like I'm on
[SPEAKER_02]: amphetamines or something, cleaning my
house, mowing my lawn and doing
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to have that broad spectrum because
I like everything that there is within the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis world for smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first is flavors and trying to
stick with stuff that hits me just like
[SPEAKER_02]: Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the second is stuff that's close
to the Romulan effect that I can get,
[SPEAKER_02]: but leads far more in one direction than
the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this is why you and I have always got
along is because you're very fucking real
[SPEAKER_00]: with what you say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not trying to promote yourself out
of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just telling it how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that you're working with
Romulan in this way, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that you love to smoke and you
want to take that to different lengths
[SPEAKER_00]: that are still going to work good for you
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that you're breeding for what
you like and you're actually putting that
[SPEAKER_00]: intent in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to come forward in your
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I go through so many seeds all
the fucking time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got so many friends that do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot everything that you had to
crossed the Romulan with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What all did you pick other than the apple
fritter?
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the cats to collab, that's he he
made those selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was all his choices.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he may have tried to choose things
that he knew I would be interested in,
[SPEAKER_02]: like too, because he did make a lot of
selections right up my alley.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, several of two or three of
the things that he crossed with,
[SPEAKER_02]: he didn't know what I was doing at the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we made the exact same crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: We both made a roadkill skunk and Romulan
cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: We both made a great vape and Romulan
cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was one, I think one other thing
that we both did the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on one or two of them, I think the
great vape, we were using the same cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were literally making the same cross
the roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hunted mine from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I got from copycat, which was,
I know some people have issues with that
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't really give a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some people I highly respect said,
it doesn't matter what you hear about him.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to grow something of his
and you like the old school shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: get his roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a guy that's been growing
for 30 or 40 years that told me that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then someone else repeated it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't have quite as much credit in my
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was, yeah, I heard it from several
people and I went, okay, I'm going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was legit and it was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I found one that was the one that I
chose was not quite the skunkiest.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't the best selection in that
area, but it had a really nice structure,
[SPEAKER_02]: had a really massive yield to it compared
to the other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it didn't have as much of a branching
issue or anything that needed support.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was my question because it was
a real nice reader.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't going after it just for the skunk
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate strong branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to spend too much time in the
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want a good structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like if all the progeny, you know,
they're either weak and limpy or strong,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't really mind too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes it a lot less work when
you've got something that yields a really
[SPEAKER_00]: nice, that's not flopping all over its
fucking self and needs to be managed on a
[SPEAKER_00]: daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't help because of my personality
with being kind of OCD with my growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I'm doing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm in there almost every,
when I'm breeding, I'm in there every day,
[SPEAKER_02]: checking every single plant, looking,
trying to literally with my eyeballs and
[SPEAKER_02]: hands, look at every node, every portion
of it and going over the whole plant to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure nothing's going wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing's, you know, and if you trellis
things and have all kinds of supporting,
[SPEAKER_02]: that gets to be a huge pain in the ass to
even get in and prune and trim and things
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't stand the fact when my Romula
cut is, it's a pain in the ass in that,
[SPEAKER_02]: in that sense, you have to support it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to trellis it in almost every
type of growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a lot of work in that sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to, when I'm breeding with it,
I already know that that's an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to choose things that are going
to not continue that as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what you want to do is,
you know, with every out-crossing that you
[SPEAKER_00]: do, you want to take what you already had
and make it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point isn't to go backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that you're breeding for those
weaknesses within it, that really shows
[SPEAKER_00]: your passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a learning process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of thought getting into all
this breeding stuff, I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there'll be some, some failures.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure I've heard that, you know,
but I figure probably most of the stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause if I choose right, most stuff I make
will be, will be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's been like maybe a third,
30%, 25% of what I've made has been,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, now this actually is stuff that I
can, I can sell to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take a short break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will be right back with Romulan
Jake of Romulan Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, while we're on short break,
I wanted to give a quick shout out to one
[SPEAKER_00]: of my favorite sponsors, one of the best
affiliates that we have on the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: Coconut sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can find them over on IG over at
coconut Inc, or you can find their website
[SPEAKER_00]: at www.coconut.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's K O K O N A U T dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe their sensors retail at $69
each.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's such a cool little device guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot praise them enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use them in all of my rooms,
especially at that price.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really beat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are battery operated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The batteries have never ran out on me and
I've been using them for over a year now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe I heard that the batteries can
last in them for up to two and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: years, but that comes with the price
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: What coconut does, it's pretty amazing
little device.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get an app that works with it on
Google play.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it on the Apple store,
but what it does is it connects your
[SPEAKER_00]: climate data to your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can tell what's going on in your
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to go away for a while,
if you need to take a vacation,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, you know what's going on inside
your grow room and it'll help you keep
[SPEAKER_00]: track of keeping everything where it needs
to be within VPD values is pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tracks it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bump it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can refresh it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty handy little tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add multiple sensors on the same
app.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can check your bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check your clones, your ceilings,
your mothers, your flower room,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome retail value.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot say enough good things about
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard they're also going to be
incorporating CO2 as well soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very much looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that it's a great device.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a bit higher price,
but not much, not much at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the CO2, I believe he said it was
going to be running a higher power.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is actually going to have to use a
wall plug on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, we love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We support them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the best sensors for one,
the best price points.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys aren't looking to go out there
and spend $300 on a sensor, but you do
[SPEAKER_00]: want to keep control of your, of your
climate in different grow rooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would highly suggest coconut sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go give them a follow over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's coconut.com one more time,
www.coconut.com, or you can find them on
[SPEAKER_00]: IG at coconut Inc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's get it back to our episode with
Romulan genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're back with Romulan genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we left, we were talking about some
of the people that you were collabing
[SPEAKER_00]: with, like Katsu.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did the release with Katsu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you thinking about collabing
with?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked to quite a few people and I've
for a while since I started this,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a short specific list of people
that I wanted to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Katsu was on that list before him and I
even talked to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was really excited to work with him
and that's turned out to be pretty amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: because you know, I see what most breeders
do with a collab and they make maybe one
[SPEAKER_02]: or two strains and that's their
collaboration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they move on with their lives to
other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what Katsu and I were going to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it ended up trending.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turning into really big projects and
ongoing and years worth of releases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking about doing more things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's, it's almost becoming more of
a, a long-term partnership and a
[SPEAKER_02]: collaboration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he knows a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm learning a lot from it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And getting to see crosses with stuff that
I've wanted to see for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just went and did it and got it
done and I get to see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did that with him and I'm talking
with 13 Hills.
[SPEAKER_02]: And UFO genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think those might be the next ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know exactly if both of them are
going to happen or what's going to happen
[SPEAKER_02]: with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we didn't get too deep into
specifics with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been a little while since I
talked to UFO genetics, but I recently got
[SPEAKER_02]: my cut into Paul's hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the guy who runs Nucleus Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's a really good friends with the
guy from 13 Hills and the guy from UFO
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's going to try to then get my cut
into their hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they're, and so those should be the
next two people that I'll be doing one
[SPEAKER_02]: with hopefully if things go well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked extensively to Gage Green
Group and it's been about a year since
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked to them and we never really
got into specifics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard that name for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've just kind of just kind of been
quiet for a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully that means they're hard at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've talked to them several times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked to Ethos a little bit and both of
them and I think that's it as far as like
[SPEAKER_02]: what will actually happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: There've been several other contacts from,
from other people that things probably
[SPEAKER_02]: won't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I just, you can only do so many
things at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't fight too many wars on different
fronts, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some people can just, you know,
but I don't, I'm not the kind of person
[SPEAKER_02]: that will ever, I'll never be dropping two
or three new strains every couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll, I'll never do that, you know,
on a consistent basis for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people drop things like that and
that's, that's not how I work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like smaller batches just so I can
really pay attention to those few,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I take on too many projects and
your mind starts going all over the place
[SPEAKER_00]: and it becomes a little bit fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually try to stick to one or two and
that's how I've done most things in the
[SPEAKER_02]: past.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just recently bumped it up and did like
a, five different crosses at once and red
[SPEAKER_02]: feet stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a little bit too much for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I probably won't do that that many
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it gets too hectic having, having to
pay as close attention as I do to all the
[SPEAKER_02]: different plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they're all different,
that's harder to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of have to like go row to row
type thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times my plants will get
mixed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll be like, look, trying to look at
the tag tick with the same hole to work or
[SPEAKER_02]: till I get through them and then move to
another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then that gets too hard to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I hear that man.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out of all these collabs that you did
with Katsu, what would you say were the
[SPEAKER_00]: top three that you personally,
you were like, I really appreciate this
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did the first one was a year ago and
it was a feminized seed line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he did basically about the same thing
that we did with this current release
[SPEAKER_02]: coming up with the regular seed line.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did like a dozen different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: He reversed my Romulan and let that dust
all these, these things he'd been growing
[SPEAKER_02]: for a while and working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And several of those, he, we hardly got
any seeds from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't get very much at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were, oh, it was only enough
from two of them to release in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we released old school bank,
which is kind of like white Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the white Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we were released.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we released a space field,
which is East coast tower, East of Lynn
[SPEAKER_02]: Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And both of those were top notch,
just fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we didn't have that many packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have that many feeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty limited release.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have several packs of myself,
but I kept them evolve.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff was really, really good,
but there were 10 other cultivars that no
[SPEAKER_02]: one really got to see or smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think only a few testers got some
stuff from Katsu and most of them were
[SPEAKER_02]: fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a black blind Bubba Kush in
Romulan that was about the most potent
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff I've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it would like, felt like I got hit
in the head with a prime pan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I would just basically pass out
10 minutes after I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a bad thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, it's not a good thing really.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't sound like it's a pure alley.
[SPEAKER_02]: For special occasions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I guess if you, if you get home
from a hard day's work or something,
[SPEAKER_02]: then that's exactly what you're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was, it was just remarkable in how
potent it was and its taste was really
[SPEAKER_02]: good too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there were several of those things on
the regular seed thing that I just test
[SPEAKER_02]: ran and I'm smoking all the stuff of it
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and there's a few, there's two that
haven't quite finished up their long
[SPEAKER_02]: winded 12 plus weekers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm waiting for those before I can talk
about those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fritter bomb is probably for
what's going on in the industry right now
[SPEAKER_02]: is probably the best one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be what I would pick the number
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm trying to appease everyone with my
selection, it's not my own personal number
[SPEAKER_02]: one, but it's the easiest to grow just
about the highest yielder in that room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ran 12 different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really, really high yields,
a really pretty plant, really frost
[SPEAKER_02]: covered, really potent, really tasty,
you know, just kind of crossed all the
[SPEAKER_02]: different boxes off that people look for
these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked really exotic and shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one was probably the number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two for me is vapor trails,
which is the road stunk in Romulan because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's got that old school flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's extremely potent on the end of
the side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't smoke a lot of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Harder and to push it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's I just try to have stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only smoke it at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it just doesn't feel like I'm
smoking that much of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause all day long I'm smoking Romulan
from about an hour after I wake up until I
[SPEAKER_02]: go to bed and it's sometimes I'll smoke a
bowl every 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice smoke a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I smoke a lot, a hell of a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, sometimes I feel like I have to
cause I have so much weed on me that I
[SPEAKER_02]: have to keep smoking that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause otherwise, you know, what the hell
am I going to do with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's eventually going to go bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I was going to say something
there, but I can't put a marker there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, vapor trails number two and
probably the stocks, which is UW in
[SPEAKER_02]: Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be my number three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's cause I, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because my choices are kind of
going to be a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the head dip is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's headband in Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all of them are really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all so good that it's kind of hard
to really choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so most of them, it's like,
well, this is a lot like that parent or
[SPEAKER_02]: this parent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it doesn't impress me as much as
the ones that are very unique in their own
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones that came out much more like a
true F1 are the ones that I've got my eye
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, wow, those are special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause when you look at both parents,
they're coming out as pretty evenly as
[SPEAKER_02]: something in between a mesh of the two and
quite unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Stonks is really, really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saying that F1, the blend between
both parents is very dominant in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes over the leaners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas some of most of the other stuff,
it was that things were in one direction
[SPEAKER_02]: or the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: There really wasn't as many phenols that
showed up that were in between,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it was a really nice mixture of
the two parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them were that you can tell that
leans more towards Romulan or you can tell
[SPEAKER_02]: that lean leans more towards that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just as an example, that's not a good
example.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Stonks one was really interesting
because there was this really off smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: plant that finished really fast and I got
to smoke it early on and it tasted exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: like great blunt wraps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like really strongly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you smoked a bowl of it and a
glass piece, it did this really strange
[SPEAKER_02]: thing with your head where you're like,
am I smoking blunt wraps?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't understand what's going on
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people in the room too, like I had the
first bowl I smoked, I blew out and
[SPEAKER_02]: someone walked in the room and they're
like, are you smoking blunt wraps in here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has a different perception of
what something tastes or smells like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is interesting to see because I do get
some people that have grown my Romulan cut
[SPEAKER_02]: and specifically my cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got it from Dark Heart Nursery and
every now and then I get someone that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're like, oh, it tastes, you know,
creamy vanilla.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something totally different than what
everyone else tastes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, I'm like, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see a picture of the girl and they
show me a picture and it looks fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, they must just have kind of
like a different, you know, profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way that their body takes it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I remember when I did my first and it
was, it was horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have a handout right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, nobody gave me any cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I had, I had to work from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the very first cross I did,
I just was not happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time we got to F3, it just wasn't
stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had, I think I saw you talking
about that, but we had all the testers
[SPEAKER_00]: growing them out and it was very heavy on
the skunk side of its family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the testers, by the time we came
to harvest, they were saying, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really, really earthy, skunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it was, there was something like sweet,
skunky phenotypes, but everything was like
[SPEAKER_00]: overall very skunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a little bit of Hawaiian in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd get that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had one tester that said,
it tastes like mint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, is it dry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just totally off the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It throws you off too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, you went pretty far off
the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One guy had me hunting for like a Sino
that I wasn't going to find in mine for a
[SPEAKER_02]: while.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got talking about, we got talking about
something else and he goes, he goes,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, this tastes like this to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's everyone's smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't, it wasn't OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't OG, but it was something like
that where everyone universally says this
[SPEAKER_02]: is what it tastes like, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, nah, no, it's totally
different for me, but I'm like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: With so many, with so many strains and so
many things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how long were you hunting for that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: It had been like, uh, I was probably three
grows for like nine months.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made a cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the first early things I did and I
never released it was the hog with
[SPEAKER_02]: Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really, really good, but it had a
very high intersex rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like 30% somewhere around there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I couldn't release it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was trying to hunt through it and
find better things, but I'd had people
[SPEAKER_02]: that had done, did test grows and they
were like, no herms, fucking crazy yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the biggest I've ever seen and super
potent, super potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the best stuff I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one guy, cause I, I wanted to call it
alien bacon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I realized I was going to cross them,
I just kind of had that name stuck in my
[SPEAKER_02]: brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one guy said, no shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a phenol that tastes like bacon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I got to find that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking for this bacon, you know,
and it was, there was no bacon phenols to
[SPEAKER_02]: be found.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't anything close to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I kept looking though thinking,
yeah, you're looking for that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who doesn't like bacon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody loves bacon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not everybody, I guess,
but yeah, I've got to be the PC one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to put another marker now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's probably countries where they
don't even know bacon enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should have a bacon across the world
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start and it'll give out bacon to
underprivileged bacon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to cut that one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm enjoying this, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said it was going to be a session
smoke and be relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what I'm being.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there anything else that you wanted
to talk about on the show?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to like force your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't, I don't know quantum
physics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you, what do you want to talk
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, now I kind of want to talk
about quantum physics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got some shit or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, I can go pretty deep in a
lot of different areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done, I've done a lot of reading and
stuff throughout my life and, and my
[SPEAKER_02]: beliefs are very, let me start with what I
believe in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I believe that I'm a Christian and I
believe that most of what's written in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Bible, all that what's written in the
Bible is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of it is interpreted truly is the
best way to explain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't want me to have a podcast
today, but no, no, no, no, listen,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is, this is, this is important and
you can air any of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: I studied Orthodox Christianity and what,
what I was taught by the people who was
[SPEAKER_02]: teaching me in Orthodox Christianity,
which is an older form of Christianity is
[SPEAKER_02]: that there is room within Christianity and
believing in God and all of that for big
[SPEAKER_02]: foots, ghosts, aliens, wormholes,
portals, time travel, anything,
[SPEAKER_02]: anything, because God created everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as humans, we shouldn't question what
was created.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should examine it and do our best to
interpret it and all these things,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we should not ignore it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should not deny it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we should not question it because if
he created it, it's not our job to
question it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should not question what he's made.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was one of the first meetings I
had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was kind of something I was being
forced into.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going into a marriage and they said,
you have to be Orthodox Christian.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was going into it a little hesitantly
and I asked him these questions and I
[SPEAKER_02]: said, what about these things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I've read the Bible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe a lot of it, but there are
some issues I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I explained my issues and he said,
well, most people look at that the wrong
[SPEAKER_02]: way because they don't realize with God,
there is no time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of what you're reading that's
being explained is time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It isn't time how we see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's how he sees it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe a day is a million years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's a billion years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's like, a lot of people don't
realize that in reading it and they,
[SPEAKER_02]: they misinterpret things and they take it
the wrong way and they take it too
[SPEAKER_02]: literally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have spent my whole life studying all
these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I firmly believe I've seen UFOs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had very dramatic Bigfoot encounters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a Bigfoot encounter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had one throw back at me on my property
rock back at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not joking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm dead serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where it was in Bigfoot country,
I haven't seen where people would have
[SPEAKER_02]: been.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no other explanation that I can
plausibly come up with because it wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: people I was dealing with that were in the
forest next to my property.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dog was going nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dog that doesn't bark at people ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never loses his mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was going ape shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was something moving in the
bushes about five feet from my fence and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a fence.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is wrought iron.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can feed through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I couldn't see what the hell was
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then something else moved 15 feet away
to the right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then something else moved way over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I knew it there was now I'm dealing
with multiple things because that one
[SPEAKER_02]: thing didn't move.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still there making noise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I started talking and thinking it
was people and I got no response,
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm armed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I pick up a rock and I throw it
high arc up in the air to try to have it
[SPEAKER_02]: land behind whatever is out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll hopefully get them to at least make a
movement so I can better know where
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever's out there where it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as the rock landed a rock hit
right next to me, there's a huge pine tree
[SPEAKER_02]: that's like a kilo.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't even put your arms around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big around a big rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit the tree right next to my head about
16 inches, 18 inches from my head and
[SPEAKER_02]: bounced off the tree right behind me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost hit me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it happened.
Bigfoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only thing I can come up with
because I turned on the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: After that, at that point, I really kind
of got scared shitless.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started trying to flashlights and
spotlights and there was nothing there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not it's hard for me to explain,
but it's not a place where people would
[SPEAKER_02]: be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could possibly be, but it's not a place
where people would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they certainly wouldn't be there at
two o'clock in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: A group of them without flashlights,
without anything and able to move from the
[SPEAKER_02]: area without making as much noise as
there's all kinds of sticks and branches
[SPEAKER_02]: and whatever was there moved away
silently.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just wasn't there anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard very minimal movement that I knew
it was moving and then it just wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to explain it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was either a ghost that threw a rock at
me and many of them that were just fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: with me and my dog could see him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it made the whole property smell weird
or it was Bigfoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I just love how like dead on serious
you are right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it was Bigfoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had other people here that was that was
witness to it with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, don't let me be all you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everybody has fucking encounters
of some kind or like I'm just the worst
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking skeptic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably because you and I both
have that OCD problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I'm the worst skeptic ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to explain everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get that because I've been down that
road the opposite way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I've had I've seen pans fly
across rooms for just all kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a long story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to tell you about that
sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually went to college at what had
been recreated from a old mental hospital
[SPEAKER_00]: and they turned into a college and there
was some crazy shit that happened there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even Missy, like she loves ghosts and
she's like, and you don't believe in
[SPEAKER_00]: ghosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, a ghost would literally have
to walk up to me and say, what up?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'd be like, all right,
you're real.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there is shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like there's no explaining
that, you know, like seeing a knife go off
[SPEAKER_00]: a three foot counter through my body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you don't have enough velocity to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you've seen something like that,
it's you're like, you know, OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do I explain that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, we talk about cannabis
sometimes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me ask you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what happens when the weed you're
smoking is too good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way off track.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least it means we're smoking good stuff
because you and I are both in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just by far one of my favorite
podcasts I've ever done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we're sitting on opposite
couches in the same room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's how it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I've always done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even back on when we did like all the IG
live shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just sitting there smoking,
talking about weed with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should always be like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it flows.
[SPEAKER_02]: It reminds me of, you know, younger days
just going over to friend's house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just friends coming over to your house
just to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you'd sit there for hours,
playing low in the background,
[SPEAKER_02]: just chatting, laughing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm shooting about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did want to ask you one question that
we always ask all of our all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one I'm super interested in
because there's a few options now from
[SPEAKER_00]: what you've said that you have to pick
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we always say if there is one,
I don't like to say strain anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate saying strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been saying type, cultivar,
type variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think cultivar more as like not a
type.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find a type is more like your
Fritterbaum, Fritterbaum crossed with
[SPEAKER_00]: Romulan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your cut would be the cultivar.
Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I question myself all the
fucking time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get tech to go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's spot on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to ask people, you know,
out of everything that you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that you work with,
if there was one type to represent your
[SPEAKER_00]: company and what your goals are,
what would you say it was?
[SPEAKER_00]: One to represent Romulan genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tough questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I could obviously just be easily
say, well, Romulan, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're putting your own signature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm torn between, I'm torn between two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is communion that I made and I made a
rig seed and a feminized version of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I ever released the rig seed
version, but that's, I want to work that
[SPEAKER_02]: further or do any releases of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that one was really, really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put a lot of work into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started by crossing two other things
first and working those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then cross that with Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a great Stumper OG and Durbin
Poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm remembering right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go reading my website or something
right now going, no, it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a bad memory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I liked both of those and I was
excited just to cross those two together
[SPEAKER_02]: for some structural things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to see if I could bring over that
the trichome production of, and the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the bud sites and stuff from, from Grape
Stomper into the Durbin Poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's just a corpse plant to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about that flavor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Love the flavor too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, anything that's, anything that's
older is just right up my alley.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, basically if you get to,
if you go through the history of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: once you get the headband, that's kind of
where I started checking out on these
[SPEAKER_02]: things taste great to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything after that just wasn't as good
as the older shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was so between, between,
between the communion, which was that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that came out with a really good grape
candy or wine kind of flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just delicious, really,
really potent, but a nice, like you can
[SPEAKER_02]: chill on it and, you know, relax the
Indica high, but it wasn't like going to
[SPEAKER_02]: put you to sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I spent a lot of times listening to
albums and stuff, smoking that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tore through, I think I had like a
half pound of it and I smoked it in a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of weeks or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a stupid short amount of time
that I smoked all this weed to my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that one was really great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the first thing that I made,
it ended up, it started as a poly hybrid
[SPEAKER_02]: project and ended up being a double poly
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made called it ring of fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have a nice release and I did an
F1 release.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one probably best represent
stands for who I am and what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, yeah, I'm going to work that
further and release a, like an F4,
[SPEAKER_02]: F5.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I get antsy, if I don't get antsy and I
can be patient, it'll be an IBL by the
[SPEAKER_02]: time I release again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But who knows how long that could take me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there can be setbacks and all that
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that one, I think best represents me
because of the fact that that's the first
[SPEAKER_02]: real thing that I made.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I set out to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ended up with a double poly hybrid,
which if you know about breeding those,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's far more complicated, far more
complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more things you do when you're doing
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, it was all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had so many clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know what the hell to do with
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: At one point I was, I mean, I was jam
packed and that was how I wanted to start
[SPEAKER_02]: learning to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was to try to get the most difficult
stuff out of the way first, so that
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else wouldn't be a challenge in
a sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would, it would be enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, I'm really proud of that creation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was something I spent a lot of time on
and I didn't, I was like a secret.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't tell anyone for a long,
long time what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I finally released that,
I kind of did it all without much notice
[SPEAKER_02]: when I first dropped it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did like a real limited release at first
and gave it out to a bunch of people as
[SPEAKER_02]: testers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one, I think best represents what I
do and what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you've grown it and smoked it,
the feedback I've got from everyone is
[SPEAKER_02]: they absolutely love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people that have keepers
they found and that's what they continue
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a really, really good smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a really, really, really good
smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I know I'm like sitting here and
I'm kind of getting some of that I can
[SPEAKER_02]: see, but I think that's probably the one
that the best represents me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Communion, I would say also is there
because a lot of the stuff that I will be
[SPEAKER_02]: doing, not so much as a personal project
for me is going to be like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stuff that I try to appease people
with is going to be more like community.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stuff that what I want is going to be
more like Ring of Fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be stuff that may be unruly
to trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be a pain in the ass to grow,
but I'm not going to care about that
[SPEAKER_02]: because my ultimate, I can grow something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I care about how it smokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing else matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care what color the leaves turn.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: They trim off anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I only care about what it
smokes like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ring of Fire was, it was Benaki.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was pain in the ass to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was a super pain in the ass to trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there were leaves and frost
everywhere, but the smoke made it all
[SPEAKER_02]: worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but I do try to do a lot of stuff
because I have people that are close to
[SPEAKER_02]: me, friends and stuff that say,
you know, Hey, when you cross these,
[SPEAKER_02]: will you do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are some things that I'm choosing
and working things through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made a Mac one and the runs crossed with
Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I crossed the Mac one and the runs
together first and worked those and made a
[SPEAKER_02]: selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I crossed with my Romulan and I'm
calling it Burning Cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a strain that I'm probably
going to be releasing somewhere within six
[SPEAKER_02]: months from now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did that project solely because I
had pressure from like three close friends
[SPEAKER_02]: to work with those two cultivars and work
it with Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And two different people were
specifically, one was asking for Mac,
[SPEAKER_02]: one was asking for runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make them both happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll start by crossing those together
and then I'll cross that with Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it turned out pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it turned out pretty good,
but I never would have done that at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it wasn't for people asking me,
and if it wasn't for some of my followers
[SPEAKER_02]: saying, you know, Hey, I would love to see
a run from Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are some things that I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's so it never would have seen a
lot of day.
[SPEAKER_02]: People wouldn't even know about it if I
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all that matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of stuff I've scratched
that, you know, like for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't like it when I crossed just
Romulan with Mac one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that might turn out okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I thought it would look good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you did try it out across the both
parents too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plant sucked and the smoke sucked
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, I would be saying the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If those people who could be offended were
in the same room and you'd be staying in
[SPEAKER_02]: front of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can respect brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a lot easier when it's that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, when someone gets
offended, you can explain yourself and be
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you don't apologize and all that if
you can't fix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't want to make your day harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been, I've been dealing with that
long enough now where it doesn't really
[SPEAKER_02]: trouble me as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when it comes to time and I
still don't want to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The offending people drama thing has gone
very well for me lately when it's
[SPEAKER_02]: happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a dojo seed stone ninja.
[SPEAKER_02]: He put a post up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were like, Oh my God, coming at me,
talking all this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell is going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, you can't call this
strange cold stone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he did made a strain in the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't know about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just put a post up and he wasn't
trying to start shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He even said that in his post,
but it, it, his followers blew up on him
[SPEAKER_02]: and I got all his fat clash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then I'm like, Hey, Hey brother,
I sent him a DM and we just start chatting
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything was totally cool right off
the bat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was a great guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, we'll just change the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't, you know, it's months from
release doesn't even have a date yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, cool, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can keep the name if you want
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really even care.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was super chill and everything
worked out fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just changed the name and there was
like no drama, but for a couple of days on
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram, it was, you would have thought,
you know, someone's grandmother.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's end this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to end this?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for coming and joining
me on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you haven't done very many of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really like speaking publicly or
anything like that, but I hope this really
[SPEAKER_00]: helped you break out of your shell because
you and I have been talking for a while
[SPEAKER_00]: now, especially about doing something like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy as hell that you finally came
out and that you were able to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, talk about this because your
story is special, you know, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that needs to be out there,
especially just you as a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect you as a fucking person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't say that about very many
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for having me on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you and I kind of talked about
maybe doing something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as it's not immediately,
I'm definitely down to do this again soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just need to, like I said, I need to
touch up on my sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: What an amazing episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you all enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jake is always a great person to talk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and I always click and it's just,
it's a never ending source of
[SPEAKER_00]: entertainment talking to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we look forward to having him on the
show again soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get going, I wanted to give a
quick shout out to our Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only $10 a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gives you all access pass to our discord
and it gives you write-ups as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: learning how to grow with KNF.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am merely your guide in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to teach you how to grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that people need to
realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are the one that's going to teach you
how to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am simply there as a helping hand to
help guide you and whatever style of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing you decide is best for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have write-ups consistently on how
to use a KNF, how to slowly incorporate it
[SPEAKER_00]: into your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in transitioning into
those methods, all kinds of great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to give a shout out to all my

[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are all joining me on the brand
new discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're learning all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're wondering if it's worth it,
go give them a follow on IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask them what they think of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a great, great community and we've
been having tons of fun over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all kinds of threads anywhere from
a general chat, soil building,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, making different teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a suggestion box.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can tell us what you want to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we've got the show off threads,
joints, dab art, all kinds of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We even have home gardening threads,
a place to promote yourself, to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, to talk about harvesting,
plant training, IPM, making your own
