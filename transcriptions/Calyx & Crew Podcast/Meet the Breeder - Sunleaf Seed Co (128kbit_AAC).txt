[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, everybody, and welcome to
another exciting episode of the Calyx and
[SPEAKER_00]: Crew podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get started, don't forget to
follow us on Patreon over at Doc Calyx.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got plenty of entertainment,
game shows, giveaways, and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also get to meet with these breeders,
question them, whoever we have as guests
[SPEAKER_00]: on our podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to invite over to our Discord so
you can go ask them one-on-one questions
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to, and you get tons of other
goodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a great experience overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get started, I want to give a
huge shout out to Stoner Days Apparel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can go over to shop.stonerdays
.com, use code CALYX, that's all caps,
[SPEAKER_00]: C-A-L-Y-X at checkout to get a whopping
20% off your order.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very excited about today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Sunleaf on the other line.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to be talking about some of the
methods that he uses to repopulate land
[SPEAKER_00]: races.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to talk about that Sinai that I
grew, that beautiful Egyptian land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about replicating
environments with some of these land
[SPEAKER_00]: races, as well as Sunleaf's intuition of
getting into growing, what got him into
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, and where he sees Sunleaf Seed
Company going in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate having him on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got him on the other line right now,
so let's just jump into the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunleaf, how you doing, my brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we really get deep into things,
I wanted to reiterate for people that may
[SPEAKER_00]: not be acquainted with Sunleaf Seed
Company, who are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you from?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you all about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're based out of Colorado,
primarily, right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done a lot of multi-state work over
the past few years, but what we're all
[SPEAKER_01]: about is breeding seeds for everybody,
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to encompass the market,
being able to have high CBD seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are strains that will be good for
people who aren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: With some of these new states coming up,
you don't have people who are wanting to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke 30% THC strains, so we have some
stuff that would be considered missed,
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as the market would go,
as far as THC testing, but people still
[SPEAKER_01]: really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have those really great
high-testing THC strains and land race
[SPEAKER_01]: strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those ones we really hold dear because of
preservation as the legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: They become more prevalent.
[SPEAKER_01]: These kind of old strains that have been
the backbone to all of our creations can
[SPEAKER_01]: get lost with all the pollination and huge
hemp fields, actually, that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: authorized to grow in our whole country
and other countries as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really been one of those rushes to
people preserving the airlift.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a lot of what we do is
preservation, preservation breeding,
[SPEAKER_03]: and breeding hybrids that mainly breed
hybrids, I like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: In turn, a lot of other people like to
smoke, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of where we're at with our
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to make some content, but I don't
want other than auto-fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't really done that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you mentioning that because a
lot of people don't mention that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about land races a lot on my show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about land races a lot on the live
shows as well, but one of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't get brought up very often is why
it's important to preserve these genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are going away, that there is
climate and environmental factors that are
[SPEAKER_00]: eroding and taking away some of these
populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The potential for them to be watered down
or get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_03]: These farmers don't have a lot of money
for these areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're making seeds for their next season
consistently, so pollination contaminated
[SPEAKER_03]: a crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be a devastating thing and it
will forever change the variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that we feel is important,
but also it's really great for people to
[SPEAKER_03]: play with, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not all what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't strictly do preservation
efforts, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do like to make polyhybrids and
modern-style hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your goal with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: High THC and the effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, we're breeding for when you're
breeding for production, which is what I
[SPEAKER_03]: would consider modern-day flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people want them in their skin to
yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all secondhand things I
consider.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I want to breed for yield and
quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of given that when we're working
these modern lines, the goals we're trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to achieve is high THC, bag of steel,
yield, these are all things that benefit
[SPEAKER_03]: the farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another thing that's secondhand.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all about the farmers, the growers,
and really trying to elevate strains to
[SPEAKER_03]: the point where if you've ever grown some
of these varieties that have been hyped
[SPEAKER_03]: up, you'd be like, oh, yeah, it's really
great, but it doesn't yield very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't do a whole garden of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the kind of things we're trying
to do with our breeding and bring up
[SPEAKER_03]: spring lines up to production lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are you preserving some of these
land races, but you're trying to work them
[SPEAKER_00]: into modern hybrids so people get what
they want out of what they see,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the more modern cultivars,
but incorporating the medicinal benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: of those land races into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We work quite a few projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do have lots of F1 hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would call them very similar to two F1s
where you're taking two inbred lines and
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding them together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's probably very uniform.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what you'll find with our direct land
race hybrids, they're very, very uniform,
[SPEAKER_03]: just like an F1 would be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these ones, you're going to find the
most medicinal properties.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll find some lean towards the land
race, some lean towards the modern
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivar, because typically I like to
cross them to a modern cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that really kind of helps out that
modern cultivar gene pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you can do is work that line and
go through and select through inbreeding
[SPEAKER_03]: towards whatever you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's very medicinal.
[SPEAKER_03]: These strains that we're working that are
land race hybrids, they're very medicinal
[SPEAKER_03]: properties.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have very high CHP,
most of them, but they're really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really great for breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will take qualities that you don't
see in the modern cultivars, like pest
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance and mildew and mold resistance,
and really be able to bump that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a stepping stone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the work we're doing is creating
stepping stones, cutting out some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: work that you don't have to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so you can pick up where we started
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's another one of our goals,
is get people into breeding their own
[SPEAKER_03]: seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And using tools like land race genetics to
be able to help them breed stuff that
[SPEAKER_03]: isn't going to be successful for them,
for whatever their goal might be,
[SPEAKER_03]: making an auto flower or maybe making
something more medicinal, that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a couple different styles of
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do the strictly land race breeding
where we're preserving a land race.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do the land race hybridization where
we're using most modern cultivars with the
[SPEAKER_03]: land race.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm doing the normal style
breeding where we're doing polyhybrids to
[SPEAKER_03]: polyhybrids, modern cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these lines I've worked quite
extensively, and then I'll talk them to
[SPEAKER_03]: the modern cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll see in some of our seeds that
it really brings up the yields and size of
[SPEAKER_03]: the cyclones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really like a guided work on some
of these lines to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really respect you for doing that
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I like to ask all my
guests, especially my guests that are
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders, is out of all the work that
you've ever done, what types have you made
[SPEAKER_02]: that you say represent your work the best?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have to say some of the stuff that
I don't consistently grow, but it would be
[SPEAKER_03]: the land race hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because it seems like people get so
much joy out of growing them, and it makes
[SPEAKER_03]: me feel good that I made them to make
other people happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just the fact that they're so unique,
and you don't see a lot of people doing
[SPEAKER_03]: that these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of those land race hybrids,
which one of them do you say is your
[SPEAKER_03]: favorite?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're all unique in their own way.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, each one has its own
different quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's so special about these
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Lebanese is going to be so CBD-rich.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got very, I wouldn't say very low,
but moderately low QC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even in some of the phenotypes that
you can find, these are really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you go over just a little bit to
the Egyptian, and all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no CBD nearly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's much higher CAC, and it's all
bred for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to tell you, that makes me really,
really happy, because that Sinai just got
[SPEAKER_00]: done carrying up, and we were going to
smoke some of it for the first time this
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, it should do a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can arrange that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say what the effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know if I've talked to you
the last time about the effect,
[SPEAKER_03]: or you might have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main reason I was chasing that Sinai
was for that granule terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking through different cultivars
that were high in the granule,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Sinai popped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I saw that you had it,
and I was like, well, hell, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: hunt these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and did you get any terpene tested?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not get them tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I test with my nose because I am a home
hoppy roe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can say they all had a very,
very granule smell to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had heavy, heavy floral rose scents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fairly inbred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them, some of them had like a
musky, skunky spiciness to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they all seemed to carry that floral
scent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one that really, really stuck
out to me, and I did a small pollination
[SPEAKER_00]: on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it definitely carried what I would say
was a peach essence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I was stoked to not only
keep those seeds around and go through
[SPEAKER_00]: them, but go through those peach rec
crosses that you sent me with the Sinai.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, you're going to like those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking on those peach rec real quick,
those are probably the peachiest terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of the market right now, if anybody goes
out and grabs any of the peach stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: or if you're into peaches, if you can find
my peach cobbler or the violet peach,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to say I have one for
someone, but it's probably the most unique
[SPEAKER_03]: peach terp I've ever worked with.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like nothing else.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all coming off of that peach rec.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Sinai, that's exactly how I would
describe the terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely reminiscent of stone
fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can sum it up to that, like the
apricot, mango, peach, like stone fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally apricot, just like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what I was speaking on that is how
unique they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go from one location to the next.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's totally different.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Pakistani that I have is very,
I want to say, burning tires and earthy,
[SPEAKER_03]: burning tires, patchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very much for PhD development.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like for getting stone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of these are like different tools
that people can use and access.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was one of the reasons that we
put our seeds, our land rights packs,
[SPEAKER_03]: at 24 packs, 24 seeds per pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get enough to play with because
you'll find some, you might find some auto
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that can, that diverges into the way
that we do the breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not doing any sort of inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're selecting one male and one female.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm leaving the population very open so
that you can see what they were working
[SPEAKER_03]: with over in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll have all that genetic
information to be able to pull from.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll find some that might have an auto
flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll find some that might be stretchier,
might be more vigorous or less leafy,
[SPEAKER_03]: leaf to cowlick ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we tried to leave everything in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously we pulled anything out that
had undesirable traits like from after
[SPEAKER_03]: disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can only do so much when we're
talking about growing something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is another thing that I've
noticed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about something that grows
where they're putting very little inputs
[SPEAKER_03]: into the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you take it and you give it everything
it needs or everything we think it needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's way too much for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is one of those things where you do
have to spread widely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't treat it like a modern cultivar,
pound a bunch of food into it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I have to be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are trying to remove problematic
genotype, genotype when they arrive.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we can only do so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you do have to take things like,
I would say like with a grain of salt kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of where you definitely don't need to use
as much food and inputs as you would
[SPEAKER_00]: normally.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's one of the things about
replicating the environments of these
[SPEAKER_00]: heirlooms is you're trying to replicate in
a way their environment because you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: treat them like modern polyhybrids,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them like it a little bit drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them like it a little bit wetter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them don't like any nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're used to growing up in sandy soil
while others are used to growing in very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very nutrient rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen this, you know, you can take
some of these and grow them in different
[SPEAKER_03]: environments.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen people take the Pakistani and
grow it blind and do actually do injury
[SPEAKER_03]: projects with it where they've been
selecting the male and female that do the
[SPEAKER_03]: best for four seasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now everything that comes out of that
is really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's climatized.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still Pakistani, but it's in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's lots of work that people can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, the main thing is that we
were just trying to make access for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to lay claim to any of
these.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was the land races.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to give people access in
North America.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was our original idea with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's give access.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's order a bunch from overseas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get them from private collectors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do repopulation of moderate size,
you know, 25 plus males and females and
[SPEAKER_03]: make them available in North America
because one of the worst things and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, biggest decision, seed buying is
that having to order from overseas is
[SPEAKER_03]: always a drag.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might lose your, you know,
your order to custom.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was the whole thing is we wanted
to eliminate that, that whole barrier.
[SPEAKER_04]: That whole process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give Americans and people in North America
access to land races without having to
[SPEAKER_03]: order from overseas and wait two or three
weeks to get them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that was the whole idea of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was just access, genetic
access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we respect that because I can tell you
firsthand that I've had, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of packages that have been
intercepted, you know, and then you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get your seeds and there goes your money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and that's the other thing
too is where you have orders from overseas
[SPEAKER_03]: and sometimes those seed banks will,
will give you a refund or they'll re-send
[SPEAKER_03]: them, but they might not be the same
piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's always a risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always a risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was one of the things that we
wanted to give people access.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we thought that was really important,
genetic information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say that was a big push of what
got you into breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: No?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it that got you into breeding
first?
[SPEAKER_03]: What got me into breeding was,
um, just that there was nothing that,
[SPEAKER_03]: there wasn't a lot of stuff in North
America.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the time that we were, you know,
growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, uh, what you could find was very
limited and it wasn't always very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we did order from overseas,
you know, it's always a risk, like we were
[SPEAKER_03]: just saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the reason that we started breeding was
because there was just not very good
[SPEAKER_03]: access to stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our idea was to just start breeding on
our own for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we did for several years,
actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, we started growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started growing in 2008.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we didn't start breeding, um,
until 2011.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually was working with a partner,
um, and met him in about 2010.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were growing together.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started breeding in 2011.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, the reason we started breeding
was just to make our own seed because we
[SPEAKER_03]: were just dissatisfied with everything we
were getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was kind of the first,
the idea of preserving stuff came later,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, after we had decided like,
let's incorporate some land races into our
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's incorporate some stability back into
these lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's when we started to order stuff,
you know, from overseas, Middle East,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, collectors from India,
wherever we can find collectors who were,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, able to travel at that,
at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to think back, you know,
people were able to travel after we did
[SPEAKER_03]: just for a whole year, but, um,
we would get them from collectors from
[SPEAKER_03]: different areas or a seed bank,
seed bank from different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before all of this, you were still in
Colorado when you began growing for the
[SPEAKER_03]: first time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a lifetime.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, um, Oregon is another state that we
associate with pretty heavily.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, um, actually you'll, you're going
to see us pop up there a lot more in 2021.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, um, I do have growing experience
in Southern Oregon where we're growing
[SPEAKER_03]: outside in 200 gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the climate there is very
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: People think of Oregon as being like rainy
and humid all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where we're at Southern Oregon is dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Eastern and Western Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never really been to Washington other
than Seattle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Direct opposite of Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sagebrush and cactuses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, um, I've got a few little
like experience growing in a few,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, obviously, you know, when you're
inside, you can control your environment,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, much easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but even, even depending on where
you're at, you know, you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: different, there's going to be different
pressures that you have when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: setting up a new environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, just, um, yeah, we've got
multi-state experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, and, you know, it's continually
expanding as we, uh, as legalization is
[SPEAKER_03]: going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you say is the number one
strain that you sell out of the fastest?
[SPEAKER_03]: The number one?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say I
have a number one strain that sells out
[SPEAKER_03]: the fastest, but I do have some stuff that
seems to really hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all seems to be whatever the flavor is
that year.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, banana seems to be really
popular right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a lot of people picking up the
raspberry banana, you know, an all time
[SPEAKER_03]: favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically, um, everybody unanimously seems
to like the coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so we did a little bit of work with
Kaya's coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I would just say it really depends on
whatever is popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to breathe, you know,
not just what I like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll throw some, some stuff in there that
I don't necessarily like the most,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, because a lot of the other
people like to smoke, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: some of them like top standard,
which is a, a surfing that I'm not super
[SPEAKER_03]: fond of, like jelly beans and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And tangerine flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm not really fond of it,
but it's really, really popular for other
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I make tea for people, so I got to make
what they like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the strains that really brought
Sunleaf Seed Company to my attention that
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard a ton of people raving about was
the Unleaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's, what's that all about?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Unleaded is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a ice cream very fresh from our Black
Top and the Black Top is the sour,
[SPEAKER_03]: diesel, Nigerian bread.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is really the, yeah, the Black
Top is really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Black Top is actually a strain that I
acquired from other breeders in Oregon
[SPEAKER_03]: who, um, they, we traded it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and yeah, the funny story on the Black
Top really quick is actually I went to one
[SPEAKER_03]: of these, um, home growers in Oregon,
um, dispensaries were there, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: home growers were there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody was there handing out flowers to
each other trying to flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, basically like this was, somebody gave
me a couple of buds of this and it had 10
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds, 15 seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, it was the best flower that I
ever had, um, like out of everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was black and red.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guy, the guy was like,
oh, we're calling it, we call it Black
[SPEAKER_03]: Top.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, cause it's like asphalt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, it had been bred for
several seasons with the selection being
[SPEAKER_03]: for sour flavor with the Nigerian fuzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a very cool head effect like,
um, and so we grew it out and we continued
[SPEAKER_03]: to work with it and everything that it
touches seems to bump up the resin head
[SPEAKER_03]: size, bump up the yield from top to
bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it adds a sour flavor and it'll add
that uplifting the Kiva fuzz to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of overpowered stuff,
but it leaves, it leaves really good trace
[SPEAKER_03]: of the mumps.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, and like, like I said,
it bumps up the yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we thought back to the ice cream
cake, it was just quitting out stuff that
[SPEAKER_03]: was like coke bottles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I handed out a few of them to a
few people and some people got some good
[SPEAKER_03]: pictures of them, but, uh, that's the main
thing is like that's going around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's going to be a big one once
more people get to see it, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: build the soil too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take a quick break.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be right back with Sunleaf Seed
Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are back with Sunleaf Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we left, we were talking about some
of his methods with three repopulating
[SPEAKER_00]: these land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the cultivars that he works with,
not only is he doing preservation efforts,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he's working on true hybrids and he's
working on poly hybrids as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also doing a lot of fem work now,
and we're going to jump into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be talking about how he
feminizes seeds, what he's been working
[SPEAKER_00]: on, what's to come with suddenly seed
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first we went through and we dug out
our peach fino of the cyanide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been saying that wrong forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cyanide, cyanide, cyanide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to nail that in my head,
but we found the peach fino.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some loaded up and we're going to
do a live review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll talk about the effect real
quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to go through a portal.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the effect is very similar from what
I've reviewed, similar to like headband
[SPEAKER_01]: almost where you'll feel it kind of in
your forehead, almost like your third eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, really, really weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that the flavor isn't
overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not it's not watered down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a very, very it's not an
offensive one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't stick out, you know,
but it's a very, very clean, very even.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is it's just a fresh, clean flavor,
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, and that's one of the
things like some of us younger people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The major prohibition, you know,
we're so spoiled, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can smoke some of these land races to
where they you know, they kind of taste
[SPEAKER_01]: like grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's always disappointing to grow it
for eight or nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so yeah, that one is really
that's a really good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of want this ones that are going to
be that you're going to want to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell it's something that's not
going to knock you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, flavor it will see effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a little bit, but flavor right off the
bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean burn, beautiful, smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that floral really came
through, and that's kind of what's leaning
[SPEAKER_00]: into that clean taste is kind of that
floral essence to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one that it's light and it's
nice on your palate, too, where you can
[SPEAKER_03]: taste it after a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, it's not getting super hashy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not overloaded with resin to be able
to get too hashy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great hybrid, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm excited that you made some.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually I did the open pollination of
the phenotypes that I like the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, what I was seeing in that
cyanide population, it is very inbred.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of variation,
but there was some that were taller with
[SPEAKER_00]: longer inter nodal spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was some that were really
like you said, it was a pretty rare
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype, but there was some more broadly
dominant plants that stayed shorter in
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was one select female that peach
one that was that broadly dominant,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what I was going after.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first, it expressed a very,
very dark colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the male expressed really dark colors
in the sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that female, especially amongst the
land race population, it was frosty as
[SPEAKER_00]: hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, but it was putting off
that peach flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, you're you're the
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's just that obvious, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hit the male with her and I kept a
couple other females and hit them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mainly wanted to select from that
one plant and see what we can get out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was going to take those
probably make another selection and then
[SPEAKER_00]: out cross from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But last time I talked to you,
you said it actually took a couple out
[SPEAKER_00]: crossings before you started reaching
what's considered a more modernly
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable plant structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably experienced that some of
these land race flower density isn't going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be the same as we're used to with the
modern cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you might find that you do need to
take it a few generations with a modern
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivar or using very aggressive
selection for dense flowers, if that's
[SPEAKER_03]: what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the least of my concern.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people aren't concerned about
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The main thing I think that this is
greatly used for is the terpene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The terpene flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the goal right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually crossed it to some Afghani work
that I did with one of my aliens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's called the Afghani Alien.
[SPEAKER_03]: I crossed it to my Afghani Alien.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it puts up massive nuts, like two
liter bottles almost.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they take like 13 weeks to finish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's unbelievable how big you get.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is like one of these receptive
states where it's like you don't see these
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of phenotypes and genotypes within
either one of those populations until we
[SPEAKER_03]: out cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is a really great strain to be
working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy that you're messing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you already I'm already feeling
the effects of it, which is actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: little surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is selected as a drug cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it would be considered in the
Middle East as a drug cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the tests actually are over 16
to 19%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those tests were actually done in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: In southern Oregon on a farm that we were
not working on, but we were working with
[SPEAKER_03]: the farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was all the same seed stock and
everything that we had worked with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's all really accurate information
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all that generations of farm
work on location before it was even handed
[SPEAKER_00]: to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or who was it, Red Scare, before you?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was Real Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already feeling it in my arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: My arms feel very, very that almost that
tingly feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can definitely feel it in my head,
like you said, almost like a headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's hitting me more like a one to one
where it's very, very easy and very
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not overwhelming at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't say trace elements,
trace amounts, but 1% or 3% CBD in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can contain some other.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the word on this for it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It might contain some other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canapnoids?
[SPEAKER_03]: Canapnoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might contain some other canapnoids
than those two even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually pretty common amongst land
races.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the testing got done, I shouldn't say
we did the testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the testing got done, I think it was
2016.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's been a whole load of canapnoids
that have been discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty amazing, especially when we
came from THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've got CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got, you know, even THC and
CBD, we're going, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's why you got to heat it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a topic that we just need to put a
whole episode on THC, awesomeing,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really like watching your live on
Instagram where you guys were just like
[SPEAKER_01]: every, every episode you guys were going
over like different types of terpene or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpene Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool to see how much stuff has been
coming out and every time they discover
[SPEAKER_03]: something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a lot coming from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we get too off subject,
I, we want to go over like what Sunleaf is
[SPEAKER_00]: doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing with your company now?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the future of Sunleaf seed company?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen you're doing a lot more
feminized work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now we're not, we're still going
to continue to go and raise work and
[SPEAKER_03]: preservation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that's never, that's never going to
stop for us, but we are doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: feminized work and, um, with modern folk
arts for the main, main portion of this
[SPEAKER_03]: work that we're starting right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out of these feminized genetics that
you're starting to work with, what are you
[SPEAKER_00]: putting out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you excited about?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's in, what do people have to expect
in the future coming from Sunleaf?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the main thing that we were,
you know, the main thing with the feminize
[SPEAKER_03]: is that, you know, people find it really
convenient.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of where the market is heading,
but as a breeder, um, you can really dial
[SPEAKER_03]: in what's happening, what, where your
problem is going with the line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is something that you can't,
you can do with the male when you're,
[SPEAKER_03]: when you do rigorous tests, you know,
not that we're not doing testing,
[SPEAKER_03]: but when you can really see what the
phenotype and the Dino, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: assume the Dino type of the female,
um, you don't have to deal with something
[SPEAKER_03]: that's unknown.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you kind of have a little more guided
breeding when we're doing feminize
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so look for, it's one point two,
we're going to be doing pretty much only
[SPEAKER_03]: working with all breeding techniques,
um, all feminize lines to really,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, give people, uh, more options for
feminize feed, but also to try and win
[SPEAKER_03]: more people over towards the feminize feed
because there's a huge misconception that
[SPEAKER_03]: feminize feed is, um, unstable,
uh, I was going to ask you about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, if what you're doing,
you're making it correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're, you know, it's usually not
unstable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't had any, I haven't had any,
um, um, and even some of the feminize feed
[SPEAKER_03]: that I've been running from other breeders
that have just started making it through
[SPEAKER_03]: to me, um, has been really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the techniques have really come a long
way from what we were using even two years
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, you know, the idea is to really
get people on board with this is where the
[SPEAKER_03]: market's going and not that we're going to
stop making regulars, but when you can
[SPEAKER_03]: eliminate, uh, variables, you know,
when, when you want to directly stabilize
[SPEAKER_03]: the line or make something that,
uh, isn't going to have a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity or variation, um, without doing
years and years of stem breeding and work,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, you know, feminize is just the way to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's absolutely a place for feminize
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, my first argument would be
these states that have plant count limits
[SPEAKER_00]: and people don't want to get in any
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to know that they're going to
have what they want coming out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: seat, or at least as long as that's from a
reputable breeder, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: not only that, if you have no interest in
breeding at all, um, feminize might just
[SPEAKER_00]: be for you, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people, you know,
you know, some people go, think about
[SPEAKER_03]: other people being limited on space.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, even me, sometimes I take the
idea that someone might be limited on
[SPEAKER_03]: space for granted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So being able to opt three seeds and know
that they're going to get three females is
[SPEAKER_03]: much better for them than opting six seeds
and they don't know if they're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: get three females.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't know if they're going to get
two and they don't know if they're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to get six.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know if they're going to get
12.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have too, where you, you know,
you overpop thinking that you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get males and then you get all females and
you go, Oh no, that's an awesome problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say I've ever had that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea is to be able to, you need to
go to Vegas and gamble right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the idea is to be able to get people
more accustomed to be comfortable growing
[SPEAKER_03]: a feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: There really isn't, if you do all the
research, you'll find that the breeding is
[SPEAKER_03]: basically the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just making females instead of
putting other variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people argue that it's
unnatural.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're just countering nature
and how can you create a good product from
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's so unnatural to the
plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would, I would really disagree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we are using a chemical to change the
hormonal production of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but the actual physical pollinating,
it's still natural and the seed production
[SPEAKER_03]: is natural and the chromosomes are all
natural.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just females.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I encourage people to do more research
on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and I think you'll find, you know,
when we're talking about humans,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, so much different things,
you know, but when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: plants, they're much different and it's
actually extremely common in nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and this kind of breeding is
extremely common in the agriculture
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one thing that the animal
industry has not caught up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to add to that, I would say that I have
grown quite a few fem seeds and I've never
[SPEAKER_00]: had a problem with any of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, thankfully, hopefully it was good
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I got lucky, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've had not only good results with
fems, I've never had an intersex fem seed
[SPEAKER_00]: and I have had some really, really good
yielders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one that was an amnesia haze fem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that was even from Barney's
farm and it did excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like an eight ounce plant,
you know, in a, in a square meter,
[SPEAKER_00]: no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, this is one of the things
that we're doing and you can do with them
[SPEAKER_03]: and I see that we can really dial,
uh, trace that we want to lock in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's just easier to do because we can
see the female and we can see what this
[SPEAKER_03]: female will put into a line with this
other female.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we reverse one on the other and
yeah, it has variables between,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, strains that you're talking to,
but, um, it's much more reliable than to
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to, you know, see what you're
doing, what you're working with than using
[SPEAKER_03]: a male and guessing, you know,
and yeah, there's testing that you can do
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of different kinds of
testing that we can get done.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're talking about,
um, the males, you know, uh, these guys
[SPEAKER_03]: throwing a hundred males and throwing out
selections, um, you still have variables
[SPEAKER_03]: that you can't see in those males that
when you, when you make your, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, crosses, uh, these variables can come
out, you know, um, and this is just
[SPEAKER_03]: something that we were trying to
eliminate.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to stay on par with the rest
of the agriculture, uh, industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, um, if you've done any research,
you'll see that there's companies already
[SPEAKER_03]: doing, uh, tetroploid and stryploid
breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've heard about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all plants that, you know,
so this is where we're going and we're on
[SPEAKER_03]: a, we're trying to be on the coast sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make your name in the industry and keep it
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, also, you know, I'm not
necessarily a scientist, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, my old partner, he was a doctorate in
horticulture, um, major in soil science.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he taught me a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the one who taught me all the
horticulture work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he, uh, so I'm trying to also be like
a bridge, you know, like I'm just a
[SPEAKER_03]: regular guy, a grower, you know,
just really into this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and I, I, I try my best to put stuff
into terms that I can understand,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, sometimes I have to go double
read the definition of stuff, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: read it three or four times to understand
it, you know, but digest it and put it
[SPEAKER_03]: into terms that I can explain to other
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, or, you know, and sometimes
that takes a while, but, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's, that's where I feel like I
personally fit into the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, along with my company is like being
the bridgeway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I want to do the really scientific
stuff and keep up with these guys,
[SPEAKER_03]: but also be able to supply to,
um, the common people and not,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they add on stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate you for that, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get going, brother, um,
would you like to get a couple teasers out
[SPEAKER_00]: there as far as some of these fem lines
that are to be expected this year?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep an eye out for a platinum SFV drop
that we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, got a bunch of really great hybrids
that we're going to really put that on
[SPEAKER_03]: solo burger, um, our pink coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got reg and a few stems that might
drop, but what else coffee we did that you
[SPEAKER_03]: can look back, uh, and don't worry,
I'll be releasing about it, but I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have a lot of speed of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to do some more work with
it.
