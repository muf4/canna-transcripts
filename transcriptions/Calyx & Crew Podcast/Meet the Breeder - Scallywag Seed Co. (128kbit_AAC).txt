[SPEAKER_04]: What is up everybody and welcome to a
brand new episode of the Calix and crew
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast sessions We've got none other than

[SPEAKER_04]: company Let me redo that Scaliwag seed
company is gonna be with us today
[SPEAKER_04]: collector of old-school genetics Huge
librarian of genetics both greeting and
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding and growing for decades now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's give a big hand to Paul actually How
you doing today Paul?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honored to be here and thanks for having
me So let's get a little bit of insight
[SPEAKER_04]: from you I know we got a lot of people
from the US and here today that aren't
[SPEAKER_04]: familiar with Scaliwag Why don't you tell
us a little bit about how you got into
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: What was your first experience like?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just turned 44 this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first experience with cannabis was I
was probably what 13 13 Or 13 or 14 and I
[SPEAKER_00]: grew up in a small town looks like
Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada so we're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: prairies kind of central Canada and I grew
up in a small town that was fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: religious and fairly conservative and with
every kind of religious conservative town
[SPEAKER_00]: there's always a town baddie or a town
kind of pump that every parent always
[SPEAKER_00]: warns you not to hang out with and Somehow
I just gravitated towards this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think a few of us are those guys,
but I think I gravitated towards him In
[SPEAKER_00]: our school that we were at our high school
we took a wood shop together and just your
[SPEAKER_00]: classic like guy who who wasn't really
academic and he was making bongs and would
[SPEAKER_00]: in one class while we were making like key
keychain holders and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah We ended up connecting oddly
through that class and then I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: would hang out with him There's not a lot
to do in these towns So you kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: gravitate to just finding things to do and
I ended up linking with up up with him one
[SPEAKER_00]: night and always I always had this and
kind of infatuation with cannabis the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: The like the the memorabilia from the 60s
the covers of magazines with the pot leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just infatuated with the pot leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of into the music that promoted
cannabis use and so I just naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: really wanted to get into cannabis at that
young age and I kind of gravitated towards
[SPEAKER_00]: him and Because he was making bongs and
stuff in class and one night we were all
[SPEAKER_00]: out together me and another friend and he
drove this really old car like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Batmobile and I remember he just picked me
up one time and we were just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging out and he was like hey you want
to smoke a joint I was like Do I ever and
[SPEAKER_00]: so we ended up smoking this joint perfect
and at the time it was like the first
[SPEAKER_00]: experience it wasn't really amazing,
but I just remember going home that night
[SPEAKER_00]: and eating like a lot of food and But I
knew it was something that I wanted to to
[SPEAKER_00]: try again And then eventually finally
found my my high and was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, this is this is pretty cool man And
what was that?
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the high that you liked?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just the you know, like the the
first time the first few times you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually experience like the actual effect
because I know like my first time You know
[SPEAKER_00]: always heard as you as you got into
cannabis that a lot of people in their
[SPEAKER_00]: first experience didn't really experience
a high it was more just of like a Little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of a fuzziness and then I'm really
hungry or I'm tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to bed And so I was the guy that
got no real effect, but then got really
[SPEAKER_00]: hungry after but I remember achieving the
very first time that really first
[SPEAKER_00]: effective cannabis with a group of friends
when we had Gone and got some more and we
[SPEAKER_00]: all like we all rolled up our own joint We
were like, oh man, we got our own joint
[SPEAKER_00]: each I remember we smoked probably had
enough actually to consume on my own and I
[SPEAKER_00]: remember just being like This is this is
awesome then and so yeah that first
[SPEAKER_00]: experience was in hindsight too now I know
that there was a lot of like Mexi brick
[SPEAKER_00]: that was coming through this like This
kind of group of people like just like
[SPEAKER_00]: where we were there was we're still in
Canada, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we were still being flooded with
like brick weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was that was coming from Mexico There
was a lot of like South American
[SPEAKER_00]: connections that would come through
through Paraguay and a lot of these guys
[SPEAKER_00]: were like We're bringing some of this Mexi
like the South American brick through
[SPEAKER_00]: right and a lot of it also came from
Mexico there's some connections to that
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico kind of a brick that we were
getting as well from the states or from
[SPEAKER_00]: from Mexi itself and so This guy actually
took these seeds and grew them on their
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescence at his mother's house And
that's the first time I actually saw pot
[SPEAKER_00]: that night too that we first experienced
it and it was like Classic sativa to the
[SPEAKER_00]: to the to the ceiling and you know later
on found out that yeah He was just
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking up Mexi brick and growing
whatever you could find there and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like obviously really sativa dominant But
yeah, I just I still remember the flavors
[SPEAKER_00]: like spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember like it had That just that look
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember and it was just like yeah It
was just intriguing and it just was
[SPEAKER_00]: something that you knew you wanted to be a
part of and that's kind of where it all
[SPEAKER_00]: Started and I always say my dad like my
dad really got me started.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was very anti-cannabis But he had no
idea that subliminally he was in like
[SPEAKER_00]: probably I was born in 79 probably in like
the earliest years of getting VCRs he got
[SPEAKER_00]: a VCR and the first movies this guy rented
were Cheech and Chong Like up and smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: and that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I always Say he really
influenced me into cannabis and so,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and he was very anti-cannabis,
which was funny So but he was a big
[SPEAKER_00]: comedian guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the show first time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly Would you say those first
couple of experiences?
[SPEAKER_04]: I Didn't get high my first time either.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't until my second time that I
really felt anything Was that on the
[SPEAKER_04]: Mexican brick wheat?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this was like I said, we would always
go to the city which was Winnipeg So we
[SPEAKER_00]: were always like we're in a small town
about 30 not 20 minutes from From Winnipeg
[SPEAKER_00]: so we would often find someone who was 16
or have someone in our group who was
[SPEAKER_00]: driving and we'd all Pile our money
together and like go There was a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: places that were very famous in Winnipeg
where you could always always find
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis it didn't matter what decade it
was what year what time of day what
[SPEAKER_00]: holiday it didn't matter You can find weed
there and it was always a couple places
[SPEAKER_00]: one was the merchant hotel Which if
anyone's from this area, they'll just know
[SPEAKER_00]: it was classic We had a lot of gang
activity back in the day and this place
[SPEAKER_00]: was a place where a lot of the guys would
would sell their And they would just run
[SPEAKER_00]: up to your car throw crumpled up tin foil
into your lap And you would just give them
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 bucks and you would be on your way But
if you fuck around if you fucked around
[SPEAKER_00]: you found out these guys would carry
porcelain broken up porcelain in their
[SPEAKER_00]: pockets and they would they would shatter
windows if you drove off without payment
[SPEAKER_00]: so it was a pretty rough and quick
exchange and Then a really classic place
[SPEAKER_00]: was the circle and a circle was an Osborne
Village Which is a pretty famous place and
[SPEAKER_00]: that was another place where you would
always get weed But yeah, we would pull
[SPEAKER_00]: our money together go to these locations
and buy like really Good street weed for
[SPEAKER_00]: the time and I remember it would just you
know, the first few times we actually got
[SPEAKER_00]: the effect It was so awesome and intense
that like we all knew me particularly like
[SPEAKER_00]: this is something that I'm gonna have to
definitely Really really experience for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long long time because I enjoyed it so
much So we don't really know what we were
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking at the time But Winnipeg was
always a pretty decent place to get good
[SPEAKER_00]: quality cannabis Like we had a bunch of
avenues where you could get it You can
[SPEAKER_00]: either get it through a lot of the street
gangs like there's a lot of a lot of Youth
[SPEAKER_00]: gangs in our city, you know, and then we
also had like a lot of the biker
[SPEAKER_00]: connections here as well We had some clubs
that were obviously operating here as well
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the selections you you gave us
some of the cross in here I had to ask
[SPEAKER_04]: about the Topanga and then they told me
like the US name of what we call it I was
[SPEAKER_04]: like, ah damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah like the Topanga to me is like I said
like Canada has so many good cuts and so
[SPEAKER_00]: many like so much good cannabis history
and like all Obviously, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're we're neighbors and so like,
you know a lot of us look to you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: though and and do when it comes to like
historical cuts and stuff and so like a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the I'm very blessed to have
friends and have a lot of people that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been able to work with and call friends
that we've been able to trade cuts for
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years and so a lot of my favorite
things that I get to consume or hold or
[SPEAKER_00]: grow or work with is always US stuff like
I mean, I know that we have some really
[SPEAKER_00]: cool stuff here and I don't know if it's
because I'm just here and I've been able
[SPEAKER_00]: to experience it a lot But like I find
some of the guys deals with that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what can I get?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want Well, right and then
and then like, you know Some of the US
[SPEAKER_00]: guys they tell me to like, you know Some
of the Canadian cuts that we set up that
[SPEAKER_04]: way like they enjoy I wanted everybody but

some quick fire questions their guests and
[SPEAKER_04]: You can find that patreon link at patreon
.com forward slash doc underscore calyx So
[SPEAKER_04]: what was the first cultivar that you came
across that really had a name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean probably I mean I was so I
started selling pot when I was in my late
[SPEAKER_00]: teens And I had a really good connection
budget that worked over the West Coast And
[SPEAKER_00]: so we were able to get a lot of like of
the stuff that had names early on But my
[SPEAKER_00]: first growing experience like my very
first cultivar that I really like I I'm a
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry fanatic like a fanatic of
blueberry and have been since the day I
[SPEAKER_00]: first smoked it heard about it saw
pictures of it and so the name came with
[SPEAKER_00]: growing cannabis Oh, it was and it was
just just to see something like that was
[SPEAKER_00]: just so unique and So and then I would get
this West Coast blueberry from my guy and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was like I said I'd come across like
good street stuff before but like to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have something that had a
blueberry smell that was called blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: it just kind of blew my mind and so The
first thing I grew was a blueberry Cut and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was commercial cut that we grew in a
like a commercial setup where we were we
[SPEAKER_00]: were running a house And it was it was
awesome and then my very first clones
[SPEAKER_00]: though that I was able to like secure From
someone who did selections or was able to
[SPEAKER_00]: get something from a breeder was one of my
favorite things was some of the early Like
[SPEAKER_00]: the very early DNA stuff They had a couple
things like sour cream and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a couple clones that a guy
locally had hunted.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a lot of Expendable cash and he was
able to buy seeds at time that were so
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive at the time and he did a lot of
hunting and he had this a couple cuts that
[SPEAKER_00]: were really really special to us and then
some really old Canadian cuts like Rene
[SPEAKER_00]: Rene is a really special cut up here that
that a lot of people love and it was it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a local cut here We had and then we
had some old cus called champagne like a
[SPEAKER_00]: hash plant champagne cut That was also
really good and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I started as a commercial stuff
So we were really trying to get commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers at the time and so it was it was
really a hunt for that sort of Avenue of
[SPEAKER_00]: what we wanted to grow and then the
connoisseur part came a few years later
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the Rene that have any relation
to the Irene?
[SPEAKER_00]: No so Rene Rene is a is a Canadian cut a
prominent breeder that maybe more people
[SPEAKER_00]: would have heard of then he is a great
gardener Matt Barron's great gardener he
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the clone was around for a long
time before he made it kind of his
[SPEAKER_00]: flagship or one of his flagships,
but The great gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's known for Barb Barbara bud orange
Barb Rene in a seed form they did I think
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think they did feminize the S1 that
I think and made s1 seeds of it I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember what they did with the Rene,
but he made it more famous and more
[SPEAKER_00]: prominent But it's a really unique cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a it's not the most potent cut
but it's just got this this absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: pungent nose and flavor that's kind of
like Cool water aftershave.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really unique nose to it and a
skunky like it's really awesome And it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like I said not the most potent
stuff, but it's just a staple here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got such a robust Nose and flavor
that it was always really easy to move
[SPEAKER_00]: like you could always smell it through the
bag and it had a great look to it as
[SPEAKER_00]: popcorn bud and they had like a good high
but nothing that would put you in the
[SPEAKER_00]: couch and so but that was one that a lot
of people ended up passing up as you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the new trend started coming in and those
are the things that I love scooping up or
[SPEAKER_00]: hunting and getting hold of after they've
been kind of forgotten about because you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, I always find there's either a
revival in in a lot of ways either just
[SPEAKER_00]: from from nostalgia or just people Seeking
out tools that are a little bit less poly
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid hybridized And so this cut though
is a bit of a pain in the ass like a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of these old cus to grow It's a finicky
and old and takes a lot of care,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I actually just ran a plant It's
actually just in the corner of it and it
[SPEAKER_00]: just finished like it likes turning single
manners, too So it's it's sometimes gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be an ugly plant, but it's just the smell
and flavor It's so nostalgic for us and I
[SPEAKER_00]: just love it so much and it's actually
it'll cross is pretty fairly well,
[SPEAKER_00]: too We've out crossed it to a few things
And even though it has that tendency to
[SPEAKER_00]: throw single manners It seems to sometimes
out cross really well depending who it
[SPEAKER_00]: pairs with adds unique flavor and noses to
it that you just don't really there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing in it and cannabis that smells
like it in my opinion and a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: people's opinion that that get to
experience it but it's one of those things
[SPEAKER_00]: that not a lot of people know of so Those
are the ones that you don't got to keep
[SPEAKER_04]: around.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll get shared and it'll stay around
yeah, and there's a reason why people like
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to seek it out again like 10 15 years
after they had smoked it or you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the best thing when you break it out
at a party here because it is a local
[SPEAKER_00]: strain that people know and so when you
sometimes break it out at like a Christmas
[SPEAKER_00]: party or like a birthday or anniversary
people are like Fuck man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, they're like I've smoked
out before and you're like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's ready And they're like,
yeah the guy got a girlfriend and her guy
[SPEAKER_00]: used to always bring this stuff over
That's it man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked it for years and that's kind of
ready to us There's a lot of those
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, but that's ready to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my experience Yeah, my favorite
string Going growing early on would have
[SPEAKER_00]: had to have been our early blueberry cut
that we were getting and we don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: where it came from I know it was from the
West Coast, but it was just it was
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really really awesome cut Okay,
that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't messed around with the
blueberries too much I have done a sativa
[SPEAKER_04]: leaning blueberry and a broad leaf
blueberry the one that I got from Canada
[SPEAKER_04]: It was definitely a thin leaf it had
longer inner nodes and it had very Purple
[SPEAKER_04]: buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually pretty impressed by that
one Nice strongest stuff, but it was
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking it was tasty Yeah, we feel like we
have a pretty like deep history of
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry here there is a lot of blueberry
that and we like like you said we have two
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct kind of Types and it's obviously
a thin a thin like a narrow leaf and then
[SPEAKER_00]: a broad leaf and both are great and I was
keeping a couple that Have narrow and
[SPEAKER_00]: broad and we had to narrow it down a
little bit like we were talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: Catalog being narrowed down and I stuck
with a few of my favorites, but there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple Fraser Valley blueberries Like
there's a broad leaf the original broad
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf Fraser Valley blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a harder plant to get now It's almost
extinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a very kind of narrow
leaf sativa leaning beautiful Blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: type sativa hash plant that I held for a
long time was able to preserve and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: but it just had a absolutely like For me I
like a really potent stuff like potent
[SPEAKER_00]: high it just Had no high to me really
beautiful in every other aspect great for
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding great for just experiencing a
very light No burnout, but just didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have any potency for me and it's funny you
get rid of things and then suddenly people
[SPEAKER_00]: are like that's what people want and so
like I've had to I've had to sadly be like
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that anymore like I can get
it but I don't have it it's kind of a pain
[SPEAKER_00]: to find but yeah, so we have lots and then
I have my favorite blueberry which is my
[SPEAKER_00]: Winnie the blue which is my my flagship
blueberry cut which I love so so
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendously much and that has a little
tribute to Winnipeg where I'm from because
[SPEAKER_00]: Winnie the Pooh was kind of born and bred
in Winnipeg, Manitoba like the the famous
[SPEAKER_00]: character and so it was named after Winnie
the blue so or Winnie the poops Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what was the cross on the Winnie the
blue?
[SPEAKER_00]: so Winnie the blue comes from a lot of my
work and some of my early stock and
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier things that I was able to be so
lucky to get comes from we had this group
[SPEAKER_00]: on the stunk magazine forum This was
probably about 10 or 12 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this really special time skunk
forum skunk magazine had this forum where
[SPEAKER_00]: there was people like Myself and I mean I
was just a newb but there was people like
[SPEAKER_00]: the Revver their snow high Just some
tremendous people there was this elder a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of elders too that were not known But
were really really influential in their
[SPEAKER_00]: own right this old-timer elder called the
time tunnel and time tunnel is just a
[SPEAKER_00]: really really special guy and He had some
really amazing just amazing work and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that he had done over his history of
loving this plant and He was able to we
[SPEAKER_00]: were is a really nice seed exchange place
and so we exchanged seeds and he gave me
[SPEAKER_00]: some original work called time tunnels 80s
blueberry and at the time I was just you
[SPEAKER_00]: know chasing everything blueberry and I
ended up running those seeds and we found
[SPEAKER_00]: this amazing plant called I called Winnie
the blue and Actually right now we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a just preserving the line again
doing some f3 work on it right now And
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what I was sexing like I was
telling you 13 minutes before the show
[SPEAKER_00]: started still doing sexing work here
before the show started So so we're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: some f3s now op f3s just to preserve the
line minimizing some things out of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but gonna do a Pretty good open OP.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping to do maybe 15 females what
we're down to and probably about eight or
[SPEAKER_00]: nine males We're just kind of eliminating
Eliminating some things right now that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not I'm not really a fan of I'm
trying to give it up all the earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: flower and stuff and the blueberry males
and try to keep the ones that are holding
[SPEAKER_00]: on to their their Which is a first I
usually like putting both in the line But
[SPEAKER_00]: this time around we're gonna try to
eliminate some of those ones that drop all
[SPEAKER_04]: a little bit soon So we're gonna give a
few packs of your seeds away at the end of
[SPEAKER_04]: the show as well two packs are gonna Go to
our members one pack is going to come to
[SPEAKER_04]: anybody that came to watch this show We're
gonna roll a little roulette wheel and you
[SPEAKER_04]: guys will get some seeds I was looking at
these ones that you donated for us,
[SPEAKER_04]: which by the way again Thank you so much
beyond generous and Honor man,
[SPEAKER_04]: but how does the Winnie the blue differ
from the Dennis the menace?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Winnie the blue is the female is a
female 80s blueberry from time tunnel So
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, that's my flagship blueberry
strain That's the one that I found and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can go see the actual documentation of it,
which is really cool and I see Meg There's
[SPEAKER_00]: a I see Meg thread called Paul and bombing
episode one because I'm also a huge Star
[SPEAKER_00]: Wars geek and it's a really cool thing
just to go back and see some of the old
[SPEAKER_00]: work that you do and it was All preserved
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of go back and see some of
the you actually see the run where Winnie
[SPEAKER_00]: was found But Winnie the blue is the
female 80s time tunnel blueberry and then
[SPEAKER_00]: like I had mentioned I was blueberry
fanatic early on and so Once those
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial crop started I had always been
looking at magazines buying seeds and I
[SPEAKER_00]: started really buying anything I could buy
it for DJ short blueberry or any type of
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry cross and so we ended up buying
some earlier seeds from DJ and Dennis the
[SPEAKER_00]: menace was a variety or a Type I found in
some old DJ blueberry seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not like old not like everyone's like
pre-98 pre-98 like, you know, this is like
[SPEAKER_00]: early 2000s probably 2005 2006 so the line
was still pretty decent at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were still getting some like really
nice blueberry Finos long before the You
[SPEAKER_00]: know the loam and the sandy loam and the
musky and the like pork wine and all that
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of like Flavor took over the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a lot of blueberries So we found
this really nice blueberry male and I
[SPEAKER_00]: named this blueberry cut that I Used for
four years in my in my earlier blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: work Dennis and menace and my
father-in-law Dennis was a real awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: guy, but he was also a menace and so we
named it after him Dennis and menace and
[SPEAKER_00]: he passed away So rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but yeah, it's a difference Yeah,
and that's the difference so one's female
[SPEAKER_00]: different line to altogether and there was
some projects on with both but Winnie the
[SPEAKER_00]: blue over the years to spade as the
library got narrowed down because It's my
[SPEAKER_00]: flagship.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just there's no blueberry plant I've
experienced to this day that I I truly
[SPEAKER_00]: love and cherish more.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so special to me I really want to dig
in here so much about that that library
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard you have an extensive one and
I'm sure there's a ton of things that's
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna tickle not only my goat But a lot of
people that are in here as well because we
[SPEAKER_04]: got some older growers Sure before we get
into that though What was the change
[SPEAKER_04]: between?
[SPEAKER_04]: You growing cannabis to breeding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there a time gap or it kind of
coincide with each other?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think just Like progression like for me
like I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like to I when I get into
something I get really into something It's
[SPEAKER_00]: like that in in every aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like that with like drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like that with everything
everything music so I really just um and
[SPEAKER_00]: then for years like you said we just look
at the magazines and we're on the forums
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're just We're just it's I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's just seeing it's seeing work and
seeing other people's Drive and dedication
[SPEAKER_00]: to their work that yeah, I just Saw these
catalogs and then started buying seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: then started doing you know I started
taking some university courses for my
[SPEAKER_00]: professional job that I ended up ended up
with early on and a lot of it was
[SPEAKER_00]: science-based and so it was just kind of
went hand-in-hand and so Started doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of like smaller hobby stuff
just to kind of make seed and then see
[SPEAKER_00]: what it see what I could do and then What
what we could find and then realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: like there's nothing more exciting now in
my life and like making selections and
[SPEAKER_00]: then putting them together and then Doing
either like some some small inline
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding or just running phenol hunts like
phenol hunts to me To this day doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: now for for quite some time like there's
nothing more exciting in the world Than
[SPEAKER_00]: than a phenol hunt like especially when
it's your own work like I always say be
[SPEAKER_00]: your favorite breeder like or be your
favorite seed maker and if you truly If
[SPEAKER_00]: you truly have a calendar that's just
filled with your own seed starts to me
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like you've reached already the
pinnacle that you know every breeder or
[SPEAKER_00]: seed maker should reach it's not about
Getting your seeds out there to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about you know making money to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about Loving the work that you're
doing enough that it is always on the
[SPEAKER_00]: calendar of the seed starts like sure You
start other people's work, but the real
[SPEAKER_00]: excitement is right in your own garden
right in your own notebooks And just
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing your work in front of you to me
It's there's just it's what keeps me going
[SPEAKER_00]: in the darkest days when you're stuck at
your nine to five And you're just like you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and you're you're going broke from
all the shipping you're covering and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just like You're you're struggling
a little bit, but you're like dude I have
[SPEAKER_00]: a phenol hunt going on in my room,
and it's just amazing right now,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's to me That's the guys doing
this this one's doing this this one's yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: like week six week six phenol hunt on a
shorter like a BLD like or a hybrid like
[SPEAKER_00]: week six seven like to me That is just
there's no happier time in the world of
[SPEAKER_00]: making seeds and running your work and
looking at your lines And you know making
[SPEAKER_00]: plans and goals from that that that phenol
hunt like that is this most special time
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have one going on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it's a little it's just electric
It's just to me why why you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it and obviously getting it out and
having other people experience it It's
[SPEAKER_00]: just it's an honor, and it's just icing on
the cake But it's just like really within
[SPEAKER_00]: the day this should all be about your own
enjoyment of what you're doing or like why
[SPEAKER_00]: do it like don't do it because you want to
make money or you want a following or
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to impress this guy or
Impress this group or crew like it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: matter have fun man and just like do what
you want man And that's if that's what it
[SPEAKER_00]: should be about so and that's what it's
been about been blessed for that But that
[SPEAKER_00]: was the progression was just seeing better
and better things as things went on like
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of hoping this would this would
be what I would see in this Little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: work and little bit of adjusting I did to
this one line And I'm seeing that now not
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe in what I would like to see in the
greater scheme But I'm just seeing little
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I was hoping to see is now
present in this further work And so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just progression progression progression
and then as you get more in tune with
[SPEAKER_00]: people in the community and better
relationships form then it's just Like I
[SPEAKER_00]: said, I've been so blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to pay for seeds for so long
And I had a raid where I lost my seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: so I had to rebuild and it was just
literally because of these relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: you form with other Fanatic people who
just love the plant love the community
[SPEAKER_00]: love sharing Want progression in friends
and other breeders and other seed makers
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't trying to hinder anyone's progress
It's just an open sharing type community
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been able to rebuild and with the
better genetics that come in you see
[SPEAKER_00]: better things better line work and it's
just a progression all the time and so it
[SPEAKER_00]: was really about Just seeing that sort of
work and just wanting to do more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: and more and then also getting a better
catalog better access to genetics and then
[SPEAKER_00]: really at the end of the day also kind of
saving some money because there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: point there where And I'll never take a
hit at anybody charging $1,000 for their
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you want to do man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your that's what you do But like
there were some seeds that people I knew
[SPEAKER_00]: were paying like $1,000 for and you know,
even up even up So so yeah It was a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of everything to really progress and
to start doing the the breeding work and
[SPEAKER_00]: seed seed Making work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I Hear that joint be enrolled right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've been trying to get out for
15-20 minutes We are almost at the halfway
[SPEAKER_04]: mark and that's usually where I like to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're down you light up that joint
I don't have a joint ready and I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, I'm smoking some sorry balls
equipment around but I will definitely dab
[SPEAKER_04]: with you We're doing I am more of a flower
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just way out here to dab always dude
I'm a joint guy smoke joints all the time
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking all day and they're always like We
were sitting with some friends and we were
[SPEAKER_00]: laughing They're like how big are you
fucking joints man?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh nice, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's beautiful, dude Beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Tropic Thunder Okay,
cool, man Yeah, I'm doing some seri chem
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the seri Paul which is the Afghan
Pakistani times the Kim Dong anyone Femme
[SPEAKER_00]: and this has been like this has been just
my obsession for the last like
[SPEAKER_00]: Year-and-a-half, but this last run has
been just a female hunt and I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: obsessed I love working with the the chem
family because it brings that that really
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy potency and some of those traits
like the that you see in like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the sours and the the the rubbers
and the like the skunky notes and this the
[SPEAKER_00]: You know just that funk and I just love
the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I find this stuff is just it's
right on my alley, man Yeah, that's my
[SPEAKER_04]: type of stuff too I've never worked with
any of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've worked with skunks, but I've never
worked with the Kim's I heard they're
[SPEAKER_04]: really picky.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not want to Start with that name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a real pain But like the 91 like
the 91 to me is and just like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no place in this plant It's just
been something that's found its way
[SPEAKER_00]: towards me and I've been blessing up the
hole then I'll always say that all the
[SPEAKER_00]: shadows and the accolades to these guys
that help this plant since 91 Everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: that had their hand in it There's some
really famous people and some really
[SPEAKER_00]: well-known guys that have really put their
life on the line to keep this chem dog 91
[SPEAKER_00]: safe and and You know all all shoutouts
and athletes to those guys Like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a small spoke in the wheel that just
cherishes this plant and loves this 91 But
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that really at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just was lucky enough to experience it
So shout out to those guys and we all know
[SPEAKER_00]: who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to say their names I won't
name drop those guys are just I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing community members and readers and
you know, they hold that place rightly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So My god, that was delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, man Like I said, I I like the
accurate stuff, but there's still like
[SPEAKER_00]: there's still those sweet Trump I like
there's so much of it now that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: find some really amazing Flavors in this
in all this new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of out right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been around for a while I'm a hundred
percent with you because just like I told
[SPEAKER_04]: you I'm really into skunks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really into Kim's I even like a good
og Yeah, if I had the choice, I would only
[SPEAKER_04]: choose fruity about 25% of the time
probably Yeah, and I'm with you one of my
[SPEAKER_04]: favorite breeders up to this point has
been dynasty genetics Which does like a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of fruit?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I am gonna go that way I'm gonna go
that way but my thing more than anything
[SPEAKER_04]: is Fino hunting land races, so that's why
I'm not as scared anymore to work with the
[SPEAKER_04]: Kim's as I was before I did want to get
some Some thoughts directly from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever had a failed breeding
project?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you just scrapped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many that you just scrap.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the problem with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what do you do with those seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have this like fucking fridge
full of shit and like right one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most legendary dudes archive I mean,
he's got some funny stories where he's
[SPEAKER_00]: just like he's got fridges of stuff and I
mean archive is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got I mean I would find it hard to
believe that he's got anything sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean like yeah, I mean there's you
know, it's hard I just I just kill him
[SPEAKER_00]: like I just get rid of them or you know,
sometimes people are just like they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow a large population of something
and they just want to do it and they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to pay for seeds and so you just
explain to them like dude I can give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of seeds, but they didn't turn out
the way I like them and they they have
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of negative thing that's why I
didn't want it and you know, but of course
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of stuff that has just been
scrapped and that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what would you say to somebody that's
newer newer to breeding that had a failed
[SPEAKER_04]: project or whatever and that was really
disheartening to them coming from your
[SPEAKER_04]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like to this day you going
through phenol hunts is a huge lot in life
[SPEAKER_04]: that brings you joy.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you continue on with that attitude
after failed projects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you just have to get into this
knowing that you're getting into something
[SPEAKER_00]: like breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're working with you're working with
things that you don't really get to see
[SPEAKER_00]: until all this work is invested in it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like any art form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really have to have a passion for
it and have to understand getting into
[SPEAKER_00]: this that dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I said you you you can go broke
doing this like you know, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: people might you might have a following or
people have a following.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you have to understand there is
huge things that you give up to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's not a it's not a fun job like
just running a commercial garden or a
[SPEAKER_00]: connoisseur garden if you want to use that
term where you're growing, you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred plants and you're you're growing
25 you're growing four different plant or
[SPEAKER_00]: four different cultivars or whatever it is
you're growing this amazing always
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting beautiful flowers and you're
processing these beautiful flowers that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're making hash or flower whatever
doing perpetually usually yeah and seed
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds is like can be really fucking boring
man and like, you know, you're you can
[SPEAKER_00]: lose money doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's part of the game that and so
it's just like anyone that chooses
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever pathway in this community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you have to really sit back and in
life and just be like is this these are
[SPEAKER_00]: the pros.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what can happen negatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the positive and you just have to
figure if it's something that you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do but make sure you understand getting
into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to have projects that just
stink and you're going to be like fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wasted eight months pollinating,
you know, keeping mothers around taking
[SPEAKER_00]: clones of phenotypes that I thought might
be awesome and they all just fucking stink
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, and you learn from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully it doesn't happen as often
as it can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully you're lucky enough to like
bring some sort of you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-intelligence to the game where you did
some reading and some research and some
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some theory based stuff and then
you're applying it to your practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like anything that just the
more you apply the more theory makes sense
[SPEAKER_00]: the more theory you can add and the more
application you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into your thing and get better and better
and better and like progression is always
[SPEAKER_00]: the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even if you're not saying don't
quit, like I said, as long as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: having fun, do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep making shitty shitty
projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as you're having fun,
I mean, you know, try not to share the
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was directly for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got really lucky with my first few
breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: They came out exactly like I wanted to and
I was on an F3 and the progeny in that
[SPEAKER_04]: group just sucked.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just too male dominant in the whole
fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it disheartened me so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just didn't even continue on with that
line.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got people asking me to this day,
can I get some of the season like I know I
[SPEAKER_04]: scrapped that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to me, scrapping a project because
it's something that you don't want versus
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's problematic is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can there's definitely I have
like I have so many projects in the fridge
[SPEAKER_00]: that like there's no problems with it,
but they're just not like I wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate and it turned out fruity or I
wanted short class and they turned out
[SPEAKER_00]: tall like stuff like that, that I'm still
holding on to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy to give away in large
amounts to people that need seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I always explain like,
hey, they're they're not what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm giving them to you for,
you know, your for whatever you want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but no, I definitely hear you,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a good perspective to have on
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't really problematic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just made the wrong selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back and rework it.
[SPEAKER_04]: At that point, I had no idea or didn't
even think to use multiple males and
[SPEAKER_04]: isolate the pollen on different branches
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: One run.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, you learn right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you formulate and you replan and
then you do something again or you do it
[SPEAKER_00]: over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: With better success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the big things adjustments was
doing that one work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you do regular breeding with
regular males for, you know, a long long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you suddenly are tasked with
learning something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, hopefully you you have some
sense and it's easy to kind of take on the
[SPEAKER_00]: theory, which it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got to apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one thing with selfing is it
doesn't matter who's doing the selfing,
[SPEAKER_00]: what breed it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just sometimes run into issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, you know, it's it's part of
that kind of realm of making seeds with
[SPEAKER_00]: with selfing projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone struggles with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard the best of the best talk about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just had a problem here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to do a whole room with a
certain female that was or a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just did not drop pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a time frame I was really trying
to stick to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so thank God you have some backup
stuff that you've collected that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you can use in case you need a
backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, we changed from a chem dog
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to a blueberry room and so
everything got hit with blueberry instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and that's just the way it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I have a back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm learning on this episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope everybody over there in Chad is
holy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's dig in a little bit more to this
library that you've collected over all
[SPEAKER_04]: these years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, actually, let's go back really
quick, because I can't say that I there's
[SPEAKER_04]: no way I can go over it and say I missed
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So can we talk about the rate or not?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, for sure, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we was kind of legalized in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was October of 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should know, but fucking sometimes you
don't remember things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it was September, October
2016, kind of legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had been growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had been a nurse for almost a decade and
was growing pot for my own medical
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of my university is nursing was I
really, really gravitated towards nursing
[SPEAKER_00]: law and like justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so part of that was learning about
harm reduction and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I come from 2016.
2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalization was 2016, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, raid was the same year 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so part of the nursing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I got interrupted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, raid was 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was a nurse at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just didn't want to get I felt that
it was just it wasn't right to have to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way it worked is you have to get a
doctor to sign for your medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way you could really get a
medical in Canada at the time was you had
[SPEAKER_00]: to have like like a really terrible
ailment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have to have like some sort of
wasting disorder from either AIDS or a
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer diagnosis where you were getting
something for for for your symptom
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I suffer from horrible anxiety,
depression and have for my entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just couldn't get signage from a
doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way I could do it was that to
go to B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: to get a signage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to pay five thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a doctor who doesn't even know you
and just signs you a paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was growing illegally,
but I was quite OK with it because I knew
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't breaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't hurting anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was applying my own medicine and I was
really doing my own thing while I was
[SPEAKER_00]: while I was a nurse and went to my nursing
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the part of my nursing career.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so 2016 rolled around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalization was literally around the
corner in in October and September.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife and I were leaving the house and
boom, we got arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we got arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got arrested there and then raid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Followed, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they raided my house and they had been
following or watching our house for about
[SPEAKER_00]: a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was all based on a I have great
neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in a great community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a really awesome, like middle
class place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's really friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I I used to do everything I could to
mask smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I'm growing really fucking
stinky plants and I'm doing everything I
[SPEAKER_00]: can like going above and beyond charcoal
filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm coming up with my own homemade
things to like dryer sheets outside and
[SPEAKER_00]: owner owner tanks and just everything you
can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's still a bit of an odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so someone kept complaining about
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: One neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's more of like a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really not people that live
here, but it's just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they seem inconvenienced with the smell at
their business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so kept complaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we started getting watched for
about a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the raid hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they had been they had been
watching us for a week and they thought
[SPEAKER_00]: they had a pretty big operation because of
the smell they were smelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was quite pleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They felt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when they raided us, they were
quite disappointed because, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, most of my grows always mother
plants and a library of stuff that wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my flowering area was quite small.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they hyperinflated everything in the
paper that it was a real big outfit and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all this sort of bad stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in that process, I mean, I lost all my
mother plants and my seed collection,
[SPEAKER_00]: which at the time was, I mean,
I still I still get sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like losing something that you just
will never get back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that was the raid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they like literally they arrested us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up having to we ended up spending,
you know, short of one hundred thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars for our legal fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was ended up getting house arrest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was lucky, really lucky to get house
arrest because at the time we had
[SPEAKER_00]: mandatory minimums for growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just a little bit under the
mandatory minimum for five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was still a mandatory minimum of
a year in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was able to have a good lawyer and
really fight and pay and get six months
[SPEAKER_00]: house arrest or a year house arrest,
but six absolute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you ended up walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're from nursing as a result of it
because there was a fight there for
[SPEAKER_00]: professional misconduct, which is part of
being a professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah, today I ended up and part of it
was also getting some cannabis contracts
[SPEAKER_00]: in the legal world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a good transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of how things played out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah, it didn't really stop me
because I ended up getting my ACM ACM PR
[SPEAKER_00]: about two months after the raid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally broke down and was like,
OK, this is serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get let's get some protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and and warrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warranty for the first time, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, like a lot of us dealt with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know friends that did five years for
cannabis.
So.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, in my mind, it's horseshit
for a day, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get at the end of the day, we're growing
a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You won't.
[SPEAKER_04]: You shouldn't be able to arrest me for
cannabis piss any more than you can for a
[SPEAKER_04]: tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really like like I had a six year
old daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you know, we were smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're I have a we have a pretty
pretty smart family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we knew there was always potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like just like a family makes a
fire plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so odd that when you're a
cannabis family, like you have to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: raid plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank God we had because my daughter
was just a trooper and my wife,
[SPEAKER_00]: who is the most I mean, I like I owe
everything every everyone who does this,
[SPEAKER_00]: who makes this commitment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you have a partner in your life
that that that's been with you through
[SPEAKER_00]: some of this stuff, like she's been
through my raid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just all everything is dedicated to
them because like I wouldn't be here if it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't for her, the the shit she did for
me when the raid happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the just seen all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter, just how supportive they
were, how stoked they were, how brave they
[SPEAKER_00]: were.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, if you have a partner
that that stands beside you and you do
[SPEAKER_00]: what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like I said, they're the real all
stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but yeah, it was so hard on our family,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just tear your house apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember my biggest fear when I like
was getting interviewed is was like I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought they they not only they take all
my plants, but I thought they took all my
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm a living soil guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had been like that is my like going
on my eighth year at the time of making my
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was so worried out of all the
things that was also gone was my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember they were just looking at me
like I was fucking insane that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: worried about soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it was a really scary time,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still hard to get over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just changes you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You become a little bit more like jaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a that's the word for it right
there, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this community the community came
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you, I got my license two
months later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking had no seeds, no clones left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to salvage like every story you
hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went in the back alley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to pull a couple fucking clones
off a dead mother that they forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fucking they ripped me down,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but within within two months,
I had every clone I had shared and had at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time, which was a pretty extensive
library at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only did I have most of those seeds
that, you know, maybe there was some I
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't get back, but I still had stuff
that was given to me that I knew came from
[SPEAKER_00]: other people's special, special places
that they would normally not part with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just shows the level of,
you know, if you're dialed into this
[SPEAKER_00]: community and you're you're actually not
trying to like fuck it and you've got good
[SPEAKER_00]: people and good groups with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing place to be a part of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but yeah, man, we're all stronger from
the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the day, like I said,
life shit happens and it's just you just
[SPEAKER_00]: got to be happy where you are and I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's dig into your library really quick
because I've got all your seeds here and
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking through some of these and
there's some holy shit names in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like I said, lucky, very lucky to
have friends and like very lucky to be
[SPEAKER_00]: trusted with stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, it goes two ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite thing to do in life is to be
able to give something back to somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: that they've lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's the most I mean,
the most honorable thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most honored thing you can feel is
when someone reaches out to you and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like, dude, I lost my breeder cut
of so and so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, hey, man, just give me
your address.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the coolest thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's just the circle of
blessing, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you got to really put that time and
investment and trust in and it pays back,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just that reciprocal,
awesome thing that this community
[SPEAKER_00]: produces.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so unlike any other community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to name.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to, you think you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to, of course, we can talk to
your voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll answer whatever you got there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to ask you a name like
your top five favorite, but.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: The list runs through the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I could name my top five for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, like, obviously, my favorite
plant of all time is the came down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone's all time favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I have no hand in that
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just lucky.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get to ask the desert island
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like grown well, though,
because like it can be grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be butchered like it needs to be
really well grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that comes with really getting to know
her well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I just am lucky to be a
steward to her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have no hand in this plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just affected me in a way that I was
lucky to be able to experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I really am a huge fan of like
Canadian kush plants or like like we have
[SPEAKER_00]: a few that kick around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I'm a huge fan of like and I mean,
obviously, like these plants originated in
[SPEAKER_00]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't take any credit for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like purple kush, the original purple
kush is like there's a there's a few of
[SPEAKER_00]: those original cuts that that to me are
just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a Canadian guy, Dire Wolf,
who's just like a true G2.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an amazing guy in so many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: He he's got a really special clone only of
a purple kush that I think is probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: best purple kush cut I've ever consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's like, you know,
some certain some other cuts to like
[SPEAKER_00]: Garberville.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's the there's a few with the SF
and just a whole bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But purple kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a famous cut here,
pink kush, which is like people will tease
[SPEAKER_00]: you if you like it, like because it's so
fucking well known here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody is just like done with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, no more pink kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't care what anyone says.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a special plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that I love the master.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Master Kush, to me, like the there's two
two really well known funos of master.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like the short one that's horror,
really hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tall lankier master.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the tall lanky master Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm an OG like I mean,
to me, the best plants are OGs,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some OG plants that I really,
really cherish.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple of Canadian ones here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like Rogio G, which is like a
purple Cali OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like the obviously like the the
the American OGs are the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I guess it's really hard to
narrow five down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I could do it,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those are like I'm stuck on OG now
because I wasn't expecting that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So out of your OGs, what would be top
three OGs?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think probably the best OG that I've
ever consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able just to finally get and I would
probably be like the M1 OG or the SPSC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the sour best shit ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also known as like my number one OG,
the M1 OG, which I think is it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That to me is really, really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm finding to like we have this
Canadian OG cut, which is Rogio G.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's only called Rogio G because
there's a producer of concentrates in B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: called Rogi Concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got his hand on this cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no one seems to really know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it comes from California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just got this really light purple
colour into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just got this tremendous gas
flavour that I really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, there's all your
classes like San Fernando Ghost.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I don't hold all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are probably my favorite ones
that I hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got a couple of Irene at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Irene is there's a couple of guys
in Canada that have done a lot of work
[SPEAKER_00]: with it and really, really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few friends hold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, it's it's it's something
that's being really enjoyed and you used
[SPEAKER_00]: by a couple of people that I know that are
either doing work with it or they're
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing something with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know it's tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just not something that I I hold
or work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that it's it's it's a legend in
its own right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's floats around for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed you mentioned Archive earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one of my favourite OGs was the
Rude Boy that he made.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just something about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it's a floral OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what makes it original.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's got it's still got OG
properties to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I love that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have his hazmat OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's archives that hazmat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and that just came from another really
special friend of mine who I'm really
[SPEAKER_00]: lucky to know from the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a really influential guy in my
library.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been so generous sending me some
stuff that like, you know, I would never
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to get my hands on if it wasn't
for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just able to get some hazmat OG
cuts from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been in quarantine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're out in the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be getting flowered soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like I said, he's a special guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He always gets really special,
hard to find US stuff that I'm just so
[SPEAKER_00]: lucky to get my hands on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and we also able to get just the I
guess it's the crinkle cut legend,
[SPEAKER_00]: legend Kush, legend OG, but legend Kush
crinkle cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's another grower on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't name drop, but he grows it quite,
quite well in his room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's really good threads of it on
ICMAG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another cut that I just like,
I can't believe I got my hands on that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: able to to start working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nothing to me is just unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the one with the leaves that
like do the wave thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's got a weird crinkle to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like a distinctive feature,
kind of like some other cuts that we that
[SPEAKER_00]: we know of that do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's but yeah, it's it's mistaken as
an OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a chem dominant crinkle
cut OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is like it's more of a legend
Kush they call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're really guys who grow it and
know it really well versus OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but it's really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mean, really, really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love and then I'm finding my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like I said, that's that's been
the really cool thing is a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that I work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find working with a dog, the 91,
a lot of its its pairings or S1 work with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I love running large numbers of chem
dog 91 S1s because I find in that
[SPEAKER_00]: population like I have found things that
have become my favorite OG types or sour
[SPEAKER_00]: type plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I just have a name, but they have
like a number or some sort of marking in
[SPEAKER_00]: my garden that like I just love so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm smoking more than like the
original mother, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's got a little bit more bigger
and it brings a little bit more flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, you know, it's got the
high, but it's got a little bit something
[SPEAKER_00]: else to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, like I said, the carry the Surrey
Chem line, which is the Surrey Paul,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's bringing that really special Afghan
Pakistani from the mother I used to the to
[SPEAKER_00]: the 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're finding like all the traits
that I love in the 91 outcrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, having this beautiful library is
so wicked,
but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so stuff like that is Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Breeder Steve Sweet Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone knows Breeder Steve and he has
this tremendous clone only Sweet Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not to be confused with Island Sweet
Skunk, which is a seed line, but Breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Sweet Skunk clone only is this
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's type cultivar that's very high
pining.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a beautiful pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got really potent effects,
long lasting high long legs on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a tremendous plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like I said, if you're able to
get your hands on it and grow it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's one of these plants that like it's
got that old school everything we love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long legs, great high, great flavor,
great nose, great effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Jihadi Kush was I'm lucky enough
to to work with and have Charles Scott as
[SPEAKER_00]: a a mentor of mine and friend,
a reefer man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been friends for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a tester and did some pictures for
some of his ads like years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've just been buddies for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's treated a lot of stuff and given me a
lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had this line Jihadi Kush that he
called Jihadi Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was also like an aft pack Nepalese
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it had some really nice kind of land
race type based origin type P1s to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that line is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got this like hazy old school type
clone only from Canada mixed with this
[SPEAKER_00]: like Afghan, Paki, Nepalese line that
reframended.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the siblings are really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get really kind of everything from
across the board, but all old school kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of notes and flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tremendous, as Joey Diaz would say,
tremendous, tremendous stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like I said, the fridge is like
I'm moving in so many new directions with
[SPEAKER_00]: like doing the S1 work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the selfing stuff and the feminized
stuff that I have this fridge now of so
[SPEAKER_00]: much regular stuff that's just kind of
sitting around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so lately when I've been getting some
some really awesome people that are are
[SPEAKER_00]: are grabbing larger amounts, I just
fucking like, oh, yeah, fucking thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: so much, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just throw in like just a ridiculous
amount of freebies of stuff that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: laying around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hit me up, Matt, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you want extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hit you up for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that more than anything,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have no idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: And likewise, if there's anything I can
get you, I've got an extensive library.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, most of my stuff is mostly land
races, but I got some good other stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The land race is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for sure, man, we'll talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fucking joyous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm OK with going through chems now
is because I've gone through a few
[SPEAKER_04]: different land race phenol hunts now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't take you more than a couple
of runs to realize most of this is trash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm lucky if I find something that I
really, really like out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then at that point, I'm really,
really lucky if I find something that I
[SPEAKER_04]: like that outcross as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's land races like I was in
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we all go through this phase and
sometimes longer than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were in a long phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had partners and other crews that we had
like my partner from Golden or from
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenbeaver Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were on this kick for land race like we
were running everything we get our hands
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like land race is just what you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like generally it's it's unworked and
it's just like it's it's hit or miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to run through so much to find a
gem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you do find a gem, it's a fucking
gem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the times, you know,
if it's got some of the stuff you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for in that line that you were
kind of either heard of or had experienced
[SPEAKER_00]: early on, sometimes they work as
tremendous breeding tools or outcrossing
[SPEAKER_00]: tools and the stuff that you use them for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not even consume it that often,
but you do use it and keep it around
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is such a treasure or such an
amazing tool to use in further things that
[SPEAKER_00]: you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a lot of stuff like that where I
love to consume it, but don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: consume it every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But definitely keep it around strictly
because I love working with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's value and using it to make
things better in other projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just being a hobby grower for many
years, I found out pretty quick that I
[SPEAKER_04]: really love growing work lines of stuff
that I love.
[SPEAKER_04]: But some of my favorite plants to grow
were some, like you said, reefer man
[SPEAKER_04]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Snow high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of those guys that were doing the
early just straight hybrid work before
[SPEAKER_04]: everything was poly hybridized,
you know, or at least fighting the poly
[SPEAKER_04]: hybrids that were there and just going
back to good old classic hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of those plants were like my
favorite plants to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was something that I was like,
I want to create that with different
[SPEAKER_04]: strains around the world that a lot of
people aren't using, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: something different, something new.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think cannabis, more than anything right
now, in the modern market needs more
[SPEAKER_04]: diversity than anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're I mean, we're in a period
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, everyone complains about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know, I don't I don't like
to show on any cut or any variety or any
[SPEAKER_00]: strain like I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, cookies was so influential in my
like there was a period where I was just
[SPEAKER_00]: like obsessed with cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure some people were and some people
shit on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not judging.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's good cookies out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's got a place.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just speaking from a standpoint of how
much diversity we had back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it feels like more people are just
trying to get seeds out there by breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: the same families together and make it a
little bit different because you got sick
[SPEAKER_04]: of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll bring some new genetics into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a new line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a legal market here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, if you look at the legal market
trends, it's like it's I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's literally saturated with like the
same the same looking the same like
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, the effect creating types of
varieties that like we would all consider
[SPEAKER_00]: high modern day strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's you know, you just don't want to
shit on anyone that's making that type of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like because what's happening is a
lot of these Canadian places are buying
[SPEAKER_00]: clones now from American clone type places
or places that were able to get like
[SPEAKER_00]: American hype genetics into the Canadian
scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're like, that's all you see
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they're buying like they're spending a
fortune on like really good breeders work
[SPEAKER_00]: from the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the work is all kind of pushing
towards that direction of this like,
[SPEAKER_00]: same saturated type of thing you're seeing
where it's a lot of beautiful looking,
[SPEAKER_00]: it all looks the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know what I'm talking about,
like the type of structure, the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, the leaf structure,
color, it all looks the same, it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: smokes the same, it looks the same,
smells the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I find it's got like, we consume a lot
of the market just to see like what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we're able to see some of the
clones that come through from the states
[SPEAKER_00]: that are more of these hype clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we've kept some of them short term,
some we just pass on, some friends get it,
[SPEAKER_00]: we smoke that, so we get to experience a
lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just like, it's not something I
really want to consume very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nice, but not something I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree, I just love the old school
stuff that, you know, has more longevity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like that we're all wanting to go
back to our this just continually recycles
[SPEAKER_00]: where I don't know if this will recycle,
it just continues to like, saturate,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, so less constant berry and
constant this and constant that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was talking to Breeder Steve not too
long ago, we did an episode with him and
[SPEAKER_04]: he hit the nail on the head with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, I don't know about you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've grown hands and hundreds of thousands
of plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said all of these 30 percenters
plus, that's when they're all starting to
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of taste the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're getting really high amounts of like
THC in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the dominant that we're
breeding towards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of them are getting that flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your thoughts on the modern
market and what do we have to do to to
[SPEAKER_04]: save it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it's fine as it is?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you think we could better it from
bringing in some older genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think like our market here in
Canada is a great example of what you saw
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado when Colorado illegal is we're
having this inflated THC and like caminoid
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles by like labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's become this competition for
for for customers by lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clients are trying to take on clients
as much as they can or keep clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everything here is inflated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's so many of us that don't even
believe that there's really 30 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: that are kicking around or like obviously
as many that you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you see COAs here that are just
they're laughable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it's just like that's that's
that's a start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to get like good testing and
accurate testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can really we can really get
away from like really like numbers are so
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm a data guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Numbers are so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need them for a lot of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we really want to know about effect
and how that correlates to the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we can get accurate numbers,
then we can start doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see what people want to smoke and
what is consumers like what they what
[SPEAKER_00]: motivates them to purchase stuff,
because that's really the end game for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We we have this whole market guided
towards 30 percenters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's trying to buy 30 percenters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find that I agree if you get real
testing down, like you'll see that
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars that were testing at 20 percent,
rarely breaking 20 percent seven years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: are now well over like 20 percent or 30
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get the accurate testing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree, we can bring in plants that
are really 17 percent TAC plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but have really interesting chamomile
profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that at least we can say like,
hey, you're enjoying a plant that's 17
[SPEAKER_00]: percent or even 13 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's got this interesting chamomile
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you're really enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the way our market works in
Canada, buyers won't even look like you
[SPEAKER_00]: get people requesting on like the buyers
side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, we only want we're
looking for this this large amount from so
[SPEAKER_00]: and so or this sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has to be has to be a way of 28
percent or above TAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can't even enter stuff that's
special into the market right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is maybe 17 percent, like a true 17
percent and that sort of thing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that all has to kind of fall in line
for us to really progress and do something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that is is actually good for this
this kind of legalization thing that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would like to see we're kind of
seeing it because there's more requests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing more requests for like a lot of
the older stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like it's a lot of the people are
kind of coming back or they're realizing
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's a market of connoisseurs that
they can't bring to the dispensaries right
[SPEAKER_00]: now or they can't bring to their brands
that that want the experience of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, if I'm going to buy, you know,
like, let's say San Fernando Valley OJ
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush, like I want it to actually be the
San Fernando Valley OJ Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that when I go buy it right
now, it's going to be some fucking who
[SPEAKER_00]: knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so not only is like accurate lineage
of like said cultivar important going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be important, but also real testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like when those things kind of come in
line, then we can really start entering
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That people will consume because it won't
be about 30% THC or 9% terpenes on a
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, get the fuck out of here,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that barely exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, we're seeing more people
requesting and wanting old stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, which is promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's as much as it's promising,
those two things have to come into line
[SPEAKER_00]: for this to really be something that can
happen because so far still, it's like I
[SPEAKER_00]: want 30 plus percents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see 40% flower, which is like if you
promote that, you should just be like
[SPEAKER_00]: silence.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just ridiculous, ridiculous
promotion.
40%.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been an amazing episode,
Paul.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank you again so much before
your time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we get going here, though,
I want to run through some of these
[SPEAKER_04]: questions from the Patreon members.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: First up, we've got Dank Pandy says,
Do you know the genetics behind the
[SPEAKER_04]: Lindsay OG?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, see, OGs are funny in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens a lot in Canada is an OG will
come from somewheres and it's just fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: renamed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what would happen to the OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of OGs that like that's
unfortunately what happens everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so like stuff like stuff like Lindsay
OG comes from Lindsay, Ontario Liberty
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all credit has to go to Liberty Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just read and research Google
Liberty Farms Canada and you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: they're from Lindsay, Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: I better be fucking right with Ontario or
I'm dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm pretty sure it's on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the Canadian?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Liberty Farms and they've entered
competitions they've won.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no one seems to really know the
lineage of what Lindsay is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's really Cush dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not truly, truly heavily yassy,
but really a beautiful like earthy type
[SPEAKER_00]: OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So special in her own right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still keep her to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the few that still have her because
she had a really high peak of interest and
[SPEAKER_00]: then just fucking died off with the like
cookie cake gelato craze I hit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like she's extinct, but like I still keep
her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally have her in my flower room
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just seated up with some blueberry
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So blueberry OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big Bad John wants to know what male
selection do you have that holds pollen
[SPEAKER_04]: the longest?
[SPEAKER_00]: All I keep right now, I used to have a
decent extensive library of regular males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I only keep two males and I keep one
male is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my pine tar Cush male that comes from
Tom Hale Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that line was found through IC mag
auction through Verdant Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: The preservation work on some Tom Hale
Hayes, Tom Hale Hayes, Tom Hale pine tar
[SPEAKER_00]: Cush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these were F3s and they were like
super rare at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the only male I keep that
regular male and I keep a really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a really special magnum opus male
from aficionado that I really enjoy and
[SPEAKER_00]: like working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the only two males I have
another regulars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but I mean like my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through this period where you do
reading and research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you can't keep males that drop
pollen in bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: She just can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're shitty.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to produce herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't keep a man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a nuisance to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've like over time realized that they
don't all produce shitty like offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them that like do drop pollen,
sometimes drop pollen for just reasons
[SPEAKER_00]: that maybe aren't going to play out in
future lines or future work that are
[SPEAKER_00]: negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just really can't tell if it's bad
or not until you really see it in numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: and in offspring and in combinations,
but in decent numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really my advice on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like don't be scared to keep them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a pain to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have some males that just no matter
what you do, in the past, like the pine
[SPEAKER_00]: tar Kush male, no matter what you do with
that dude, he can like sit and badge.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never drops pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I find over the years of working with
lots and lots and lots of blueberry males,
[SPEAKER_00]: for instance, like years of seeing
blueberry males and holding onto them and
[SPEAKER_00]: like kind of keeping them for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dennis the menace was kind of unique in
the way that he would hold onto his
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even at times of like certain stress
from either drought or needing some more
[SPEAKER_00]: space in his root zone, he would
eventually throw some pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those males, like I said,
I have kept around and I do have some
[SPEAKER_00]: males that hold pollen, like the pine
cart, pine tar Kush male, that guy holds
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I said at the end of the day,
don't worry if some drop pollen and badge,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them or work with them, but just make
sure you know what they do, or at best to
[SPEAKER_00]: your ability, know what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had lots of nails back in the day,
regular males, like lots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a nuisance to to keep lots of those
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just, they're just real estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why like, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just that's why feminized breeding
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, it's not lazy,
but it's just so nice to do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so nice to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done any of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of scared to, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I do, I will hit you up for some
advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just thought it was hilarious that we
had a follow up Patreon question here from
[SPEAKER_04]: Crawdaddy that says, when's Blueberry OG
going to be ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, dude, I've done lots of regular lines
of the Blueberry OG, like lots,
[SPEAKER_00]: because like I said, those are two of my
favorite things to do those profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Blueberry and I love like that's
the only real sweet plant I love is
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we've done lots of regular lines
of Blueberry OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of like the Dennis the Menace,
pollinating Lindsay OG and Roger OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Canadian Blue Blueberry OG lines and
then some of the more American ones as
[SPEAKER_00]: well we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this time around, we're doing some
Winnie the blues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing some like femme Paul and on to
some of these these OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, man, they'll be ready probably in
I mean, as soon as you know, for testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least probably like two, three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely hit it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, love just handing out testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether you grow them or not,
I don't give a shit either, because we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: test them anyway ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got a couple more questions before we get
going.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to give away a couple of packs
of old timer Hayes, old timer one Hayes,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is the old school fucking UK Hayes
with the Winnie the Blue and ATF,
[SPEAKER_04]: the Alaskan Thunderfuck with the Topanga
Canyon OGs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are going to go out to two members.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a pack going out to our free
members.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a fat pack, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You loaded these with seeds, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always do, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Too lazy to count.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's Steve Sweet Skunk crossed with
Dennis the Menace, the old DJ Blueberry
[SPEAKER_04]: from 05.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fun, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a fun line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like you're a new member in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want you to pick a number between one
and ten.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoever is closest will get the pack.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got one minute on that, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Throw a number out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dank Panda wants to know, have you done
any work with the UBC chemo?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but like, obviously, we were,
you know, we were just having a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation about the other day,
me and a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like that, if I can get my hands on a
couple of the older, like I'm pretty happy
[SPEAKER_00]: with the library.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't take much anymore because I'm
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is one that I would always have
an open door for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's hard to find every time I come
across it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had it in clone, like I've had it
sent in cuttings numerous times and one
[SPEAKER_00]: time rooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, two times rooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every time I get it, it's so fucking
like it's so diseased and like so,
[SPEAKER_00]: so, so filthy with with pests and problems
that I just change my mind about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I've progressed over the
years were like out of necessity of just
[SPEAKER_00]: preserving things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take things in that are in the fucking
worse shape and require sometimes a year
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half to just like kind of get to a
state where they get reintroduced into the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual like bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, every time I've ever had my my
luck of getting it, it's been so it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: such a potential issue that I was like,
fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll find it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just never comes back in a state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take it in that I would take it
in now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just hasn't come across my way in
the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Special plant, though, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, are you very familiar with Ramo
at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like everyone knows Remo, he's a
sweetheart, one of the best ambassadors to
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis planting community.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a really, really special human being.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to him a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he probably knows maybe of my of my
brand, but I definitely know him and like
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spoken to him before.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sponsored some of my events,
which is nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was the last one that I had heard from
that really, really seemed to love that
[SPEAKER_04]: UBC chemo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I haven't heard about it really since
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's you have some experience with it
and you back it up with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's it's definitely it's held in D
.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: and in place like it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's held.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like it's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's held very tightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it is on the it's like some
of those plants that like if it wasn't for
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of people holding it,
it definitely would be extinct because
[SPEAKER_00]: people have moved on, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's truly a special medicinal plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're like if you're able to get
your hands on it and you're lucky to
[SPEAKER_00]: consume it, that's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know where grapefruit ranks on
your top strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really special to like another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I, you know, I've had it at
times, but don't have it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last time I was trying to I was trying to
get it into the library was, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe like four years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was through another really good
collective here in Canada that are a
[SPEAKER_00]: really well known group of guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if for some reason it just didn't work
out and I know a couple of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: hold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, it's just one of those
plants like I have a federation,
[SPEAKER_00]: a really old federation, Mikado cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's essentially grapefruit,
you know, because it's essentially like a
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeder Steve line of grapefruit,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's it's really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that does the grapefruit job for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I I've had it tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what it tests out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with it and I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a special cut to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's similar enough to have to not have
to go chase down the the grapefruit cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's you're talking about the sweet pink
grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever had any other styles of
grapefruit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just like I said, the Mikado like
the Mikado is is a special federation,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason, who is next generation seeds now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was Federation seeds before partner and
they had a line that was essentially the
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet pink was used in that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the off screen that pumped
out were very grapefruit dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have a really old school
federation was a staple in Canada and like
[SPEAKER_00]: from the old Emory magazines, like just a
really wicked breeding crew.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jason's a sweet like Jason's amazing
with next gen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, he had the the cutting and used
the cutting and in that subsequent line,
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really awesome grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's kicked out and we have this
amazing cut that was hunted by a really
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome guy out of the Yukon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, you know, he's one of those guys
we were able to return this cut to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's his favorite cut, but it's a great
kind of really dominant grapefruit cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I asked about that because I had a
friend that did a collab with another
[SPEAKER_04]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: One used the sweet pink, one used another
line of grapefruit that they had to kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of bring diversity back to the line
instead of breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very, very heavy on the sweet pink
at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I grew out some of the progeny from
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the sweet pink is fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember growing that back in the
greenhouse days.
[SPEAKER_04]: It threw down pounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't really have to do too much of
it except for like feed it heavy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't really have to do much to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of grew itself really is
beautiful, you know, and everybody knows
[SPEAKER_04]: the sweet pink taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we had one that was, oh, God,
it was a bitch of a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a bitch of a planet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had like two inch inner nodes on it and
it would just throw off really,
[SPEAKER_04]: really small, hard budlets around it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything about it looked like the
grapefruit, except if you stretched out
[SPEAKER_04]: those inner nodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And something about that one, I got rid of
it the first time that I found it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God I went back.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I lost the first time because I just
said, this is a straggly plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody wants to grow this, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did the grower thing and afterwards
found out that it was amazing and
[SPEAKER_04]: regretted every second of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was exactly like the sweet pink,
but it had a bit more sour taste to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever come across anything like
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I always say, like a lot of people
toss runs and I always find that like the
[SPEAKER_00]: runty plants sometimes are the ones that
you already put some focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have found in my days,
like a lot of times you run something that
[SPEAKER_00]: is either like runty or a little bit
finicky in round one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your eye on it because sometimes,
you know, make sure you get a clone of
[SPEAKER_00]: that one for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, like sometimes you're so
busy with the cloning process and keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: things for subsequent next round and
keepers that you are like, ah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the fucking run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry too much about it if it lives
or dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't, man, make sure that run is
cloned and make sure that run will survive
[SPEAKER_00]: because sometimes those runs are special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, I've experienced times where
runs really, really shine and you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: thank God I got a clone of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But grapefruit, like I said, only thing I
really, really enjoy grapefruit wise in my
[SPEAKER_00]: garden because it's sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like sweet, but not a big fan of it
is Federation's macado cut that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's only because of nostalgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Federation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like one of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when I think of seeds, I think of
Federation seeds like Canadian,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Emery magazine just running home
to look at the seed catalog and then
[SPEAKER_00]: putting the order in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were reasonably priced and
everything that that they put out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day like Jason's.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want really good seeds,
Jason from Next Generation, you can find
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really, really, really special
Canadian breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He puts out a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that that stuff is really,
really special.
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody wanted to put an order of
seeds in with you, how would they find
[SPEAKER_00]: you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just really like I said, like I do so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have so much other stuff going on that I
just I don't kind of bother with websites
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a couple distributors and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the best place to really catch me is
like just literally on on like Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I know it's so stupid,
but it's really the best place to catch
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, like you have to be there's
one fake account.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like you have to make sure you
check their page and my page who you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to because my page has got lots of
cannabis pictures on it and theirs is very
[SPEAKER_00]: much not so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just make sure, you know,
you're talking to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can confirm it just by talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see that it's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you check me out here, you'll know the
certain way I talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit much sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a vibe that it's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I'll confirm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will confirm, double confirm with you in
a way that you'll know it's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm unfortunately I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way to get a hold of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one day I'll get a website on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now and I'll look after you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go through the work to find me,
I will look after you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been probably one of my favorite
podcasts in a while, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to say thank you so much for taking
your time to donate these seeds to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we get going, everybody that is a
crew member that's in membership that
[SPEAKER_04]: stuck around to the very end here,
I want you guys to pick a number between
[SPEAKER_04]: four and 20.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to give away two packs here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Alaskan Thunderfuck, the Topanga
Canyon Cross and the Old Timer One Haze
[SPEAKER_04]: with the Winnie the Blue.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to know about your Old Timer One
Haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy you asked because this goes back
to a really special guy that I also have
[SPEAKER_00]: in my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name's, I'll just won't shout him out
full, but his James T.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really solid guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was lucky enough to have some old seeds,
Old Timer One Haze and I was going to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: run and he was like, hey dude,
let's make it a run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I had 12 or 10 and he was like,
he ended up giving me like 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ran a hunt of 40 Old Timer One Haze
in my situation and I have some experience
[SPEAKER_00]: running with some of the Sativa,
so it's not the end of the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: but run a large phenol hunt, narrowed down
to three.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some lab tests on three,
ended up doing, funny enough, I never
[SPEAKER_00]: based on THC, but there was such a large
hunt and so much work involved that I had
[SPEAKER_00]: these three phenols.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went with the highest THC plan out of
all that Old Timer One Haze and I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: hit just around 13%, just a little bit
below 13%, so 12 something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a beautiful structure too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the best ones out of the
whole room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more suitable for the indoor kind
of space that I grew in, not like where
[SPEAKER_00]: they should be growing under full sun,
but that is a phenol that came out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: large hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that goes to James T.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took that female and then we reversed
Winnie the Blue and so you get this really
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful line of like really extreme
expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Winnie's a real true seven to eight
week flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: She can go nine weeks, but she can be
pulled seven and a half, eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have this really extreme line to
hunt through where you get this really
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful haze and expressions which are
quite beautiful with a lot of the shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering Winnie the Blue traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a lot of that kind of like
blueberry haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really fun, fun line to hunt
through and yes, it's for sure legitimate
[SPEAKER_00]: Old Timer One Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much did it bring it down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these hazes went deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were up to, indoor that hunt went deep
and then we did another run for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did our first run for just our hunt,
made our selections that we narrowed down
[SPEAKER_00]: to three or we narrowed down to six,
but we ended up keeping three for future
[SPEAKER_00]: runs and for future work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, those went, I think the longest
went just short of like 19 weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these, some of these like true,
true like wild haze plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were so unruly and big and that was
with like all the training that I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: able to acquire from people over the years
on how to do it right indoor and doing no
[SPEAKER_00]: justice because we all know this should be
grown outdoors in full sun and done well,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is the best I can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, they went up really high
flowering time when he's a shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll get things that are around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most will be in that like 13, 14 week
because when he will really shorten flower
[SPEAKER_00]: time in a row crossing really will take
over flower time and then you'll get some
[SPEAKER_00]: outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously they're going to be shorter,
but most of the outliers will be higher
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering times that will maybe go above
that timeline, but most will be in that
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not too uncontrollable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any tips for people that want
to grow these hazes indoor?
[SPEAKER_04]: How to best control them for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all, like I said,
just things that have been passed on to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is nothing I can take credit for,
but for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of shout outs to rev Charles reefer
man teaching all this sort of knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: passing on for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, man, my trick, my trick is first
and foremost, we always have to agree that
[SPEAKER_00]: they should always be done properly in
full sun and like outdoor proper sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just, you're doing the best you
can with your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these really unruly hazes or some
of the African varieties that go 22,
[SPEAKER_00]: 21 weeks that it's just five varieties
that are just mind blowing Lee long
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing you want to do is you want to
deal with your, uh, your lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure that you're going
into a lighting, uh, lighting kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: environment that is going to be shorter
than your 12 and 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes you want to start at maybe,
you know, you want to do 13 on 11 off for
[SPEAKER_00]: like a period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then slowly reduce as we get closer to
rightness into flower time to ensure you
[SPEAKER_00]: get some sort of rightness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't continually get revenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reducing down to what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can go as low as 10 on like 10
on, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will help, that will help prevent
this massive con like 12 and 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to get flowering to a
point and then it's just going to rebadge,
[SPEAKER_00]: rebadge, rebadge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a real like bummer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making seeds, it's not the end
of the world, but it's still not,
[SPEAKER_00]: not ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's one thing you want to do
before you even start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to realize you want to look
at what these things are going to flower
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's some of those varieties that are
going 20 weeks, be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, like you're going to take like six
months out of your life for these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so plan that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure that this is what we do too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get them started in seeds, get them
transplanted up, you know, as you normally
[SPEAKER_00]: would.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then start getting your topping so you
can get some clones off of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because there's such long flowering
plants, you can kind of cheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I like doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just get them going, get them in a good
pot, upsize, upsize, upsize till they're a
[SPEAKER_00]: foot tall, no more than a foot tall,
even 10 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just fucking put them in your
flower room and start flowering at that
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they flower so long,
they don't really trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't really see flowering traits
until like sometimes 10 weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: 11, 12, 13 weeks, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're just getting these plants that
continually are just getting bigger and
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger and bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can theoretically save time and
planning and just take all your clones off
[SPEAKER_00]: your mothers and do all your, your like
labeling and all that for your,
[SPEAKER_00]: your future keepers and what you're going
to keep in round two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a trick to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way you can kind of maintain and
hack them down a little bit, but it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flip them really early, change the
light cycle, get them in really good pots
[SPEAKER_00]: so that they don't really need a lot of
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Reb said at best, sativas are the
wolves of the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really need a lot of human
intervention, hybrids and indicas or dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of need us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, the sativa, when we grow
it, I put it in really big pots and I let
[SPEAKER_00]: them kind of just do their thing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they're flowering for so long,
lots of basement layering of amendments
[SPEAKER_00]: and then top dressing throughout the whole
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really that's all they're going to
require, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they're going to go so deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that to me, with those methods,
keep some short, keep some manageable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still clone them and save yourself
some time and planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just with the lighting schedule,
they finish indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not, not something that most
people can't do, but it will take some,
[SPEAKER_00]: some, some experience of doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some training, basic training.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I learned a couple of things right
there that I think I might incorporate
[SPEAKER_04]: with some of the tie runs too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was very good advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for that, Paul.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you again for taking time out of
your day.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been an amazing episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I vibe with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I dig where your heart's at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got passion for the plant and that's very
evident.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you take very well care of yourself
and this huge library that you have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you seem like a very amazing person.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad that we crossed paths and I look
forward to hopefully doing another one
[SPEAKER_04]: with you in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like to thank everybody who like
takes time out of their data, like message
[SPEAKER_00]: me, contact me, support me, and a huge
shout out to my family, my wife,
[SPEAKER_00]: my daughter, my family is the only reason
why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So love you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you all had an amazing night.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got two winners.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Alaskan Thunderfuck Topanga Canyon is
going away first to Big Bad John,
[SPEAKER_04]: the number was four.
[SPEAKER_04]: He got closest with five.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations, Big Bad John and the Old
Timer Hayes with the Winnie the Blue.
[SPEAKER_04]: The number was 19 and the closest member
was Crawdaddy was 17.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations, Crawdaddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got yourself some beyond Christmas
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it should be about Christmas right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they'll be done.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much, Paul.
[SPEAKER_04]: Until next time, I hope you all had a
great night.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been Doc Alex with Calix Crew
Podcast saying grow smarter, not harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said get real soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we got what you need,
baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, we got what you need, honey.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, honey.
I said, baby.
I said, baby.
