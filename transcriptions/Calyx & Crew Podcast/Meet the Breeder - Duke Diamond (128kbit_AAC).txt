[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning podcast listeners.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is up everybody?
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to another exciting episode of the
Calyx and crew podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm your host as always Doc Calyx.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very exciting episode today.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Duke is back.

than the man himself, Duke Diamond on the
[SPEAKER_06]: show.
[SPEAKER_06]: Known for his work with heirloom scunks,
Afghanis, the purple Dahlia is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: We used to grow the Munson and the Polecat
91.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those both amazing strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're excited to get in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're excited to talk to them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But before we do, I want to give a quick

[SPEAKER_06]: Now, without further ado, let's learn
about living soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about some of his cultivars.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about his work with organic and
regenerative practices.
[SPEAKER_06]: None other than the Duke himself.
[SPEAKER_06]: After a minor fuck up, we are back with
Duke Diamond of Dominion Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_06]: For the first time in podcast history,
I forgot to hit the recording on Duke's
[SPEAKER_06]: audio, so we've already gone over this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, we're going to pop back on course
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you for your work with your skunks,
your Afghans.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we fucked up that recording,
you were talking about blueberry and how
[SPEAKER_06]: you had got some blueberry.
[SPEAKER_06]: You started growing when you were 13.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're working with skunks.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're working with Afghanis, and then all
of a sudden you're buying blueberry seeds
[SPEAKER_06]: from a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_06]: What were those blueberries that you
really liked?
[SPEAKER_07]: So starting off with the old original
varieties like from my cousins that I grew
[SPEAKER_07]: up and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Skunk's Afghans and our skunk evolves into
later.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you're looking at what's hot,
like the newest of the new.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a real exciting time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We go into the widows and then eventually
we evolve into the years where the
[SPEAKER_07]: blueberry was coming out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you said, you were talking about all
the excitement back then, getting the
[SPEAKER_07]: money ordered, trying to hide and not get
caught.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to get the damn seeds over,
take two months or whatever, and we
[SPEAKER_07]: finally get these blueberry seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: I found good stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't find that crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: People used to call it blueberry yum yum.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like I said, friends, they had a
friend that I guess did, and you got to
[SPEAKER_07]: smoke some of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it was off the charts.
[SPEAKER_07]: But my favorite, favorite one of all time,
blue moonshine, I had a blue moonshine
[SPEAKER_07]: that was like fucking drugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I mean, just so, so strong.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still in my top 10 list of all time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just insane.
[SPEAKER_07]: And unfortunately, that was one of the
ones like he did away with because I
[SPEAKER_07]: talked to him at a show one time and like,
Hey, what's up with that?
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, Oh yeah, bringing it back.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, why would you have ever gotten
rid of it?
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was like, well, it was,
it was a stepping stone.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just a step in a long process.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause you know, DJ, he does a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: He works the shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, he's not in a hurry,
puts the work in, you know, the dude,
[SPEAKER_07]: dude really gets it done.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he was like, yeah, I'm working on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's one thing I got to, I got to
check on, you know, he's like,
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah, it'd be a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm like, all right, well, it's been a
couple of years for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a long year.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know you haven't been going out and
about socializing and partying.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's up with that blue moonshine
dude?
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was supposed like, I remember the
description.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like the blue side of the widow
family or the white or he called it the
[SPEAKER_07]: white family.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I know it's so much white widows
and, uh, my God, like a little cush
[SPEAKER_07]: plants, all like super, super dark purple,
almost black and just this pungent.
[SPEAKER_07]: It smelled purple.
[SPEAKER_07]: If that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it was like the epitome of the
smell purple.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so pungent, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like chemical pungent funk.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: It grew awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just the potency of it was just
knockout.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did it take more after those moonshine
traits or did it take more after the blue
[SPEAKER_06]: traits?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, uh, I can't really honestly speak
on it because I never had his,
[SPEAKER_07]: what he would call like a pure moonshine
or any of that, but whatever, whatever
[SPEAKER_07]: that project was, I mean, it was like,
if you had like the most gnarly of the
[SPEAKER_07]: blueberry type funks, but more like I
said, just the color purple, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the selling point.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh dude, it was, it was just ridiculous,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I said, it's so potent,
just knockout shit, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like that was, that was my all time
favorite, you know, delving into those
[SPEAKER_07]: lines.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I agree that I grew the great
crush.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I was, uh, when I grew it was,
uh, it's her Hayes, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried that one, but yeah, nothing like
that blue moonshine was, oh, that's 13
[SPEAKER_07]: homies forgot about that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, uh, yeah, nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing like that blue moonshine though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I don't hear you talk about
some of your favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I've heard you talk about a lot
of your cultivars very often, but we don't
[SPEAKER_06]: hear very much about like what you like.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a big part of growing is like
you're taking other people's stock and
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to find stuff out of that too,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the thing is like, some guys
are just like all about, Oh, I like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me get seed breeder A and seed
breeder B.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm just going to sling it together
and I'm going to sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never been really that type of dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do my work and then other people's work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's their work and I like their
work.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's, it's a done deal for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to grow it and grow it and
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But unfortunately, when you really get
into breeding and stuff, man, all your
[SPEAKER_07]: space and all your time's taken up with it
as far as delving into like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Newer things that people make,
it was all like taking a back burner for
[SPEAKER_07]: like retirement day or something,
you know, and then I'm going to jump into
[SPEAKER_07]: those, but there was a lot of stuff that I
liked, you know, just like to grow and
[SPEAKER_07]: just, you know, smoke it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there were just clones that were in
the, in the room and it's like,
[SPEAKER_07]: all right, well, I need some more of this
weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, well, I'm testing out these,
you know, a bunch of these beans that I
[SPEAKER_07]: just made and at the back, back corner,
I'll have a whatever just to replenish.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I feel like it's fair to say,
though, out of everything that you
[SPEAKER_06]: appreciate, you're more into the gassy,
skunky, rotten type offensive shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Would that be right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I like and I have such an
appreciation for all of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I tend to go toward things that
sour chem type funk.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's typically the way my my
hand always goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: But equally to that, I do like those like
really, really potent purples and like
[SPEAKER_07]: those hash plants is really narcotic hash
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's definitely something I wanted to
talk to you about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that's another big one for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then like when I'm talking like hazes
and, you know, shit like that,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, that's it's a whole nother,
you know, frankincense funk like,
[SPEAKER_07]: man, honestly, man, really, I'm all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, you know, when it comes to the
evening time and the nighttime,
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah, it's like it's going more toward
that, you know, what people say,
[SPEAKER_07]: like the gassy side of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going toward those real narcotic hash
plants that have more.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, some of them are like that,
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: But my favorite one was more they said in
that purple flavored realm of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: So speaking on hash plants back in the
day, I told you earlier, two of the ones
[SPEAKER_06]: that we grew from you that we loved were
the Monson and the most memorable for me
[SPEAKER_06]: is the Polcat 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_06]: That Polcat 91 that had skelly hash plant
in it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And see skelly hash plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard the puck a million times,
but that was a little bit beyond my time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the only thing that I've had it in
is your Polcat 91.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you tell us a little bit more about
Skelly and what made that hash plant so
[SPEAKER_06]: popular and wanted?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So normally out there, like especially in
the breeding world and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_07]: or like the people that might not be
breeding, but they're like the extreme
[SPEAKER_07]: growers actually keep track of all the
genetics being made and sold and
[SPEAKER_07]: everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anytime there's anything out there or
anybody says, no, man, you can't have it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes them go fucking wild.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's literally all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I even joke with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The old dealer's trick.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you can't have it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have that jar, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll fucking make something.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to grow it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So pictures about how awesome it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when people are like, Oh, I want to
see, like, nah, no, you can't smoke people
[SPEAKER_07]: down.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't have it enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then people will go wild.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then all you got to do is let one
clone out to somebody.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, who's going to give it away.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when you do that, whatever you
do, don't give it to anybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And within the year, it should be in like,
you know, 10,000 different hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then at that point, that's when you
drop the seeds and then you just cash out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, you know, that,
that would be just the ultimate.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to show like fucking Duke dropping
tips.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, I mean, there's that,
but all that aside, it is super,
[SPEAKER_07]: super, super fucking dang, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of those hash plants that leads
on, but leans on that just rotten,
[SPEAKER_07]: gassy, nasty, or rag type type side of
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Extremely potent.
[SPEAKER_07]: That just slow as shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Barely even stretches when you flower it,
but man, it's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I was talking to Mike and
everything and his, you know, the dude
[SPEAKER_07]: that originally got the seeds over in
Holland and they came back with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, hidden in a sign into a sweater and
all that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, uh, cause they, they got it or
whatever before, since he was doing the
[SPEAKER_07]: shit with Neville.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it should have been, uh, Neville's,
uh, hash plant stock.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which would, I think it was like an L2 and
L2 and L1 and something else.
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, my brain's been a little,
a little hazy here lately.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you got the power of the internet,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You can look up the old C bank catalogs
and being brains could correct me to,
[SPEAKER_07]: he even sent me like old catalogs with her
at home.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I remember it was like a heavy,
you know, an old base.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, anyways, they come over here,
they're growing it and, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: it stood the test of time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And typically anything that's that old and
stands the test of time, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: there's a, there's a damn good reason for
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So having that heavy, you know,
base.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a one good reason.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just the fact that it just,
it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it's got what, uh, what I like and
what I want.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other side to it is like my own
personal beliefs, you know, like I've
[SPEAKER_07]: heard a billion and one stories about Kim
from here, Kim from there, Kim from here
[SPEAKER_07]: and from there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've always believed that Kim is a
derivative of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So sticking with that, uh, that gut,
I always saw it there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, well, maybe it was like an L
skunk that was, you know, producing that
[SPEAKER_07]: hit it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and that's, you know, the derivative.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I felt like, all right, if I'm going to
work in this gene pool, I want to
[SPEAKER_07]: encapsulate as much as I can of,
of that into this hybrid, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is going to be gnarly funk and
really good potency.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was the, that was kind of the
starting point of, um, of doing that,
[SPEAKER_07]: that, that whole, that whole project.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that way, eventually I have a dominion
skunk male.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, you know, it was a, it was a
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_07]: It had, you know, all the, all the,
the core genes in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I could use that to start,
to start hitting anything that was,
[SPEAKER_07]: that was Kim.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I did another project that was,
I was trying to hit any, basically
[SPEAKER_07]: anything Kim OG with it, which was a
figure four male.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, I wanted to have those,
those things and work them to the,
[SPEAKER_07]: to the way where I'm, I'm keeping the
funk, I'm keeping the, uh, I'm keeping
[SPEAKER_07]: that the good qualities that gene pool,
good, strong branching and everything to,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, go along with that red potency
and really good gnarly nose on everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was kind of, kind of that whole
project to finally hit that, hit that end
[SPEAKER_07]: goal and the pole cat and then the pole
cat DX.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're definitely, definitely up there on
the, uh, on the, on the charts with the
[SPEAKER_07]: nose and the potency and everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it worked out pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really missed that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta say that was by far one of my
favorite outdoor plants of all time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We would top.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a patron member ask me earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: They heard about your tips on high stress
training, low stress training,
[SPEAKER_06]: and they wanted to know like, if there's
certain cultivars that you recommend a
[SPEAKER_06]: certain amount of training on or a certain
type of training.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they said they had a pole cat out
crossing from you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think he mentioned what cross it
was, but I said, if it's anything like the
[SPEAKER_06]: original pole cat and you're doing it
outdoors, top at once, super crop,
[SPEAKER_06]: the lowers, and then just keep everything
even.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's going to produce like hell for
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, for sure, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's like another little tip for
like anybody growing out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was something that, you know,
I learned this early on growing out
[SPEAKER_07]: different things, especially when you're
growing from clothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Say like, you know, our first go around,
we're just like, all right, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: we're just going to, uh, we're just going
to go for the, for the, for the topic.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you top it and, you know, everything's
kind of little, but let's say like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you don't, you don't, you don't call it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You go again, and this time you super
crop, you know, so, oh wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: All the, all the flowers are like really
big.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some things don't respond well to like the
multicola type training.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like a good example of it was the 88
G13 hash plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you super crop it a little bit and get
the lower branches to kind of come up
[SPEAKER_07]: toward the top and keep them about four to
six inches below the apex of it,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the very tip of the top,
you would do great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if you pinched it again and got
everything even, or if you topped it early
[SPEAKER_07]: on, your yield would go down below half of
what you would have got.
[SPEAKER_07]: And those growth options, which are the,
what it's turned into the apex,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, says like, you get the most,
you get the lion's share of my energy
[SPEAKER_07]: right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you have to divvy it up across a
whole bunch of different types,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's like some of these plants,
like they just get confused or something,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, they get a little worked up over
it and you don't end up getting it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, some plants, you can have 12 tops and
you're going to get 12 equally large colas
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's going to do very well for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then some of them, it does nothing,
or some cases it even did.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did worse.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I always say is like, when you
grow out, when you grow out from seed,
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of go not all natural, but just,
you know, do the, do the super crop and
[SPEAKER_07]: enough to where you're getting the lowers
up near the top and do your first run like
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Find your winner.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then once you got that and you're
going to move forward and now it's the
[SPEAKER_07]: next run, you know, try like one clone,
you know, top one clone super crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like, like you normally would,
and then do another one, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: with multiple tops, you know, five,
six, 10, however many tops you want and
[SPEAKER_07]: see how it responds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then that way you're kind of dialing it
in, you know, how, how you're going to
[SPEAKER_07]: have your space management go down.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that way, you know, you can
predictably say, okay, well, I might need,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, this much square footage for
each one of these plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to give me, give or take
about this amount.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it responds what best in this way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, do that at the same time as
you would, you know, dialing in your feeds
[SPEAKER_07]: and also like your, your chop times too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause my first few runs, I play around,
give or take a couple of days before,
[SPEAKER_07]: during, and after to really, really dial
in that, that, that chop date,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, to see if that potency really
spikes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause some things, man, they have like a
little short window where shit really,
[SPEAKER_07]: really spikes and peaks very high.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great and potent before and after,
but there's these little windows where
[SPEAKER_07]: should it make you snot drop sweat?
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, that's ultimately,
we want the best possible, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So play around with these things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that way you, you know,
something you're going to keep,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, you, you really got that thing
dialed down.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're making the best of your,
your space management and you're getting
[SPEAKER_07]: the best possible outcome at the end,
you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, that's a perfect tip for new growers
right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take that same clone that you like grow it
in as many ways possible and see how it
[SPEAKER_06]: responds best.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mind your six peas, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Proper planning prevents this poor
performance.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pulling for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another thing that you talk about is
something that I talked to my patrons
[SPEAKER_06]: about very often.
[SPEAKER_06]: You say it a little bit different than me.
[SPEAKER_06]: You talk about reading a plant sign
language, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, obviously they can't speak.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if the plants does start talking to
you and you're hearing, I language and you
[SPEAKER_07]: might want to put the mushrooms and come.
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was speaking fucking clay on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it makes it out, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, so I always kind of related it to
like, you know, they can't verbally speak,
[SPEAKER_07]: but they can speak through your sign
language.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's up to us to know the best way to,
to understand that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would kind of like, relate it to if
you've known somebody long enough and you
[SPEAKER_07]: notice like they look a certain way or act
in a certain way that they might be hungry
[SPEAKER_07]: or hot or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like the same, like social cues,
like you use with another human being and
[SPEAKER_07]: more in particular human being,
like that you hang around a lot,
[SPEAKER_07]: you might notice a little subtle,
subtle little thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So same type deal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, know what, know what your
deficiencies look like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Know what your toxicities look like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Understand about light sensitivity and
know what 100% super healthy looks like.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can, you can kind of have a,
have a gauge, a gauge on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that way you're knowing like,
you know, the, the perfect sweet spots for
[SPEAKER_07]: like watering.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause you know, if you're doing your soul
thing, um, I noticed like a lot of people
[SPEAKER_07]: over over water, like has like a huge,
huge problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: So not over watering and knowing like the
right amount to give them for like what
[SPEAKER_07]: they need for that period in time and
knowing when to give it to them,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and, and looking at the angle of
how the leaves are pointed up or flat or
[SPEAKER_07]: less than parallel with the floor.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when they start to come down
past that point, knowing, knowing these
[SPEAKER_07]: little things and knowing what,
you know, uh, you know, yellow leaves
[SPEAKER_07]: starting at the bottom are knowing what a
little rough spot is become familiar with
[SPEAKER_07]: all these things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And essentially you're learning their
language, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that way, you know how to better
handle your problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: If there is a problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then once you start to learn these,
uh, these different things, know how to
[SPEAKER_07]: deal with them accordingly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, if you're an organic road,
know how to do it organically and don't
[SPEAKER_07]: limit yourself to knowing like,
Oh, I need a bottle of whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, like, you know,
there's a, there's a bunch of ways,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, like one could even get cast
them out of a buddy that, uh, in a pen,
[SPEAKER_07]: she crushed up a bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh damn.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually fucking Jesus.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, you know, if you're in a pinch
and a lot of that, you know, it comes from
[SPEAKER_07]: growing up in an illegal world where I
can't go to a grocery store.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna get fucking indicted.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I go to this grocery store,
you know, like I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't order things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to be able to make your own
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that knowledge came from there,
but you know, there's, there's a whole
[SPEAKER_07]: bunch of different ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the thing is like, you might
have this goldmine lime that you'd have,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, made a slurry with and broke it
down some microbes and shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now you're, you're using that,
but you know, you might not be able to get
[SPEAKER_07]: out and he was like, Oh man, I need to
need a little, little calcium booster real
[SPEAKER_07]: quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you don't have any, but you know,
it's really needed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you're out in the dunes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a while before you can
get out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey man, you saw a roll, a roll of fucking
Tom's, you know, and you're like,
[SPEAKER_07]: all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you, you could potentially use
that, you know, so there's, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of, I wouldn't recommend it or of course,
you know, but if you had to, you,
[SPEAKER_07]: you had an alternative.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like no, in a pinch when in Rome,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, you gotta, you gotta know,
know your alternatives and, and things
[SPEAKER_07]: like that, like rare rabbit molasses,
for instance, shit ton of calcium in that
[SPEAKER_07]: shit ton of calcium in that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they give you, give you a little boost
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got some iron and some other goodies
in there as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, just be well versed in,
uh, what to do according to what this
[SPEAKER_07]: plant is trying to tell you, you know what
I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, the more, you know,
right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: The more you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, no, that's, I, I love how you explain
that because that's a big thing that I
[SPEAKER_06]: tell my patrons.
[SPEAKER_06]: I call it reading your plants and it's,
it's basically exactly how you described
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say watering practices are the
number one, killer of plants for new
[SPEAKER_06]: growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the hardest thing for them to learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: But after that, it's just understanding
mobile and immobile nutrients,
[SPEAKER_06]: understanding what your nutrients are and
what they do for your plant, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your environmental.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and the one other big one I would add
to it is understanding the difference
[SPEAKER_07]: between plant available and not available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Things that can be taken up and then
things that really need to be broken down
[SPEAKER_07]: and what it takes to break those down.
[SPEAKER_07]: So knowing that will also help with,
you know, doing, doing things,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's also going to help you with,
uh, you know, another thing I've always
[SPEAKER_07]: said with growing, especially myself,
which was weird as fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the, like the, the horse and the
carrot, you got to push them a little bit,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, to get them to do, to exactly
what you want to really, really excel.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to lead them along and you
need to know why things happen and what
[SPEAKER_07]: causes these things to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that way you can say, okay,
well, if higher UV light is going to
[SPEAKER_07]: trigger a response for, for more oil
production, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: We can say, okay, well, we can give it
more UV, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we need to know how can we best
facilitate this?
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we know how to trigger.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we need to know how to facilitate
that.
Right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you know, like, okay, well now it's
about that time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to crank the lights up a
little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I'm going to start feeding it
something for a little more oil production
[SPEAKER_07]: and understand that it's kind of like a,
not like a super stress, but it's like a
[SPEAKER_07]: stress response.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, when they're stressed,
they produce a little bits of salicylic
[SPEAKER_07]: acid.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's help them out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's use like alley water, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's got a shit ton of salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's facilitate the stress.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stress response, what they need to produce
more oil and, you know, trigger it and
[SPEAKER_07]: deliver.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that way, you know, with all
these other little things, you can kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: lead them along the path that you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's definitely a great tip.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, is fucking understanding plant
stages and what they're using at those
[SPEAKER_06]: different stages.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're also a big no-till organic guy,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?
[SPEAKER_06]: What got you into that?
[SPEAKER_06]: You've tried hydro, haven't you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your hydro back in the day because of.
[SPEAKER_07]: Allegedly, allegedly, I love that word.
[SPEAKER_07]: I say that one a lot of legend.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so it's like, you know, to go to a
bunch of a bunch of different places that
[SPEAKER_07]: are all over state like it's just not
feasible.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to have things automated and.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was like the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we've done, you know,
you're in a dripper, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: draining drained waste and recycles doing
rock pool and cocoa, Evan flow and hydro
[SPEAKER_07]: corals, you know, my buddy used to call it
a hydra.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clay pellets, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've grown about every, every way you can
think, but grown in Seoul without a
[SPEAKER_07]: dollar.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always got my, my best quality and I
wasn't really sacrificing much on the
[SPEAKER_07]: yield department.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just, I'm not into smoking rock hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: He just doesn't burn good for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not, I'm not, because like the
thing is like, Oh, it's black ash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, like, I mean, you do have the
products correctly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it'd have a white ash, but.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's just, wasn't, wasn't,
wasn't my jam flavonoids, terpenes
[SPEAKER_07]: weren't, weren't there like they were in
the school.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might, you know, I'm going to finish a
little bit quicker.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: But man, if I'm already going,
you know, 60 something days or whatever,
[SPEAKER_07]: like, you know, a few handful of days,
ain't, ain't going to hurt me when it
[SPEAKER_07]: comes to, you know, the quality of the end
product.
[SPEAKER_07]: And ultimately for me, that was my,
you know, that's, that's my, that's my
[SPEAKER_07]: jam, you know, so back in those days,
early days of alleged pumping,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, it was, it was fine,
but it was just out of, out of that
[SPEAKER_07]: necessity and that necessity only.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, like for me personally,
and especially the way the world is today,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's like, I don't, I don't have those
worries.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I can, I can just do my soul
thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So aside from the quality and shit,
just the ease of it, man, just the,
[SPEAKER_07]: the, the flat out ease of growth.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cheaper.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just easier all the way around,
you know, and especially like after the
[SPEAKER_07]: first run, you know, you've, you know,
you've already paid for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, and then it's rock and roll
and it, and it again, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: if the, if the soul is really,
really set up for that, as far as like the
[SPEAKER_07]: no-till is like, yeah, I'm not definitely
not telling, but when somebody said that
[SPEAKER_07]: to me years ago, I was like, yeah,
yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, Oh, what cover crops are
you running?
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, Oh no, I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing my thing inside.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, Oh yeah, yeah, we know what
cover crops here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, Oh, I don't do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, what about your mulch layer?
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, well, I stripped down the
lower third of my plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I messed it up with scissors and I
picked that up and then I'll throw some
[SPEAKER_07]: Bokashi on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe some earthworm castings and let it
go to town.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that does, that does pretty awesome,
but I don't, I don't grow, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: another, another crop crop on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just, that's just my style.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I've tried it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just adding, adding to my,
adding to my workload.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just mulching with my, when I'm
stripping, you know, that was always good
[SPEAKER_07]: enough for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And every now and again, I'm top dressing
a few things just to keep levels of
[SPEAKER_07]: certain things up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not real big on overloading the soil,
like with everything in existence,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, a lot of those things,
like I really want to keep in my control.
[SPEAKER_07]: So some guys would.
[SPEAKER_07]: Throw it down, shit tons of alfalfa and
kelp.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they're like, you know,
right into the mix and come in and it kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of smells like fucking green grass and
burns my throat.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, that's that right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, you know, something it's
not mentioning on that bag of whatever
[SPEAKER_07]: that you're dumping in is the,
you know, the plant growth regulators,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, they're organic, you know,
but the, uh, you know, there's PGRs that
[SPEAKER_07]: are, that are in there, you know,
so, uh, try can't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the alfalfa is giving you that nice
green grass, fucking funk through it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that's the feeling.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's sodium.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now the kelp's really, uh, really doing it
up for you on the, on the smoothness,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, don't, don't load your shit
down with everything under the sun.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have it in your room, but like,
you know, brew it, make a tea,
[SPEAKER_07]: use it when it's needed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can make it available and you can
give it then.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just because it's good and veg and
you're going to bloom, don't feed that
[SPEAKER_07]: shit through the whole bloom cycle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you're inhibiting a lot of,
a lot of things doing it too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then it goes back to like educating
yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, why does this do what it does?
[SPEAKER_07]: And what is actually going on other than
like, Oh, it worked.
[SPEAKER_07]: It did good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Plant looked happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like, no, like the beginner
grower notes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember taking those notes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Watered.
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plant green, plant happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plant green, plant good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm a big organic guy too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't fucked around with Hydro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm one of the only organic growers I know
that's never touched Hydro in his life.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I went from using like a mostly
organica and organic, like bald nutrient
[SPEAKER_06]: system.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was horrible.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was that they had like fucking eight,
13 balls or some shit like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went from that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: The pH down.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the worst.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the worst.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Three drops.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're way the fuck out now.
[SPEAKER_06]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like lemon juice, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'm using lemon juice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeez.
[SPEAKER_06]: But before I moved into top dressing and
after that, I really got into K and F
[SPEAKER_06]: practices.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, very, very familiar, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: It works.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's those books.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That are available to the public for
anybody listening.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not some secret.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like she get those, learn those and
understand why those things are doing
[SPEAKER_07]: good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the same thing like with Tom's or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, no, like you can find nutrients
literally all over the place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, you know, fermenting them or,
you know, breaking them down and other
[SPEAKER_07]: other ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's there, you know, and you can really
do some bullshit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have a couple of questions for you on
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went from using K and F and every run I
would take my soil out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would reamend it like you were saying,
just throw it in there because it's good
[SPEAKER_06]: for bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I'm getting bigger pots.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm growing in beds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm trying to do the no till hand in
hand, incorporate with the K and F.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you getting your soil tested after
each run?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you gauge it?
[SPEAKER_05]: What type of organic growing are you using
in conjunction with your no till?
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as like testing goes for the
longest time, that was just.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just not a practical thing that was going
to happen for me out here, especially like
[SPEAKER_07]: when the CBD shift went super crazy and
that's okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's, you know, it's all legit and
everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: You started getting a lot of these ag
companies that were coming out and like,
[SPEAKER_07]: oh yeah, we'll test your soul,
test your soul.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at that point, that's when I was like,
okay, yeah, I can, I can test this
[SPEAKER_07]: because, you know, like I'm at the end of
the day, like I'm a scientist.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might not look at her sounded,
but I want to quantify shit and know what
[SPEAKER_07]: exactly is going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I did get to see, you know,
my levels and, you know, what would
[SPEAKER_07]: deplete.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it wasn't incredibly far off from what
I kind of already knew.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, but I had like a tangible actual
number with it now that, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: I could, I could really hone in with
versus me just.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, just looking at the plants in
the past and being like, well,
[SPEAKER_07]: every run, you know, and on the second,
you know, another run, I noticed like,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm starting to Peter out here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I need to start adding, you know,
this or the other.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, if it, if it's available to you
and you can do it, I would definitely
[SPEAKER_07]: highly advise that because, you know,
we want to, we want to be the best at,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, what we're, what we're trying to
do as far as my soul pots, like beds are
[SPEAKER_07]: really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the only, I guess, downside of it to
me was if something happens, so if for
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever ungodly reasons, say Pythium were
to come into the mix, I don't want that
[SPEAKER_07]: spreading across the whole bed and losing
everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I didn't happen and notice it in a
plant, you know, I could at least take
[SPEAKER_07]: that pot and remove it out of the,
out of the area and, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: be done with it without doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And pots offered me a little bit of
configurability where I could,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, arrange things and move around.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but I mean, beds are, they are cool,
you know, but it's just, uh, for me,
[SPEAKER_07]: I needed to have that little versatility
as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as my pots, once I, once I set them
up, I don't, I never bust them up again,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I found out like growth stones ain't
around anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm gonna have to go back to like
comments and shit like that, I guess
[SPEAKER_07]: again, but.
[SPEAKER_07]: Paralite breaks down mad quick though.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the important part about people that I
noticed like when they were doing these
[SPEAKER_07]: like big, big, huge 20 something gallon
no-till pots and work beds for that matter
[SPEAKER_07]: is that aeration wise, they were just
relying a lot on the Paralite and it's
[SPEAKER_07]: going to break down fairly quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you're going to start losing your
aeration, which is going to invite,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, problems and the plants are
going to start to suffer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure like when you set your pot or
your bed up and make sure that it is,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, it's set up good to go for,
for the long haul sizing wise on my pots.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just, I kind of just kind of honed it
in over trial and error over a long time
[SPEAKER_07]: was the plant that I want about the,
we'll just say diameter times height there
[SPEAKER_07]: equal pot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, plant, plant happy plant good.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was like a small, say like a waist
high belly button plant, five gallons,
[SPEAKER_07]: seven gallons full chest high,
chin highs, you know, maybe a little
[SPEAKER_07]: taller, you know, 10 gallon to 15
depending on, cause some things have the
[SPEAKER_07]: crazy insane root systems that just want
to go bonkers, you know, and other things
[SPEAKER_07]: they, they don't, they don't quite have
that, that vigor in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like some cultivars do.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, that play it, play it by
here with the, with the cultivar as well,
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of try to cater individually instead
of like, all right, you're all cannabis,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, y'all all act the same,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, no, no, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: They all got their dietary needs and
tweaks and shit and things that I do like,
[SPEAKER_07]: don't like.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me ask you another question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something we've been talking about in my
discord server with my patrons was keeping
[SPEAKER_06]: a no till in a certain size.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had always heard, don't do it in
anything under a 15 gallon.
[SPEAKER_06]: A big reason of that is that dry downtime,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And keeping that biodiversity going.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you suggest for like the
smallest pot size that you could get a
[SPEAKER_06]: no-till system in with?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what it really boils down to is
the one, the person and how attentive and
[SPEAKER_07]: how much you're there, you know,
in your, in your garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the second thing being like,
when we go back to the, to the plan itself
[SPEAKER_07]: and that root zone bigger.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause like, if I got something,
I know that just has this crazy root zone.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I already know that, you know,
week four flower is starting to suck water
[SPEAKER_07]: up so damn quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know better than to try to grow this big
bastard on a 10 or seven.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know like, Hey, you definitely need
to be in a 15.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some things you can get away with,
with a, with a 10.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, that's, that's the whole key is
like keeping these microbes happy,
[SPEAKER_07]: letting them build their infrastructure,
their highways and byways, their living,
[SPEAKER_07]: living spaces and all in places where
they're reproducing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta concentrate on them because
they're like in your industrial assembly
[SPEAKER_07]: line plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's job is to send food to the roots.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're your workers and you got to keep
your workers.
[SPEAKER_07]: The better they do, the better that
plant's going to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as you make sure they're happy in
their environment and they have what they
[SPEAKER_07]: need to succeed, then they're,
they're, they're going to take care of the
[SPEAKER_07]: rest for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't, yeah, I think with most
people, definitely like, I mean,
[SPEAKER_07]: if you want to push the envelope and go
back and forth, sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I think, you know, 15 would be a
good proper size for most people that
[SPEAKER_07]: might not be able to, you know,
they might work two jobs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, you know, you know, life gets swept up
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think 15 would be a good place caveat
to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: People with big 15s, they start fucking
water and like just transplanted,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, like you water it down and you
get it good and good and down.
[SPEAKER_07]: You put in a Dixie cup clone, you know,
and you watered it in, but everybody wants
[SPEAKER_07]: to water the whole fucking pot again.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't throw in the kids in the pool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, you know, it's just dry.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not dried out, but it's starting to
dry in the immediate area of the
[SPEAKER_07]: transplant.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the rest of the pot was good.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just needed to wet out the
circumference of that area again and
[SPEAKER_07]: maintain a good moisture, moisture level
as it's starting to go along.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause as it comes more to a dry,
not dry, but you know, it's, it's running
[SPEAKER_07]: out of these, this moisture.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what roots do.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the horse and the carrot thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to kind of go there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or else the roots are going to get
complacent.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll just stay right there and not search
for water.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like it needs to come down a level for
it to search for it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you need to reward it with some
carrot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, you do it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what's causing that root system to
go.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's looking for moisture and being fed.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how she goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if it takes a gallon of water,
say to wet down the spot real good and
[SPEAKER_07]: then you transplant and it's good and
happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, when you water again, you don't need
to hit it with another gallon.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you're probably good with,
you know, 40 ounces of water or something
[SPEAKER_07]: like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's another one that I noticed
because then they're just like,
[SPEAKER_07]: oh yeah, the roots are in it and they
should.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is never happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this always droopy all the time?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you're waterboarding it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't have any government secrets,
brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: You water boarded it for nothing,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I need to smoke a bowl really quick,
but before we get going to break,
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to ask you, has there been one
input, one tip, one major piece of advice
[SPEAKER_06]: that has really changed or grow for the
better?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been so many, so many little things
that really did it one thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I could even put it down to
just this one thing, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so, so many things, but hey,
I guess that means that we got,
[SPEAKER_07]: we got more to talk about then.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: All those little things that you reach for
that people give you advice over,
[SPEAKER_06]: you try them, they work for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: All that stuff adds up to what your style
of growing is, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, I think, I think the biggest
thing, you know, it's not one thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the idea that I don't have to throw
my soil away anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can regenerate this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can not only help my plants,
I can help my pocket.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can help the planet all at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I could ride with that being one of those
things because, you know, way back in the
[SPEAKER_07]: day, I used to toss mine out and he said,
cause root balls, I throw them in the
[SPEAKER_07]: garden where I was growing, you know,
watermelons, tomatoes and shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had like that one section where shit
was this bonkers feel at my end.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a real good soul down there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They must be watching all going down there
to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I reckon so.
[SPEAKER_07]: I reckon so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, you throw that shit in the
trash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then, you know, you got the, you got the.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chance of them seeing that shit unless you
throw it in like a fucking abandoned
[SPEAKER_06]: dumpster somewhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, man, yeah, in the country.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was talking to gas from Swami Organic
Seed, and that's one of the things that he
[SPEAKER_06]: was talking about, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: He used to throw his soil away back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things that we both know is
because that's a place where you can throw
[SPEAKER_06]: soil where nobody's going to question why
is there soil there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: The one time where I just said,
fuck it.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a role again, just for shits and
giggles, just to see what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was better.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was better than the first round.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what triggered it in my head.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we were saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're throwing that through that soil in
our gardens.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of a sudden we noticed our fucking
tomatoes are happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our fucking plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like this isn't trash made of red tomato.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to take a short break.
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right back with Duke Diamond from Dominion
Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: G'day, everyone.

[SPEAKER_00]: Now back to Doc and Duke to finish off the
session.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we're back with Duke Diamond
from Dominion Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to talk more about your
cultivars now, some of the stuff that
[SPEAKER_06]: you've made in the past that you're really
happy about.
[SPEAKER_06]: My help over on the podcast, Grow Green
Daddy, one of the questions he likes me to
[SPEAKER_06]: ask you guys all the time is if you had
like a, let's shoot for one, but you can
[SPEAKER_06]: take a top three cultivars that you've
made that you want to represent your name
[SPEAKER_06]: when you're gone, what would they be?
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say definitely the Dominion G,
the six mil, god damn top three.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a hard question, so okay,
take your time, take your time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna say screaming eagle in there
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And with that Dominion G, it's like my
polecat Dominion G projects, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: like those were oh man, they're good ones,
you know, so, but yeah, that would
[SPEAKER_07]: probably be it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The screaming eagle one was a big one too.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the difference between the
Dominion G and the Capital G?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the Cap G was just the first,
the first attempt, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna make this and we're gonna see
what happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of nasty, nasty funk resulted from
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was like 40 packs, something
like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people were just fucking trying to
fucking just, I thought I was gonna get
[SPEAKER_07]: raped or something the way people were
fucking creeping on me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, just take them, you know,
it's like, it's not a done deal,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I've already had my selection.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already made a step, you know,
in the process.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I already know like, even if they tried
some fuck boy shit, which I know is gonna
[SPEAKER_07]: happen anyway, cause I've been doing this
a while, there's no way in hell they'd
[SPEAKER_07]: catch up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I left that out,
but you know, the ultimate goal was to,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, refine it further and further,
further along into the Dominion G and
[SPEAKER_07]: having like a really just same thing with
the, the, the pole cat, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: having that nasty, that Kim skunk blend on
the, on the nose and just knock down kick
[SPEAKER_07]: ass potency and just good, well structured
plants that weren't floppy or anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and stuff that was good and
already that, you know, you could grow it
[SPEAKER_07]: into or outdoor and not finicky.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the Hills and the cold, yeah,
they can, they can take it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can definitely take it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my favorite was growing it up in
the mountains when it was all cold and
[SPEAKER_06]: shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would just get thick, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those branches would be like arms by far.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my favorite, another big thing
about something you talked about was when
[SPEAKER_06]: you're curing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You leave about like one or two inches on
your pedals, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, that's been a huge thing for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: That has helped me out so much with my
grill.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it really, really helps with that,
with the drying process, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it keeps things more consistent,
you know, so you're not drying up in one
[SPEAKER_07]: spot and not the other nice consistent
drying.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it acts as like, like kind of acts as
like a wick almost, you know, just kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: slowly and surely just evenly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Displacing that, that moisture that we're
trying to get rid of, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah, I do turn me onto that back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, yeah, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, he found out by accident too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, you know, I remember it was his
old lady or his daughter or what,
[SPEAKER_07]: but just helping him do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this wasn't using scissors.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a snip, snip, snip.
[SPEAKER_07]: So something left it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was like, Oh no, you can just break
them off and just leave it by the branch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, yeah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he had all the ones that they'd
done like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: They noticed like, wow, that made a
substantial difference there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then he started doing it on purpose and
turned me on to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, I'll be done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, before that, I was doing a whole
plant hang.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would leave on all the fan leaves and
everything like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really, I mean, it was OK if you
had a couple of plants in there with
[SPEAKER_06]: really good airflow.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, you got that thing packed after
like an outdoor harvest or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, Jesus Christ, there's so much
moisture in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would take them all the way down,
you know, cut the entire leaf off,
[SPEAKER_06]: petiole and everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when I heard you say that,
I started leaving a little extra on there
[SPEAKER_06]: and actually helped out quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, it's those little things that
we pick up and we started adding all those
[SPEAKER_07]: little things together and make it real
successful regimen there, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you shouted out the Dominion G,
the screaming eagle.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what was the other one?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man, I can the six mil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like the six mil.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the six mil?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not familiar with that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the the local with the screaming
eagle I made for my for my buddy Kevin
[SPEAKER_07]: that passed away is like to his to his
favorites.
[SPEAKER_07]: His nickname is going to six million
dollar man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, rest in peace to him.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's awesome of you for making
something in his in his likeness like
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man, I was going to do it,
you know, doing it, doing it for him
[SPEAKER_07]: anyway, you know, but is this this weird
thing like, you know, like a spot on his
[SPEAKER_07]: back and like I've seen it there since
fucking nineties.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was this like a big it wasn't even like
a mole even, you know, it was just like a
[SPEAKER_07]: giant freckle birthmark.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, that's what I figured.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, forever goes by and.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, he has a lady, you know,
he met later and she's, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: she's like a nurse or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, you know, this wouldn't
hurt to get it checked out, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess he said, yeah, you would go do
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess they cut it to do a biopsy or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it had some crazy reaction and just
cancer spread throughout his body.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was dead in 72 hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's horrible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry to hear that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it threw me threw me off because by
the time he had had it done, I talked to
[SPEAKER_07]: him that day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't hear from him the next day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the following day, I'm like,
hey, I heard from him, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: and my buddy T.J.
[SPEAKER_07]: is like, you know, they're they're best
friends, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, yeah, he's in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_07]: He tells me it's happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, anyway, I can, you know,
like talk to him.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like he was in so much pain.
[SPEAKER_07]: They, you know, had to had to put him out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wasn't able to, you know,
say anything, you know, anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wrote up a text and it was just
like, you know, told him my.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, my final final thoughts or,
you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was hoping, you know, maybe if he
did wake up, you know, maybe he would see
[SPEAKER_07]: it or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: But he ended up he ended up dying that,
you know, that following day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it sounds like he would be a guy
that would really appreciate what you've
[SPEAKER_06]: done to honor him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, being in Hanover County,
Virginia, dude, he just thought it was the
[SPEAKER_07]: greatest fucking thing ever that,
you know, moved out west and was just
[SPEAKER_07]: doing things, doing things legit and like
really doing it up and doing it real
[SPEAKER_07]: proper.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, he just thought that was just
the best shit ever, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's your family, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the ones that want to want to see
you doing good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see you succeed.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're lucky.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're lucky you had him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was the best, you know, in nine homes
since like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nineteen ninety.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ninety three, something like that,
you know, and yeah, it's one of the best,
[SPEAKER_07]: best runs, you know, just awesome,
dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, just have to get to catch
up with him on the flip flop, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that'll happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always does matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe we're in energy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: And once you create it, it can't be
destroyed.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so on a brighter note,
we want to talk to you about some of those
[SPEAKER_06]: old skunks that you worked with since
that's kind of one of your mainstays.
[SPEAKER_06]: You had a lot that you did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you said, the Dominion skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember you had one that had a cross in
it and it was called basic skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I always thought that was funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, you especially in this day
and age, Duke, I know, I know you've been
[SPEAKER_06]: you've been away for a bit, but dear God,
if you're hearing some of the names that
[SPEAKER_06]: people are coming out with now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange cream sickle puppy dog.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like this is the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, dude, it was it was one on before I
left and we would make fun and be like,
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah, fucking Sherbert fucking butthole
cream pie.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then like all of a sudden you're like,
oh, wow, someone's actually calling
[SPEAKER_07]: something that now running out of dessert.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so these Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's on that shit?
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's on that shit?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I could name a couple.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't want buddy goofy ass names.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I've always been kind of I don't
know, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: My other way, my naming process is weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the fucking names that you come out
with, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Polcat was a big one to me because when I
had my cousins moved over to Montana,
[SPEAKER_06]: they lived on Polcat Road.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that name stuck out to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, fucking Polcat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we got to grow Polcat, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty dope.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you had that one, I remember
seeing the cross on it said basic skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, that's such a funny way to
name something when we were talking
[SPEAKER_06]: earlier about like the old tactics of,
oh, you can't have that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But who wants basic skunk like that sounds
like it's fucking it's basic.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the basic skunk and why did you
name it that?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just an old skunk, an old skunk
type hybrid.
[SPEAKER_07]: And back in the day, they had the the
basic five of these Sativa C club skunk
[SPEAKER_07]: hybrid, which is an old five.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's what they decided to call
it then.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so this was a SSSC original.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was their old name for an old
skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that makes more sense now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, using the like an old Sensei
Shiba skunk and basic skunk and making
[SPEAKER_07]: this hybrid.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't, you know, the basic five skunk
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was just like, I would just call it
basic skunk.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's cool because the name like that,
it was something, you know, we're keeping,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, keeping in house and everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, that's the name aligners like,
oh, okay, it's just a basic skunk.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to look over here, guy.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was that was a little bit
beyond my time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's nice hearing those stories and
getting familiarized with where those
[SPEAKER_06]: genetics came from.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the same thing with the CIS skunk?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or was that your creation?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that was that was one of mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you did do the CIS, the granny and the
local one was just one that was running
[SPEAKER_06]: around Virginia.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was another one that we that we
were just goofing around back in the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's a sour diesel IDL.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're goofing around with that,
which that went to pass out some testers
[SPEAKER_07]: to a few people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's some people that are already
were already growing sour.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he wanted our feedback on it,
you know, because we could give a real
[SPEAKER_07]: feedback and comparison to the client
because back then, you didn't have a whole
[SPEAKER_07]: shit ton of people growing sour diesel,
you know, you didn't have them that many
[SPEAKER_07]: people ever even smoked it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he needed the good feedback.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're just goofing around,
had the had the had the mail or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had this other ash plant plant back
then called the cuttlefish ash plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, so we were goofing around.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where the local came from.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we call it it was called the local H.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were jamming out on the radio.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a little radio.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was underneath a friend's house.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had dug out a pit, made a false door
and shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you serious?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Shawshank fucking redemption,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you my long lost brother?
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you're not going to tell me you
started growing with a heat lamp,
[SPEAKER_06]: did you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Even had a cop or a neighbor.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, fuck you, Mr. Fancy.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, my.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, my.
[SPEAKER_06]: My first was no, we had we had the same
thing falls door if I can.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it was like a little seller and
shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, we had chickens heat lamp.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was we thought that was a good idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: Outdoors, outdoors first.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was straight up in the dirt,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: We literally dug it dug it out little by
little and would take ass bags up and walk
[SPEAKER_07]: around the backyard, shifting the sift in
the dirt out like Shawshank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's dope, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's dope.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, I ran the electric to it and I
got a nice, nice little fucking grow down
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a little radio hooked up and that
band Local H, you know, that was on to and
[SPEAKER_07]: that shit was like straight like some
dope, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was really, really sour,
really, really potent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The name kind of stuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, yeah, you know, we'll keep
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that came from there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then making making hybrids with that
was definitely a really, really good one,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: You also like you seem to like the citrus
stuff, too, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I got I got some citrusy ones like
because you did the G 13, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The airborne G 13 and that like pink
lemonade citrus thing going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was the mom and the screaming,
the screaming eagle project.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so that was it.
[SPEAKER_06]: In that screaming eagle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why I've heard that name so many
times.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, fuck, I missed out on that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 88 G 13 Hashlant as a mom,
Afghani as the donor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big selection from there on the mail from
there and then hit the airborne G 13.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that that Virginia Beach Afghan?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a Kandahar Afghan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that was used for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the Virginia Beach Ghani.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just the as is the girl list when
we went on the mail route on the mail.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 88 with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're at a bunch of the girls saw what I
wanted to see on the mail.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was best for responding to that and
hit the airborne with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that way we got a good, good amount of
G 13 genetics in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus there's some NL two is half of that
airborne is it's a G 13 NL two.
[SPEAKER_07]: From old Neville seed bank stock that they
grew them out, you know, his little hand
[SPEAKER_07]: was airborne.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, you know, that was his keeper.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, between the Afghani and the
88 Ashland energy, 13 Hashlant,
[SPEAKER_07]: we were kind of getting good symmetry,
you know, good.
[SPEAKER_07]: The things are sinking up just,
just right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it ended up fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really, really love that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to continue to work with that
one too, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Philly, you know, while you answered
one of the next question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to, uh, you know, Philly will
read that one and, uh, come back at
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That way I can hone in on that one
phenotype that feels just, just so
[SPEAKER_07]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like all of them are great, but there's
the one phenome that, I mean, it pops up
[SPEAKER_07]: frequently, but like I want, I want the
majority of the pack popping.
[SPEAKER_07]: Popping like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And since there was only a limited amount
of them that went out to begin with
[SPEAKER_07]: anyway, so like general public,
cause most of them I gave out to the
[SPEAKER_07]: veterans for them to grow or people that
were grown for vets or PTSD and stuff and
[SPEAKER_07]: bad anxiety problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I remember.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I gave most of them away and then I had
a handful left that sold, uh, sold off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause you know, a lot of people like,
well, I need this, need that this people
[SPEAKER_07]: beating your door down.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so everybody had basically hit
me up.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was going to hit me up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like a whole fucking year,
maybe even more than a year later.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, all right, but the last
handful of them out, people went pretty
[SPEAKER_07]: much ape shit over it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, I was like, yeah, you know,
it's something I need to continue on
[SPEAKER_07]: because it was so impressed with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's such a good, good thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so would it be fair to say that you
have plans to get back into those,
[SPEAKER_06]: find that phenotype and backcross it?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I had already done, um, some.
[SPEAKER_07]: A filial step with it anyway, and,
or two steps with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it really honed in, it really,
really honed in just, just doing it like
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think, um, back crossing will
be, uh, will be necessary with that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to go forward with the
line.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just doing, doing the failure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, uh, you know, just, uh,
you know, we'll do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do that for, and then, you know,
check it out from there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, that's probably where I'll,
I'll leave it as just at a, just at an F
[SPEAKER_07]: four.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll keep, keep driving it in and in,
and then I'm getting that result of that
[SPEAKER_07]: for them.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm cool with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So everybody's got something to look
forward to eventually in the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you can, when there's a will,
there's a way, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're a free man again.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one more that I wanted to touch on was,
uh, I was going back through, obviously I
[SPEAKER_06]: remembered the Munson and the polecat,
but I, you know, a couple of those,
[SPEAKER_06]: the capital G that pop back up in my head.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you said cuttlefish, I remembered
that being talked about, but I just wasn't
[SPEAKER_06]: familiar enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: And going back through your, your types,
I saw one that was named Swayze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is it named Swayze?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it sexy as fuck?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of fucked up for real,
but so that one was the, uh, it was the
[SPEAKER_07]: ghost OG that I use with the hood.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love ghost.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you remember the movie ghost Swayze?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even make the fucking connection.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_06]: I even went, I read the, I read the
description.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, ghost OG.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love ghosts.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even, Jesus Christ.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm such a stoner.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I, I got a fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, it'll make it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it would go shout to man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you would, uh, and you know,
it's way used to be sliding the nose.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, oh, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Swayze, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would definitely put you out fucking,
uh, I'd say, yeah, like you used to like
[SPEAKER_07]: rock it out like pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you used to have like real great runs
of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a J, uh, J, uh, J plant speaker.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was, he was doing some gnarly runs of
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had a really, really funky skunky one
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had some questions from my patrons
that they wanted to ask you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Q ball.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh says, did you ever think you'd be
who you are today in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew like I wanted to do some good
things for people, but I had.
[SPEAKER_07]: No idea that there would be, by the time I
got out in the legit world, I just saw so
[SPEAKER_07]: much fuckery and bullshit and,
you know, people that were not,
[SPEAKER_07]: not the best people in the past.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, wow, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Y'all are, y'all are the people running
this now?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, then honestly, like it pissed me off
before I even moved out here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, all right, well,
you know, I'm still going to go do my
[SPEAKER_07]: thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, you know, I never expected
it, but one thing I can say to anybody,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's like, you're just doing what you do,
doing the right thing every day.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's the right thing and the good
energy and good intention, people that
[SPEAKER_07]: have that, that same basis, you know,
in their life, you know, ethics and,
[SPEAKER_07]: and quality and, and, and just,
you know, the whole, the whole can of
[SPEAKER_07]: worms, man, like those people are going to
find themselves drawn to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's refreshing about the whole
thing is like, there's so many really,
[SPEAKER_07]: really, really good people still left out
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that gave me a, definitely gave me
hope on the future.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but I never, no, I never, never
thought like when people are like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, you're legendary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God, you're famous.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, no, dude, I am not fucking eat
shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am just a normal fucking Virginia D
fucking that likes doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't forget where you came from.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It weirds me out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, first and ask for an
autograph.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, what are you fucking with me?
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, no, I want it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want a picture with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, all right, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pass always passing the good vibes,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want a picture to get a picture with
me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is, I get where you're coming from,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I fucking vibe with that for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a fucking, I had a guy pop into my
discord the other day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know who it was, but he said,
oh yeah, I'm long time fan of Doc Alex.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, I got, I got fans.
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then somebody, oh, and then another,
one of my buddies called me boss the other
[SPEAKER_06]: day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, I'm not your boss.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, well, how do you perceive
yourself?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, honestly, podcasting,
I was like, everybody wants to talk to
[SPEAKER_06]: breeders and shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just know some, I got some connections
and fucking talk to people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just a dude, just like a dude playing
another dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, I feel like I'm the Lorax of the
stoners.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll speak for y'all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got the hair and all.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another one of our patron members,
vanilla rice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that name.
[SPEAKER_06]: Vanilla rice.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, I heard you use fruit juices in
your feeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: Regime.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it FFJ FPJ, or are you talking about
actual fruit juice?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know what FFFP.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's K and F inputs, fermented plant juice
and fermented fruit juice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm using actual real 100% organic
fruit juice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually going out to like the real
hippie out stores and getting the really,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, get organic fruit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going like full on Jacqueline.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got, uh, I can turn into a puree and I'm
mixing it all together.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then from there, yeah, I'll ferment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was a day that asked me earlier,
like I saw the DOA and have a chance to
[SPEAKER_07]: get to it, but he was like, so do I add,
uh, and he said, break it down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I need to add like yeast to it?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I need to get back and I'm like,
no, unless you want to make brandy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if you want to make brandy and make
some liquor, then yes, we do not want
[SPEAKER_07]: alcohol, uh, water and then any alcohol.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we're not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, break it down.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you are, you're making about the best
type of FFJ FPJ you could, you're doing
[SPEAKER_06]: whole fruits, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Skins, everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Letting it naturally ferment.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's KNF brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right here in America.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you strain it out or do you use all the
pulp?
[SPEAKER_06]: I strain it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You strain it out just for like,
you know, running it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause like I would water using a pump.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I didn't want too many solids left
behind, but all the leftover I threw in
[SPEAKER_07]: my, uh, in my compost bin.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I use it as top dressing on the,
uh, on the pots.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you're throwing a mulch layer
over that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say my only concern would
be like ants and bugs and shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, well, you're doing this indoor too,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're controlling.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll, we'll reform castings on top of
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll insect grass, mix some leaves up
over top of that, you know, with some
[SPEAKER_07]: Akashi under it, you know, you're in the
skins and that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So another patron member, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Calix, uh, good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to shout them out right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Calix of okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Calix genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go hit him up.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you haven't seen him great fucking
dude, Duke, you love him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: He wanted to know how long until you were
growing again.
[SPEAKER_06]: We kind of talked about that already,
uh, future breeding plans.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you have anything else that you wanted
to do other than the, the screaming eagle?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing is with me is like, like I can
say like, yeah, definitely there's a lot,
[SPEAKER_07]: but the way that I, that I work is,
uh, it's really, they'll know when it's
done.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't count your eggs before they hatch,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also there's just too many knockoffs
out there and scammers.
[SPEAKER_07]: True.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like they'll find that they're
doing it, you know, they'll hear it and,
[SPEAKER_07]: oh, that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then claim that they got it and they
did it and there it is available for sale.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or they might even hear about.
[SPEAKER_07]: A client that's not even known of I've
seen this app so many times and it becomes
[SPEAKER_07]: this hot word.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm using this one, this one, this one,
and then before, you know, it all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's the lead is, yeah, it's,
it's.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, that, yeah, that's kind of the
shitty thing about being, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: held in regard, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're looking, uh, you got a lot of
people looking out for you and then,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, a lot of people looking out for
you and they're looking, they're looking
[SPEAKER_07]: at, you know, take advantage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if there's some inside
information I don't have or what's going
[SPEAKER_06]: on here, but he says, what was the new
exciting strain at the M.O.
cup?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't talk about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there was one that heroes of the
farm pat was the one that we did some
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff back in the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Freedom fighter.
[SPEAKER_07]: They might be talking about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is one that I did back in the day
and I gave them all to a KB brains and I
[SPEAKER_07]: was like, yeah, it is have them for what I
was like, well, you, you gave me a clone
[SPEAKER_07]: and you know, this is what happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like things are going to come back to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not, I'm not giving them out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like releasing them or anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want you to have them.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to do what you can sell them
and grow them, whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, we called it, uh, we called it
thunder hole and it was, uh, the mail was
[SPEAKER_07]: called ass man and it hit the thunder
block.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, his bad news.
Good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, we call it thunder hole and he had
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I guess, uh, they're,
they'll be available here, here in the
[SPEAKER_07]: very, very near future because I gave them
a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he just had them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm definitely seeing that same fucking
vibe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I understand why AK said I would like
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, yeah, I can see that
motherfucker saying thunder hole too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: This shit, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the thunder hole, what has he got to
talk to you about it much?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, what is it that he loves about it so
much?
[SPEAKER_07]: It just insane amounts of resin and
really, really strong, not down potency,
[SPEAKER_07]: but he was getting these, uh, the real
strong orange, uh, citrusy.
[SPEAKER_07]: He knows that he was just pulling away
with like nice Christmas tree,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I was like, yeah, knock down potency
is definitely, I was like between that
[SPEAKER_07]: male and the thunder fog is like,
it doesn't really have much of a choice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big beefy plants, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, and just get out and fucking flop
down, take, take knock you down shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good deal, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: So are you more in, I mean, you work with.
[SPEAKER_06]: You work with skunks.
[SPEAKER_06]: You work with G 13.
[SPEAKER_06]: You also do so much Afghani work and shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have like a preference in the type
of high that you enjoy?
[SPEAKER_06]: I like them all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this depends on the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: They all have their own place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there one that you're like wanting more
than the other?
[SPEAKER_07]: Nah, like so.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is kind of a segue with the,
you know, we were talking about medical
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff too is like if you smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: That same thing every day, day in,
day out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can build up that tolerance and it's
just not as great as it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: so like chasing the dragon looking for it
again, but you just got, you got to put it
[SPEAKER_07]: down and get away from it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I always like, you know, the,
so for our time and place, so like my day
[SPEAKER_07]: times three to five different things I
like for the daytime intermediate in the
[SPEAKER_07]: evening.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to chill, but I still got to do
shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I had three to five I like for
that and three to five.
[SPEAKER_07]: For just knocking me the fuck out at
night.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that way I can rotate through these.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the same thing with like dealing with
medical patients is like finding multiple
[SPEAKER_07]: things that are getting to that same goal
for them or leaving them with whatever
[SPEAKER_07]: element it might be.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that way they can rotate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this one day, this one, the next day,
and then go through that cycle.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they don't really build that tolerance
up to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're getting good relief,
you know, day in and day out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I had a lot of different little
ones for the day and then in the evening
[SPEAKER_07]: and then, you know, definitely for the
night too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good deal, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very much the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel myself going for the more heady
shit most of the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm one of those guys that's like,
I'm going to keep going and I'm going all
[SPEAKER_06]: day until I pass the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no relaxing and going to bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just like fucking when my body gives
out, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's when I'm going to smoke my
bedtime shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty rare for me and finding a
cultivar that I appreciate for that time
[SPEAKER_06]: of the day when I'm just, I'm ready to go
to bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm done.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to be relaxed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to lay in my bed, float for a
second and fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What have you produced that you would be
like, man, this is, this is what you need
[SPEAKER_06]: to go up for Betty by.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say for the night at local school
was pretty fucking knocked down.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the, some of these females,
like it was this over, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: overboard.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would also have to say these purple
Dalia, you know, is a real good for me for
[SPEAKER_07]: going to sleep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was looking at that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really liked that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stash plant was another, another real,
this heavy put you out type type stone,
[SPEAKER_07]: granny skunk.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was another one that was definitely
more on the, on the narcotic narcotics
[SPEAKER_07]: side, screaming eagle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if you're really chief and chief and
hard, you know, it's definitely going to,
[SPEAKER_07]: definitely going to put you in that zone
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was the beefcake D, which was like a
figure four male to the Kim dog D that one
[SPEAKER_07]: was pretty, pretty heavy on the sedation
as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why, but Kim and OG bring me
up like a motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say that too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get that, but a lot of people that
knocks out, it brings me the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Kim in the morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had, I guess I've had friends in the
past, like ever have any friends,
[SPEAKER_07]: like they put them on Ridland or Adderall
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is like 80.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck that would make a lot of sense
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an ABD drug.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, you have a friend that
literally bounces off the walls all the
[SPEAKER_07]: fucking time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they give them the shit and then it
just metals them out, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: allows them to concentrate and,
you know, do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: They become calm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if you give that same drug to someone
else who doesn't need that, they're going
[SPEAKER_07]: to fucking bounce all over the walls and
it's the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's some people.
[SPEAKER_07]: That can take like narcotics, even
Percocets and Oxycontin and shell like
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And man, they're, they're fucking zinging
around the fucking place doing,
[SPEAKER_07]: doing work and talking a million miles an
hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, the next man,
you know, he's going to be passed out for
[SPEAKER_07]: about eight hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, depending on the person,
you know, it really had, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: you can say like the majority of people
experience this, but yeah, sometimes it's
[SPEAKER_07]: the exact opposite, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I found that interesting with those
two, because I'm typically one of those
[SPEAKER_06]: people that if it is more along that
Indica, I say that very openly because
[SPEAKER_06]: that's such a, you know, coagulated topic
of what's Indica, what's sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But more of those style of plants usually
do put me out and more of the hazes and
[SPEAKER_06]: the sativas, if you will, do bring me up.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for some reason, Kam and OG just they
don't fit that profile.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what you could start using.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, fuck.
