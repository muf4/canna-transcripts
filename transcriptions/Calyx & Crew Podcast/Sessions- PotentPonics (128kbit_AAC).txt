[SPEAKER_04]: What is up everybody and welcome to a
brand new episode of the Calyx and crew
[SPEAKER_04]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm your host as always Doc Calyx.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank you for taking time out of
your day to come and join us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a very special guest today.
[SPEAKER_04]: None other than the man himself,
Steve Reisner, who is very well known for
[SPEAKER_04]: large scale farming, aquaponics,
natural farming and growing in a ton of
[SPEAKER_04]: different areas all around the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing Steve?
[SPEAKER_06]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's seven o'clock in the morning here in
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit later for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's a little bit rough for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we'd mentioned before, I think you
and I had kind of the same night last
[SPEAKER_04]: night.
[SPEAKER_04]: What were you out doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just hanging out with a good friend
of mine who's a female Thai fighter and we
[SPEAKER_07]: had a fun evening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to ask you, you know,
you just got back from the you did the
[SPEAKER_04]: Canex Asia Cup in which you got a judge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you find anything special when you
guys were going through that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I was just funny enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just looking at the entry.
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually have a lot of the original
testers still here, but the one that won
[SPEAKER_06]: that I thought was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this one had like really different
notes to it was this apes in space.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was the one that won the cup and this
is apes in space.
[SPEAKER_07]: Space by Kamar Taz is the name of the
farmer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was nice to see a lot of really
nice, you know, premium quality stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: that's been Thai grown.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a lot of people in Thailand have
been complaining about the imports,
[SPEAKER_06]: but, you know, there's a lot of Thai
people that are producing stuff that,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, you wouldn't know the difference
between that and someone at Cal,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, they're producing really good
fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say five to seven percent of the
people here really know what they're doing
[SPEAKER_06]: and can really dial in their stuff the
same way you can in the West.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the rest of it is like,
you know, might as well be Oklahoma and,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, just everyone that could get a
license grew and, you know, grab the seeds
[SPEAKER_06]: from their sock drawer and threw them in
and whatever happened, happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's been funny to see a bunch of the
Thai farmers be like, I'm going to grow
[SPEAKER_06]: watermelons again next year.
[SPEAKER_06]: That didn't work out for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was like, well, that totally could
have if you just went and got some
[SPEAKER_06]: genetics that worked from your local
village.
[SPEAKER_06]: And no disrespect to the Thai stuff,
but we've popped about 60 different Thai
[SPEAKER_06]: strains so far and only two of them,
I think, have any kind of commercial
[SPEAKER_06]: value.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to say that some of the other ones
don't have some unique terpene profiles or
[SPEAKER_06]: this, that or the other, but nothing
that's going to be any kind of viable.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the simply the bud structure on
a lot of the Laos, the Cambodian and the
[SPEAKER_06]: Thai stuff is just to the point where,
you know, I could grow a six foot plant,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I'm only going to get maybe,
you know, a QP off of it or, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe half a pound because there's just no
bud structure on all the buds are are
[SPEAKER_06]: super super small.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's been one of the biggest things
we have found a couple of cool ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: One or two coffee ties, one or two
chocolate ties.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the one that it's my favorite by
far of all the Thai stuff we found was the
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff that a can of Thai seeds found.
[SPEAKER_06]: He found this we call it temple tie or
Thai Buddha massive.
[SPEAKER_06]: But these came off of these 20,
24 foot tall plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: They smell like peaches.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're just like these gigantic like
it almost looks like something out of like
[SPEAKER_06]: NorCal or Southern Oregon, these gigantic
enormous plants, but they grow that way
[SPEAKER_06]: under 1212.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they're not even like they just get
to be like 20 feet tall and then flip.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the craziest thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the vigor on those plants from seed on
week eight, they're already pushing 11
[SPEAKER_06]: feet from seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, and then don't talk a good node
spacing, you know, bushy, good density,
[SPEAKER_06]: like barely need any pruning.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're just bushing out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I've never seen a plant that grows
like that ever anywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been to Africa, Jamaica,
like South America, all over.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've never seen a plant that is bigger
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the seeds on that one looked
abnormally big.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're literally four times the
size of any other cannabis plant I've ever
[SPEAKER_06]: seen before.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that includes some of the larger ones
I've seen out West.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we were talking earlier that you
said you had gone through thousands of
[SPEAKER_04]: Thai seeds and found very few that were
worth cultivating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it norm?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it just the bud structure alone or was
it the yield or what?
[SPEAKER_04]: What was special about those few that you
did keep?
[SPEAKER_06]: So the, the, the Buddha tie, the vigor on
it, and there's the speed of growth and
[SPEAKER_06]: there's the potential.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could cross that with, you know,
anything and it's going to, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're going to get something cool out of
it, you know, that's going to have vigor.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's unparalleled.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I don't think it's very good for
indoor gross, but for outdoor man,
[SPEAKER_06]: that gene, that genetic pool is going to
add a lot of nice stuff to a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: people's work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it kind of revived some of that vigor.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of people that have,
if they're, if you're on like a F12 or an
[SPEAKER_06]: F14, you might've lost a little vigor or,
you know, even F6 or F7, you might've lost
[SPEAKER_06]: a little vigor on your, on your beans,
but you cross it back, cross it with that
[SPEAKER_06]: to get them giant again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you're certainly going to find some
gems in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm really excited to get that back out
to the, to the States and allow,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, kind of see what people can kind
of create with that, because it's,
[SPEAKER_06]: like I said, I've been around for a long
time and I haven't seen anything quite the
[SPEAKER_06]: way that that plant does.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, uh, but, uh, as far as the other ones,
some of the sandalwood turps have been
[SPEAKER_06]: pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: And finding some of those really funky,
like just more potpourri.
[SPEAKER_06]: It almost smells like some of the
potpourris my mom used to make when I was
[SPEAKER_06]: a kid and not, not anything like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's been pretty strange.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, other than that, I would say like 75%
of the country is just lemonade dominant,
[SPEAKER_06]: like stuff that you guys already have,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like how many lemon strains do you guys
have in the States?
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's another lemonade strain that
doesn't have anything else really unique
[SPEAKER_06]: to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't yield well.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have plenty of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about that a couple of podcasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go, I said, I've had so much lemon shit
at this point, like it's gotta be
[SPEAKER_04]: something original about her spectacular,
like a different, a lemon that doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: follow that typical, like sour land,
lemonine thing, you know, it's gotta be
[SPEAKER_04]: like a super sugary, sweet lemon or
something different to impress me because
[SPEAKER_04]: it just kind of gets convoluted and they
all kind of get really similar,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like a lemon skunk is a lemon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hayes is a lemon, but I know that you
said, you had gone through a ton of
[SPEAKER_04]: different, uh, genetics and you were
finding some really crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you posted that one up that was a
herm, but it had hermed different sexes on
[SPEAKER_04]: different branches of the same plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you also posted about that crazy ass
one that had no serrations and was just
[SPEAKER_04]: completely smooth leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: After going through all these different
genetics, uh, what else have you found
[SPEAKER_04]: that has blown your mind that you have not
seen before in other places?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and maybe even something that you
might want to breed forward with.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, definitely that non serrated plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only time I've ever seen that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've, I've popped a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I've been doing this for quite a long
time and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I message other people, I only know
one other person that managed to find it
[SPEAKER_06]: actually to take it back to other people
that I've ever seen it before.
[SPEAKER_06]: But someone told me it's from like the
highlands of Indonesia, like some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: Indonesian highland stuff is like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and that that's probably where it came
from.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I was told that the strain came from
originally Northern Thailand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that I know that from two other people
that's probably came from Cambodia or
[SPEAKER_06]: Indonesia, um, just because of that,
that trait.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but it could just be a mutation,
but that's the, I've only seen that one
[SPEAKER_06]: time and I've seen plenty of other,
you know, freak show mutations and other
[SPEAKER_06]: mutations just kind of pop up.
[SPEAKER_06]: We even have a blue bull Soto that almost
looks like a freak show and it has no
[SPEAKER_06]: freak show genetics in it whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's almost that same leaf expression.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, rare is, isn't unheard of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but that, like you were saying,
the, the male female branches on some of
[SPEAKER_06]: those terms that that's pretty common on,
on tropical stuff, but you don't see it on
[SPEAKER_06]: foot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a Northern photo is hardly ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but on a lot of the Thai stuff or
Columbus, some of the Colombian stuff or
[SPEAKER_06]: some of the African stuff, if it's really
dialed into the, the tropical light
[SPEAKER_06]: settings for whatever reason, it seems to,
to increase that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we've also been like group binding
the, uh, you know, only putting the
[SPEAKER_06]: testers into like two or three gallons.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pots to try and force root stress.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been flowering them out in 107
degree heat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we're trying to find, you know,
push the plants to be like, okay,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're going to harm her and show me that
you're going to do that so that we can get
[SPEAKER_06]: rid of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's part of the testing process when
you're female hunting is punishing the
[SPEAKER_06]: testers a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can, you know, kind of sift out the
stuff that's weak.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of our Patreon members dank magician
wants to know, is that exotic genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: apes in space?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, uh, is the honest question.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just one of the name of the stream.
[SPEAKER_05]: The top five were divine storm,
apes in space.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,
[SPEAKER_07]: the apples and banana and the purple
magenta.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I smoked a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was the other one.
[SPEAKER_06]: The purple majestic actually was one of
the most unique ones because the purple
[SPEAKER_06]: majestic actually had some on clove turps
and I've only had a clove turps,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, in cannabis, maybe three or four times
where it smells, it almost smelled like
[SPEAKER_06]: you mixed a jar of the jar of black.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember the black cigarettes?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It smells like you took one of those and
crumbled a little bit through the bud,
[SPEAKER_06]: even though it's just a bunch of flavors.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was really interesting just from a
terms of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uniqueness.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't had that before, or at least
when a purple strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I've ever had like clove
more of the potpourri like you were saying
[SPEAKER_04]: earlier, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a spicy floral thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't say I've come across clove.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty damn cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, since we were on the topic of land
races, you and I had talked earlier,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, me coming from a place where I really
respect and love cultivating land,
[SPEAKER_04]: raise seeds, knowing myself that most of
them are going to be shit and it's going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be a heavy coal process.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just find something special in finding
that one in a million, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, it's something unique that nobody has.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's entirely your own and you can
proliferate on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said a lot of these genetics are
contaminated nowadays.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and some of the best stuff is coming
from Africa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you feel that way?
[SPEAKER_06]: Africa, especially Zimbabwe, Mozambique,
and some of the other areas have been so
[SPEAKER_06]: war torn.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or had other political issues that there
was no commercial production for export,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, uh, Sudan, like any of the areas that
have been really rough in Africa,
[SPEAKER_06]: who's going to go in there and bring in a
bunch of Western genetics to grow and
[SPEAKER_06]: export nobody, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That there's no economic benefit to it
because logistics are too impossible.
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are the places that I've found
that actually have true real land race
[SPEAKER_06]: left was in Zimbabwe and Mozambique.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the only place I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even in East Swatini, um, would you,
uh, Swazi land is what most of your
[SPEAKER_06]: listeners probably know it as.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, they just changed the name not long
ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: For those of you that don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, they, even they like were,
I don't think I saw any land race there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was all contaminated because they've
been exporting for so long as the primary
[SPEAKER_06]: economic source of, or primary income
source there for those people that of
[SPEAKER_06]: course they're going to bring in some
better yielding genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: You would, if you're a poor farmer in the
middle of a bumble fuck trying to feed his
[SPEAKER_06]: family, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that makes total sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I can't even knock the guy,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that totally like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Please man feed your children.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, like we're trying to
find these, these rare genetics that have
[SPEAKER_06]: been messed with yet, but Jamaica has been
basically completely contaminated and has
[SPEAKER_06]: been as far as I'm aware, since 2016,
you might have a couple of Rastas that
[SPEAKER_06]: have been preserving stuff here and there,
but most of the Island, I've been an
[SPEAKER_06]: Eastern side, Western side all around.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's all basically just been flooded
with Western genetics at this point,
[SPEAKER_06]: but in Africa and Zimbabwe, you don't hear
too many Rastas or stoners going to
[SPEAKER_06]: Zimbabwe for seed hunting, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's just, uh, that's not known for
that, but there's some incredible pining
[SPEAKER_06]: dominance Tiva's there and some stuff that
is just real great smoke and really
[SPEAKER_06]: unique.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, it's not being persecuted the
same way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Weeds illegal there, but like,
you know, they're not, unless you like are
[SPEAKER_06]: being real blatant and stupid about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're selling to school children.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really that big a deal, you know,
and it's more tolerated than it is,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, anything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about, okay, before we move on to
that, actually, um, you're saying most of
[SPEAKER_04]: these land races are contaminated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, how do you feel about the land races
around Thailand?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's such a diverse group throughout
the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, like, what are we looking at?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like 50% maybe of the country might still
hold land race or is it pretty hard?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thailand has a lot of land race,
but I think in the next year that's about
[SPEAKER_06]: to disappear because of all the pollen
floating around in the country.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, so what's interesting about the
Thai stuff is so you have the lowland
[SPEAKER_06]: stuffs anywhere where there's rice fields
or the lowland wetter areas seem to almost
[SPEAKER_06]: be all lemony dominant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when we get into the mountains
and the Hills, like when I go up to Calco
[SPEAKER_06]: and stuff like that, then I start to run
into a lot more of the mango dominant in
[SPEAKER_06]: the, in the forest and like where the
trees are and all that in the Hills seems
[SPEAKER_06]: to be almost exclusively mango dominant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when you get up to Chang,
Mai or close to Chang, Mai, you start to
[SPEAKER_06]: get some of the weirder Himalayan genetics
and some of the sandalwood turps and some
[SPEAKER_06]: of the chocolate turps and some of the
weirder coffee turps and some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: funkier stuff, which was deep and north of
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so it kind of seems like it's very
region and climate specific.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and you can definitely tell that
they're honing in on, okay, it's trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: stop this, this or this, uh, and whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, that, uh, it definitely,
it seems to be very region specific and I
[SPEAKER_06]: can almost smell it and tell you roughly,
you know, I can't tell you what city it's
[SPEAKER_06]: from, but I can tell you what climate it's
from in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, that's having gone around about
60 different farms and smelled quite a bit
[SPEAKER_06]: of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what about the esteemed blue tie and
those blueberry turps?
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you come across that yet?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I have not found anything berry
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I found some tropical fruity stuff,
but nothing that was more like strawberry
[SPEAKER_06]: or like, like candy, bananas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it was, uh, nothing on the,
on the blueberry or berry end at all,
[SPEAKER_06]: not in terms of Thai stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking about acceptance in the
country around there.
[SPEAKER_04]: How has Thailand changed post or
pre-legalization versus post-legalization?
[SPEAKER_04]: I always assumed that Thailand for an
Asiatic country was one of the more
[SPEAKER_04]: accepting areas, um, for cannabis use and
cannabis history.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I used to get a caning and then
depending on how much you had,
[SPEAKER_06]: you could, uh, you could get even a more
severe punishment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but, um, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and in fact, like, just to want to say
some of our neighbors are still pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: draconian.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, fuck Indonesia just hanged a guy
yesterday or Indonesia.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't see that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't Vietnam pretty bad too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Vietnam and Cambodia are very chill.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I know plenty of people growing over
there that are not having issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's very tolerated.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me put it that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of the Thai stuff is ending up
over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me put it that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, um, but, uh, it's interesting that you
bring this topic up because in seven days
[SPEAKER_06]: from now, this whole industry could end
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, the, uh, elections are coming,
uh, next Sunday, seven days from now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And depending on which party wins,
the party that's most likely to win is
[SPEAKER_06]: extremely anti-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to roll it back to drug status
and make it a medical program only,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, and basically sell it through
universities and hospitals, which would
[SPEAKER_06]: pull the rug out from the entire industry
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, they could possibly have a medical,
uh, card for talk for ties.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would imagine that would be yearly or a
one time thing for Thai people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then tourists, I would imagine they're
going to have a 30 day card or a 45 day
[SPEAKER_06]: card or some bullshit like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but that that's what it's looking like
it could be, but they could just repeal it
[SPEAKER_06]: and arrest everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we don't know what you have 24 hours
from the time it's published in the Royal
[SPEAKER_06]: Gazette.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if they pass it, you got 24 hours to
get the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, that could absolutely happen next
week.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, in fact, I've been, uh,
working on some, some backup plans in case
[SPEAKER_06]: of the, the event on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, you, you know, everybody in this
country is very nervous about what's going
[SPEAKER_06]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of money pumped into the
economy here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also to like, yeah, it would
screw a lot of Thai people over if they
[SPEAKER_06]: did that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, fuck the, the, the farm here and
where I am, they hire, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: 20 to 30 local ties every single week.
[SPEAKER_06]: And most of them on a, on a five to six
day a week basis, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: All those people would lose their jobs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those people did not have hype,
you know, decent paying jobs before
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis got started.
[SPEAKER_06]: They weren't getting paid what we're
paying them out here in the middle of
[SPEAKER_06]: bumblefuck and the rice fields.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were getting paid whatever they got
made off the rice, like that completely
[SPEAKER_06]: different income level.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's allowed a ton of money to come
into a lot of these more remote parts of
[SPEAKER_06]: Thailand.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would have never seen income investment
that was even a 10th of the scale of
[SPEAKER_06]: what's, what's been pumped into these
villages.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think a lot of the villagers now are
like, yo, we don't really like weed,
[SPEAKER_06]: but this guy has brought a ton of money
into the restaurant and the lady that the
[SPEAKER_06]: housekeepers and all of these other things
that, that, you know, end up benefiting
[SPEAKER_06]: the village financially and buying the
local fish from the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like all those, and the mechanic that
fixes the trucks and the guy that fixes
[SPEAKER_06]: the scooters and the gas station and all
these people end up financially benefiting
[SPEAKER_06]: from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that they didn't really
realize that until they had a chance to,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, you know, actually have a full blown
market and kind of see how it all played
[SPEAKER_06]: out and how people got, got hired and how
that money kind of trickled down through
[SPEAKER_06]: the economy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, again, in general, once you have,
you know, a large percentage of money or a
[SPEAKER_06]: large amount of money invested in the
economy, it's pretty hard for them to
[SPEAKER_06]: repeal the laws.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in Thailand, I mean, they have this
TIT, this is Thailand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, uh, you know, it's kind of a common
saying here, but like, you can't expect
[SPEAKER_06]: anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like everything can be turned upside down
at any point here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, you never really know what's
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the acceptance being what it is right
now, um, if it were to flip flop into the
[SPEAKER_04]: other party, uh, do you think there would
be a lot of combativeness against the
[SPEAKER_04]: future of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you're going to see a pretty big
ass protest in Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they do make it illegal, you're going
to see in Chiang Mai and Bangkok and
[SPEAKER_06]: probably Pattaya as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to see some pretty massive
protests of people going, don't fuck with
[SPEAKER_06]: my money.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, and also too, I would even imagine
maybe some of the village areas because
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, there definitely are people that
want to blame cannabis for the different
[SPEAKER_06]: problems in society, but almost all of
those problems go back.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, there was even a case this week
in Pattaya of a guy losing his shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it turns out the guy was actually on
meth, not cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, yeah, I know everybody knows that
meth heads act stupid, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like why don't, why aren't we cracking
down on that?
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's a big meth issue here in
Thailand because of the war next door.
[SPEAKER_06]: So those who don't know Burma or,
uh, what is the new current name?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think my current name is Myanmar.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Myanmar, uh, is currently having a
civil war right now, like a full blown,
[SPEAKER_06]: pretty gnarly civil war and both sides,
both the army and the rebels are making
[SPEAKER_06]: meth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, buying precursors from China because
they're next door.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I'm making method industrial
quantities and then, uh, using that to
[SPEAKER_06]: fund buying bullets and army supplies
basically.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, you have a strange influx increase
of meth in Southeast Asia right now
[SPEAKER_06]: because of the civil war over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, and that, that's a way bigger
problem than the cannabis is the hands
[SPEAKER_04]: down.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think the education level on
cannabis is us versus Thailand?
[SPEAKER_06]: Extremely low.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a, again, it's been the biggest
barrier and it's been one of the things
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been trying to address by doing a lot
of translated media.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I just presented actually at,
uh, at the Canex Expo.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did two whole presentations and all of
the presentations were both in English and
[SPEAKER_06]: Thai.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I can't speak Thai, but all of the
slides were in Thai, any of the reference
[SPEAKER_06]: material, any of the stuff that was like
step one, step two, step three,
[SPEAKER_06]: all of it was in English and Thai so that
they could screenshot it and to try and
[SPEAKER_06]: break that barrier.
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, that's, that's the number one
enemy of cannabis be at the United States.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Thailand or Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the lack of consumer education and
regulator education is the number one
[SPEAKER_06]: thing that's fucking us more than anything
else.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see you guys over in the chat,
just dying at the, dying at the aquaponics
[SPEAKER_04]: questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like Steve does a ton of
aquaponics, so I wanted to get more into
[SPEAKER_04]: what he was doing over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yes, you also did the growing with
fishes podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Has that been on the back burner for a
while or are you still pursuing that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, I still do the growing with
fishes podcast.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a week or two off during,
um, during four 20 because I was,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, at the Canex expo and I just couldn't
get a good stable enough signal to
[SPEAKER_06]: broadcast with there with all the people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so I gave up on trying to stream from
there, but the original plan was to do an
[SPEAKER_06]: episode from the stage there, but we just
could not get the, uh, logistics to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, uh, we did have an episode this week.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we are, we have fuck 336 episodes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, each episode is one to three hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of them are two to three hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it's over 800 hours of educational
content.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have tons of amazing interviews.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have almost five hours with Frenchy and
a whole bunch of other people that have
[SPEAKER_06]: since left, left this plane.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to learn from some of the
old OGs that aren't with us anymore,
[SPEAKER_06]: we get a lot of amazing interviews with
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Michael McShane is another warrior that
since moved on and some other things like
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, we really have a lot of cool
content on there and a lot of like unique
[SPEAKER_06]: interviews about unique topics that I
haven't really seen covered in some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: other, other shows.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: We kind of try to anchor.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't done any grafting since I've
been here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did some grafting back in Pennsylvania
when I was younger and then out in
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado because of the plant counts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to get a couple of strains onto one
mom, but I have not done any grafting
[SPEAKER_06]: here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, there just hasn't been a need.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I've mostly been more grafting with
fruit trees than I have cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, when you were saying that and the type
of, uh, people that you like to have on
[SPEAKER_04]: your podcast, the first place my mind went
was one of our, uh, our SIPP specialist
[SPEAKER_04]: over in our discord.
[SPEAKER_04]: He teaches about sub irrigated planners.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is known for grafting.
[SPEAKER_04]: He graphs a ton of plants for the exact
same reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: Low plant counts trying to get more
diversity, you know, in different types in
[SPEAKER_04]: your grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and that made it to the point where he
was collecting a root stock and grafting
[SPEAKER_04]: as many different types as he could on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty, I think it's an extremely
interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, how often do you do your podcast?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like get on a schedule.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do my, I do my podcast every
Thursday, uh, at 7 30 PM Pacific.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes it's a little earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes it's a little later.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just depends on what time zone the
guest is in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and where would you throw up a
notification about that?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're always live on YouTube and then
we repost them on all audio platforms.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if anyone ever is doing their own
podcast, highly suggest cross-platforming
[SPEAKER_06]: it because, uh, we get probably 20 to 40
times listeners in our audio format than
[SPEAKER_06]: we do on our video format.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, Patreon member dang Panda wants to
know what's the best species of fish for
[SPEAKER_04]: aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really depends on your temperature and
your climate in general, uh, tilapia are
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of the best because you can eat them.
[SPEAKER_06]: They breed pretty readily and unless your
water gets very cold, they're not really a
[SPEAKER_06]: problem until you get to about below 55
degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, they should be kept above 62,
but you know, ideally, uh, but if you have
[SPEAKER_06]: a power outage, you can let them go a
little bit lower before they start
[SPEAKER_06]: croaking on you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, uh, coy would be the next best,
uh, best one because they have good resale
[SPEAKER_06]: values.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do butterfly coy and you can just
flip them to, you know, any pond store or
[SPEAKER_06]: pet store, as long as they're decent,
you know, decent health.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and they have the best return on value
for dollar gained, uh, in terms of
[SPEAKER_06]: something that anyone could easily raise.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, the best return on dollar would be to
start raising arowanas or some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: other real fancy Asian fish, but,
um, you need to know a little bit about
[SPEAKER_06]: how to select the right ones, but those
can be, you know, $20,000 plus per fish.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you release no, start knowing what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in some cases, $80,000 of fish enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that one that you have,
dank?
[SPEAKER_04]: He has one that's very similar to like an
arowana look, but I think it's a different
[SPEAKER_04]: one though.
[SPEAKER_07]: The knife fish.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we have knife fish here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The clown was very happy to see that
you're a fisherman as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: How does the fishing differentiate?
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked like you were using a modern
style pole.
[SPEAKER_04]: How different is it Western versus
Thailand?
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can get a fishing rod here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have two fishing rods.
[SPEAKER_06]: We go fishing almost every other Sunday.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a next door.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have an 86 year old neighbor and he
doesn't have really anybody to hang out
[SPEAKER_06]: with.
[SPEAKER_06]: And his wife has passed away.
[SPEAKER_06]: So him and I hang out on Sundays and have
a couple beers by the river.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but, uh, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and then a lot of people net fish,
they'll gill net or they'll, um,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, you know, set up barriers and fish
traps.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are really common here, but,
uh, a lot of people also just,
[SPEAKER_06]: they'll, they'll dig a couple of ponds on
their property and then they'll just like
[SPEAKER_06]: breed and raise fish.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what they'll do is they'll get like a
little tiny lamp with an extension cord
[SPEAKER_06]: and hang it like a foot or two above the
water with strings that come from the
[SPEAKER_06]: grass that just just staked out around the
pond and the crickets and stuff,
[SPEAKER_06]: crawl up the string and go to the lamp and
then fall in.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll see all the fish hanging out
underneath it at night is waiting for the
[SPEAKER_06]: bugs to fall in or the moths to hit the
water.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they don't even pay to feed the fish.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just put a lamp on the pond.
[SPEAKER_06]: At night and they don't have to do
anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the most low effort,
low labor fish keeping you've ever seen in
[SPEAKER_06]: your life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I have to ask you something
controversial.
[SPEAKER_04]: You posted about the dog liquor not too
long ago and the purple stems.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't throw any names out there,
but I had heard some very notorious
[SPEAKER_04]: growers, um, talk about the health of
plants and if the biology of the soil and
[SPEAKER_04]: everything is on, uh, there's no such
thing as purple stems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's not genetic and anything healthy
will grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Green.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think those people have not grown enough
different types of genetics to know what
[SPEAKER_06]: they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I've had, I mean, there's so many
different ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen everything from red stems or
purple stems to blue stems.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cultivar specific, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And anywhere where you have higher UV
exposure, the tropics or high altitude,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're going to have significant increase
in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: For instance, um, a rosning, uh,
you guys probably know rosning is one of
[SPEAKER_06]: the most popular Instagrammers with Afghan
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the red Mareef having nutrient issues?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the stems are crimson, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, again, with that dog liquor,
the buds looked great.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, there's no sulfur issues, which is
normally what it's attributed to or
[SPEAKER_06]: phosphorus issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's dialed in, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's the plants get a liquid IMO for
like in terms of plant stuff, every third
[SPEAKER_06]: watering, right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: The biology is cranked in it's living
soil, 40% of its compost.
[SPEAKER_06]: From previous runs, like there's no,
you know, we're going low nutrient levels
[SPEAKER_06]: on any of the feedings.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of it's plant ferments.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there's no, uh, there's no excess of
any nutrient or imbalance of any nutrient,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, nothing that we can test for it
on the runoff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I don't know why,
why, you know, again, I understand you
[SPEAKER_06]: definitely can have extreme sulfur issues
that will do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, when I was in Jamaica, sulfur issues
is a problem with the, um, the leech rock
[SPEAKER_06]: and stuff there.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of them are very high in sulfur.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can absolutely have like red or
pink stems and the stuff I saw in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I absolutely think that was partially
to do with the mineral composition of the
[SPEAKER_06]: water of the soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the stuff we have here where it's all
controlled, where we have 30 or 40
[SPEAKER_06]: different, uh, phenos and only one or two
of them is showing that purple and
[SPEAKER_06]: everything looks identically healthy.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just that particular pheno is you
increasing the anthocyanin production in
[SPEAKER_06]: the stem because it's trying to protect
itself from the UV.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like what let's talk about this maybe a
different way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are the plants purple or red?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's anthocyanin production.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why does the plant produce anthocyanin
either as a UV protectant or an
[SPEAKER_06]: antifreeze?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if it's cold and you get, you know,
big 20, 30 degree temperature swings,
[SPEAKER_06]: daytime to nighttime, the plant thinks it
might get cold enough to freeze,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's going to produce the antifreeze to
keep that tissue damp and reduce tissue
[SPEAKER_06]: damage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if it's high altitude or in the tropics
like I am, you're going to have that
[SPEAKER_06]: increased anthocyanin production because
it's trying to protect itself from the UV
[SPEAKER_06]: damage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anthocyanin is very good at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing that plants, other reason
why plants will produce anthocyanin is to
[SPEAKER_06]: lock up the molybdenum.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if you have too much molybdenum or
velenium, it can actually bind to the
[SPEAKER_06]: nitrogen or not bind to the nitrogen,
but can, can affect nitrogen uptake.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the plant will actually produce extra
anthocyanin to bind up some of that
[SPEAKER_06]: molybdenum or velenium, depending on which
one's in mild excess to, to lock out that
[SPEAKER_06]: molybdenum.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it doesn't have that negative impact on
nitrogen uptake.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot of different reasons why
plants produce anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just because the sulfur was too
high, which I think a lot of people have
[SPEAKER_06]: been horribly mis-educated on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think it's their fault.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think that no one ever taught them,
you know, they just didn't go through a
[SPEAKER_06]: botany class.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were never properly educated on the
topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I completely agree with you for most
of that, that I didn't know before,
[SPEAKER_04]: but holy crap, man, I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd never even gone into it that much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely soil biology affecting it,
but going into the malignant attaching
[SPEAKER_04]: itself with the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never even heard of that before.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of the most common things I've
fixed in lettuce farms.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the most common questions I get
on lettuce aquaponic producers is,
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, my red saleless lettuce or my red oak
leaf is not red anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: I go in, I test it, the molybdenum is at
zero or 0.001 or something abysmally low.
[SPEAKER_06]: I dose the molybdenum back up to like 0.8
parts per gallon.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can dose it as high as one parts per
million, but for the most part,
[SPEAKER_06]: we're using dosing between 0.1 and 0.4,
but if it's straight at zero and the
[SPEAKER_06]: plants have to deplete what's in the water
column to replace it because it's flat
[SPEAKER_06]: zero, then we'll dose it at like a 0.6 to
0.8 because the plants are going to
[SPEAKER_06]: immediately obliterate a large percentage
of that right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're trying to force those
purples, make sure you're dosing at like
[SPEAKER_06]: 0.1, 0.2 PPMs, when you flip the flower
and it's super simple.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you could buy like, you know,
a few grams of it and it'll last you,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, 10 grams of it will last most
growers five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it doesn't take very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, in the same aspect is the anthocyanins
with the red stem cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that just an excess of carotenoids and
what does that come from?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I, my honest answer is I'm not quite
sure on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a, a proper answer on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something we're going to have to look into
more.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know if it would be just how the
anthocyanins were expressing, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: where it didn't get a purple hue.
[SPEAKER_04]: It got more of a red hue kind of like when
you get a lavender bud versus like a black
[SPEAKER_04]: ass bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, something like that versus like the
Indian red stems where, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: oranges and reds are more associated with
the carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that production happening for the same
type of reason that there was some
[SPEAKER_04]: something that was locking it out or an
excess of?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, again, that's just something I'm,
my knowledge is, uh, that's not as good
[SPEAKER_06]: on, so I don't want to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hidden the bong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll join you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you smoking on over there,
Steve?
[SPEAKER_02]: Apples and banana by, uh, chat tree garden
in Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Panda wants to know what size
reservoir pond would be suitable for
[SPEAKER_04]: starting out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, it just depends on what you're trying
to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're trying to grow cannabis,
I wouldn't do anything smaller than a 40
[SPEAKER_06]: gallon aquarium for one or two plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: That seems to be the kind of the extreme
end of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could maybe get away with a 29 gallon.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you really heavily stocked it,
um, that's going to be the extreme end on
[SPEAKER_06]: the small side.
[SPEAKER_06]: And after that, you know, kind of anything
up from there, you need about a 75 or 90
[SPEAKER_06]: gallon tank if you want to do four,
four plants, um, and then kind of.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, up from there, depending on what
it is that you're trying to grow or how
[SPEAKER_06]: many plants are trying to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am obscene.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just absolutely jealous that you
got to see all those ruins in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a huge ruins person.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter where we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see the history of that area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't see anything more beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really into Egyptian culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So ruins like that are old Egyptian,
uh, uh, pyramids, caves, tunnels,
[SPEAKER_04]: anything like that, even the tip,
the cave in Romania, just any of that old
[SPEAKER_04]: folklore.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I saw you post pictures of the
Thai temple, I automatically went fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomb Raider, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I want to see this shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: How was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like it'd be spiritual just being
on those grounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the temples that you saw were the old
ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, there's a new one that that's
close to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's up in patchaboon.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's beautiful, but it's not that kind
of inspiring the way the old ones are,
[SPEAKER_06]: but the old ones are all Khmer ruins.
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are exactly from the same,
um, temple complex as the, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: the stuff in Tomb Raider.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually filmed over Angkor Wat,
which is the exact same kingdom.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just down another 200 miles or 300
miles to the east from where that temple
[SPEAKER_06]: was, but that's the far end of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that, that whole temple complex used to
go from Cambodia all the way into
[SPEAKER_06]: Thailand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you look in one of the pictures,
there's a stairwell stair set that kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: goes down and then back up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see it just kind of go off
into the, the, the horizon that goes all
[SPEAKER_06]: the way to Angkor Wat.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can walk from that temple all the way
to Angkor Wat in Cambodia, obviously with
[SPEAKER_06]: the border crossing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, you can actually physically walk
the same ancient path that, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: people did, you know, a thousand years ago
to get there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, interesting culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're completely separate from the,
uh, more modern Khmer that maybe have less
[SPEAKER_06]: of a PR, uh, less of a favorable PR,
uh, to say the least.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but, uh, the, uh, uh, the temples
there are just incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just again, like you're talking about
huge ancient trees, like growing out of,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, three, 400 year old tree growing
out of the side of a temple, like
[SPEAKER_06]: especially the second temple that I went
to seeing these giant trees kind of like
[SPEAKER_06]: shading the reflection pools and like
just, I was just so cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's one of my favorite parts of
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's another one that I haven't
gone to yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like, I guess, was like one of the
stables for the elephant warriors and
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, it's one of the ones I want to see,
but a lot of it's kind of collapsed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more ruined than some of the other
ones, but, uh, it was where they had the
[SPEAKER_06]: war elephants and stuff, which is super
cool because, uh, especially on Buriram,
[SPEAKER_06]: that was where they used to, you know,
breed and raise the war elephants and
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: When they would go to war and they had
these giant like towers on top of the
[SPEAKER_06]: elephants.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'd have like two levels of archers
firing off the back of the elephants and
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: They create way crazier than the stuff you
see in your video games.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you, if you do, we would love to see
some pictures of that, me especially.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I saw your video on the rat roulette.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else have you seen over there that
might blow my mind?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to think on that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, just watching tourists interact with
monkeys is hilarious because the macaques
[SPEAKER_06]: totally know how to like punk tourists.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's always really hilarious.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in fact, if you saw on the news,
there was a temple where all the monks got
[SPEAKER_06]: arrested for doing meth.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was one of the monkey temples that's
near me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was a monkey temple.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was like, well, all the monkeys on
meth too, because that'd be pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, that was definitely one of the
interesting, um, the snake temple and,
[SPEAKER_06]: and, um, Bangkok is pretty insane just in
terms of like, wow, that exists.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so they have a temple for cobras in
downtown Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, it's like, uh, you go down the
street and then suddenly one of like the
[SPEAKER_06]: front faces of the like regular street
front is a temple, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So you walk through and there's like a
gift shop and all this kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can buy eggs or raw chicken
and other stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's like baskets with rope
against the railing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can put your, you can buy your
offering and put that in there and then
[SPEAKER_06]: lower it down into this courtyard,
which is out the back of the temple.
[SPEAKER_06]: And inside the, behind all these buildings
is a courtyard and it's filled with all
[SPEAKER_06]: the cobras and pythons and snakes they
find throughout Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_06]: People put them there as like this temple
place.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's like hundreds of cobras in the
middle of downtown and people like feeding
[SPEAKER_06]: them eggs and chickens on ropes with
baskets.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the strangest thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I've never seen anything like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had so many like venomous creatures and
everyone's just like chill about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I've never seen anything like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And once a while too, someone will come
walking through the temple.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like holding a snake by the head to like
put into the pit, you know, that they
[SPEAKER_06]: caught somewhere around town.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you never, like, you got to really pay
attention there because someone could come
[SPEAKER_06]: up behind you with a cobra in their hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like about walking on eggshells.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, the food here is amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll see some stuff that you definitely
don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen mongoose at the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen, I saw you eat that larva,
that silkworm.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are good, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I eat them all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll put them in pasta or in rice.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are super yummy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It tastes like a water chestnuts with like
a little more of a nutty flavor,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's a good compliment to like a
starch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like water chestnuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like it's the texture.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's gotta be like some juicy guts in
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: The little ones are not bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's bigger ones, like the water bugs
and stuff that have like texture issue
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the fruit here, there's one
that I love the flavor of, but it's
[SPEAKER_06]: seriously like eating a ball of snot.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you eat the inside, all around the
seed is like a big ball.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have some in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just grab them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what the English word is.
[SPEAKER_05]: They look like an evil strawberry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, on the inside, they're real snotty,
but they're super flavorful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they look kind of like a old man
ball sack version of a strawberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Panda said he had an arowana.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, arowana is a great man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to work in the pet trade before I
worked in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's how I got into cannabis is they
had a grow room downstairs and we,
[SPEAKER_06]: the blue arowana is back in the black
arowana is back in the day used to be
[SPEAKER_06]: quite pricey.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now they have all kinds of fancy ones
or scribble lines and super reds and
[SPEAKER_06]: albinos and platinums.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are the ones that go like the
scribbles and stuff go for 60,000 plus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the fancy long fins and stuff can
go for 80,000 plus.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't ask you about, and usually I ask
my guests, uh, what is your history with
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty insane to lead on.
[SPEAKER_04]: You worked at a pet store with the,
can we talk about it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the East coast, um, a lot of the pet
trade was, well, it probably still is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, used as a front, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So they use it to trickle their money,
especially aquarium maintenance companies.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not uncommon for them to have 50% or
more of the customers be on paper only.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, that that's a common thing,
allegedly, uh, in the book I'm writing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, the, uh, so I used to work at this
place called pet fantasy.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was a kid, there was a,
um, a pet store that was like one of the
[SPEAKER_06]: only places that was close enough for my
house that I could just go on my own,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd hang out there all the,
all the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I was 12 years old, I caught one
of the employees stealing cash out of the
[SPEAKER_06]: register.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I told the owner cause like he's my
homie and he went and like drained the
[SPEAKER_06]: kid's pockets and found the cash and fired
him and was like, well, you're honest and
[SPEAKER_06]: you know where all the animals are and how
to take care of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want a job?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got hired that day, uh, and ended up
working there for about a year.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then one day I like couldn't find the
boss to go down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I knew there was like a basement that
I'd never been in and they had a whole row
[SPEAKER_06]: and, you know, a separate room with a
whole bunch of other animals that were not
[SPEAKER_06]: on the list upstairs and, uh, got exposed
to a whole new world that I didn't know
[SPEAKER_06]: existed yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then from there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got into the gross scene at a pretty young
age back in the East coast.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then from there later on moved up
into, um, a different company.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, well, how do I put it?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it working for the long story short,
I ended up working for the army post
[SPEAKER_06]: office.
[SPEAKER_06]: And while I was working for the army post
office, I, uh, met one of the guys from
[SPEAKER_06]: USPS and we got talking eventually kind of
realized we were both stoners.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you hung out one day, he invited me
over and we smoked like three hat,
[SPEAKER_06]: like, like hash pucks, like the Keef
pucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, you grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, how the fuck do you know
that?
[SPEAKER_06]: And he goes, you just smoked three Keef
pucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody else that, that like, except for
growers would have that tolerance or that
[SPEAKER_06]: access to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to stuff because come here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he invites me into his garage and he
had a big fucking full garage full of
[SPEAKER_06]: plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the nicest plants I had ever seen
them like way beyond what I had done in
[SPEAKER_06]: terms of like quality and all the rest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, after a little while,
like working with him after a couple of
[SPEAKER_06]: months, he's like, go to this property
here and I'll meet you there like whatever
[SPEAKER_06]: time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I get there and there's a barn and it's
two stories of plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, and that was the first
time I ever saw like a thousand or more
[SPEAKER_06]: plants like in one place.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was super cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, worked with him for a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I didn't know working for a
landscaping company and they had a big
[SPEAKER_06]: grow and whether greenhouses as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, that was kind of on the DL.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, I ended up kind of continuing on
my agricultural journey that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when, uh, I had an opportunity to
move to Colorado, um, but my father was
[SPEAKER_06]: still sick with cancer and I had to
decline it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like really bummed because I
really wanted to go grow weed legally.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of wanted to go legit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then about eight months later,
my dad had finally finished his cancer
[SPEAKER_06]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was like clean, you know, freeing in
the clear with his stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got an opportunity to go back to
that same job offer that had been given a
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had fired the original guy that they
had hired that instead of me and offered
[SPEAKER_06]: me this job back again.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I took that went out to Colorado and
then, uh, kind of killed it out there,
[SPEAKER_06]: worked for a couple of places there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when the floods happened to
Colorado, uh, the place I was working for
[SPEAKER_06]: had the whole back wall get blown out by
mud because of the landslides and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, I lost my job there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and basically it was told like,
Hey, we'll hire you back when we finally
[SPEAKER_06]: get a facility again, but you know,
go work for somebody else for now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I ended up applying to the aquaponics
source.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got hired there for product development.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, eventually after two weeks got,
uh, switched over to their cannabis and,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, and research lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, once she realized what my experience
was and we developed the whole aquaponics
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis program there at the aquaponics
source for a couple of years, we did a
[SPEAKER_06]: test runs both, um, in our, we had a 50 by
30 greenhouse that we had off,
[SPEAKER_06]: off site, uh, that was fully licensed,
which was really nice that we kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: tinker.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had like waking beds and flood and
drain beds and DWC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we, we tried to experiment with like
all the different ways you could grow it
[SPEAKER_06]: and kind of see what was going to work
best, how to dial it in, like,
[SPEAKER_06]: cause we didn't know, you know,
at that time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just did a punch, a bunch of R and D
with a bunch of different types of setups.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we kind of figured out what worked,
which was the dual root zone setups or,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, SIPP setups.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to do a real big scale
doing it, SIPPs makes a little bit more
[SPEAKER_06]: sense labor wise, but on the smaller
scale, dual root zones are especially
[SPEAKER_06]: certainly for your moms.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you can push growth much better with
the dual root zones.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, why is it the smaller scale is better
for the dual root zone besides the roots?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just from a labor standpoint, um,
you know, you're doing 14,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can absolutely do a dual root zone,
but it's just a little more time on the
[SPEAKER_06]: pots.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all, um, you know, when you're
doing it's a acre scale, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it starts to be a little less,
uh, what would be that threshold where you
[SPEAKER_06]: would change from one or the other,
about a quarter acre, half acre,
[SPEAKER_06]: then it starts to make a little more sense
to do it the other way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, it depends on your labor costs
in Thailand or Africa.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like you're breaking the bank,
um, on, on, you know, labor costs per
[SPEAKER_06]: plant, but in this U S it's a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, that would be the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, so after they're working with
the aquaponics source, they eventually,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, came in one day after they recently
sold the company and the new owners wanted
[SPEAKER_06]: nothing to do with cannabis because it
was, uh, becoming problematic for their
[SPEAKER_06]: accounting, which it used to be very much
so, uh, up until pretty recently.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, and even still is a problem
depending on what, what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, they basically, uh, gave me that
part of the company and told me to get
[SPEAKER_06]: fucked.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, uh, you know, kind of as a
severance and, uh, and that was that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I started my own consulting company and
since then of in 2016, 2015, 2016,
[SPEAKER_06]: 2016.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and.
[SPEAKER_06]: February of 2016.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, since then I've been going around
the planet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't ask for a better life,
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: If, if you had told me I'd gone to Africa
and Southeast Asia and all over to grow
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was 16 years old, I've been like,
you're crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's amazing, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: What an accomplishment out of all the
places that you've gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we say a favorite?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a favorite?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a close one between Jamaica and
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I love beach life in Jamaica and
Jamaica gets a bad rap.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the cities definitely can be rough
and not pleasant.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll put it that way, but the nicest
people I've ever met in my whole fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: life, aside from people here in Thailand,
they're equal equally as nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, we're in rural Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we had our car breakdown between St.
Mary's and Kingston in like the back
[SPEAKER_06]: middle of nowhere in the mountains taking
the long route, not the highway route that
[SPEAKER_06]: exists now.
[SPEAKER_06]: That didn't exist when we were doing this,
the freeway that goes to Kingston now from
[SPEAKER_06]: Ocho.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, our car broke down and we're in the
middle of nowhere on like a two lane road
[SPEAKER_06]: with just enough area on the shoulder to
like get the car so that we're not in
[SPEAKER_06]: traffic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these two guys appear out of nowhere
after about 35 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're like all holding something that
could be like a weapon because we don't
[SPEAKER_06]: know what, what these guys want.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they just offered to help us.
[SPEAKER_06]: They helped try to repair the car.
[SPEAKER_06]: It becomes clear that we have a broken
part and that we need to go buy a piece
[SPEAKER_06]: for the car.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're like, cool, you can't go
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come back to our house.
[SPEAKER_06]: They kicked their kids out of their beds
and gave us a place to sleep.
[SPEAKER_06]: They fed us, smoked us out, gave us beers,
got us sleep in their house.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't know us at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let us sleep in their house for the night.
[SPEAKER_06]: Woke us up in the morning, gave us
breakfast, drove us to town to get parts,
[SPEAKER_06]: came back, help us fix the car.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we went to Kingston on our way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, tell me a single place in the U S
where that would happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the level of kindness you have in
Thailand is the same way, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you have people that are infinitely
grateful for, for, for everything in life
[SPEAKER_06]: and happy to help you with whatever you
need.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have a problem and you don't have
that kind of selflessness with Western
[SPEAKER_06]: culture, it doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people do, but as a whole,
not as like go to any rural area and
[SPEAKER_06]: you're going to be treated like that in
Jamaica and Thailand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And absolutely is like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's extend to Zimbabwe was a lot
like that too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, anywhere where you have people that
just don't have a whole lot community and,
[SPEAKER_06]: and kindness matters a lot more in life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it makes the world a better
place for the foundations of life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, before we get going here, I've got a
couple more questions for you and then
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll get headed out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, breeder Steve really, I wanted to give
him a shout out really quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: He mentioned you the other day and I had
listened to your podcast before and I was
[SPEAKER_04]: like, Steve, yeah, I got to get him on for
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was saying what a great job you were
doing out there and that he really
[SPEAKER_04]: appreciated the work that you were doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so congratulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a high honor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I saw you post about a ton of bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You hadn't, you'd mentioned the snakes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw you holding the f*****g scorpion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not scared of many things,
but I don't know if I would hold a f*****g
[SPEAKER_04]: scorpion or that other, uh, was it called
a vingeroon?
[SPEAKER_06]: Vingeroon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as I was talking about earlier,
I worked in the pet trade, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we used to have venomous snakes and
scorpions and spiders and tarantulas.
[SPEAKER_06]: So none of that stuff phases me at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: So with the exception of like black mambas
or maybe a king cobra, the only thing sort
[SPEAKER_06]: of like, okay, maybe I'm just going to sit
back and take a long range picture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else, I'm going to go pick it up
and get a picture and be holding it
[SPEAKER_06]: because that's what I like to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, and I've held all kinds of crazy
shit that you should never hold that,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, whatever, but I've only been
tagged by vine snakes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've only paid for it twice in both times
or by a snake that it was pretty mild.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, I'm not overly concerned about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I I'm pretty confident in my abilities to
handle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dangerous animals and have been doing it
since I was a child.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not, I'm not overly worried about
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not about to go, go play with a
bear.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a, I do have two wolf dogs that
eventually there's a limit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have two wolf hybrids as pets that
are back in the Colorado or Oklahoma right
[SPEAKER_06]: now that need to come out here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't quite sorted out the logistics
on yet, but I'm going to wait till the
[SPEAKER_06]: election.
[SPEAKER_06]: As I was saying before, I'm not going to
bring them over here till the election
[SPEAKER_06]: happens just because I need to know
exactly whether or not this is going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: a long-term thing or not, but assuming the
election goes pleasantly, um, pretty much
[SPEAKER_06]: posted up here in Thailand for the
foreseeable future, because the pay is
[SPEAKER_06]: nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: The cost of living is nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: The food is incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the people here are really nice
that right now the industry can support,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, at least for awhile is going to
be pretty, pretty profitable.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't, uh, I don't see a reason to
come back to the States, especially until
[SPEAKER_06]: you guys have your election, which I don't
think is going to be very funny either.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't feel like they really have been
for like fucking 20 years now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I watched Trump get elected from
Jamaica and that was, uh, that was
[SPEAKER_06]: entertaining to say the least.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mind milled a lot on that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go back before we get ourselves
in trouble with politics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you've seen these crazy ass bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've seen, uh, well, I guess a scorpion.
[SPEAKER_04]: What does that count as?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know pandas in here too.
[SPEAKER_04]: He knows all of his fucking.
[SPEAKER_06]: And animals was that a scorpions,
you mean scorpions, the vinegar runes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are arachnids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, same as spiders.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything with eight legs.
[SPEAKER_04]: What has changed with your IPM program
that you've not experienced before here in
[SPEAKER_06]: Thailand, I can tell you firsthand,
we have three species here that are immune
[SPEAKER_06]: to most things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, there's one threat species here that
seems to only react to white oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the only, which is equivalent
to soft oil acts in the States.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, that's the only thing that seems to
knock them back.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've hit them with over eight
different bio-controls, but very bossy on
[SPEAKER_06]: a multiple strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: I say, if you went to race a better isium,
um, militaris, like you name it,
[SPEAKER_06]: any of the normal go-to's we've thrown
heavy dose.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking like four times the normal
dose and they still can't get them to
[SPEAKER_06]: zero.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, that's been probably the first in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cordyceps Adam too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, everything you can think of.
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't work at all here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely saw some infection,
but the infection rate was like 20%
[SPEAKER_06]: instead of like 90%.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like really, really heavily immune to
pretty much everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they made it to the States,
y'all are fucked.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, especially if they get established
in the South or SoCal, like do not take
[SPEAKER_06]: cuts from anybody and fucking Thailand.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's growing outdoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to go ahead and say that,
like, cause if you bring this shit to the
[SPEAKER_06]: States, you guys are going to cry hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to tell you that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, worse than they also have a,
um, they have a broad might here that
[SPEAKER_06]: makes Russet mics look cute.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, they have a broad might here that's
smaller than the normal broad bites in the
[SPEAKER_06]: States that is like significantly smaller
than the ones in the States, but it looks
[SPEAKER_06]: identical.
[SPEAKER_06]: They carry the girlfriends around on the
back legs, same way and everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, just like a broad might
does, but they're smaller than any of the
[SPEAKER_06]: ones I've ever photographed in the U S.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so that's another one, but they're
easily smashed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the two rows I've visited to have
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were able to get rid of them after 30
days with just using white oil and heavy
[SPEAKER_06]: defoliation and, and just, you know,
cleaning the place up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then taking clones from that once
they knocked it back to just to restart,
[SPEAKER_06]: to make sure everything was clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, that's, that's not been a problem,
but, um, definitely something that if you
[SPEAKER_06]: didn't know what you're looking at and
you're looking for them, you're not going
[SPEAKER_06]: to see them with your eyeballs,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: They're, they're simply too small.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to scope them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's, I have a little handy scope
that I got the $30 scope you can get from
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazon.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great because you can carry it
around, spray it with alcohol or whatever,
[SPEAKER_06]: disaffected between you go between
different rooms and you, and you don't
[SPEAKER_06]: care.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it works great.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Hey, if you drop it or break it or it
gets wet, I'm out 30 bucks, like moving
[SPEAKER_06]: deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I use that all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have my tablet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a big tablet and I just take that
and I scope it and I look at it on the
[SPEAKER_06]: tablet and I can make the picture,
you know, the size of a normal sheet of
[SPEAKER_06]: paper.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I could go through the grow
really rapidly and scout and, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes my life so much easier.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have to take leaves from the grow
into the lab and put it on the microscope.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have something that I really want
to check out further that I do that with,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it just helps me reduce the amount of
material moving around the farm and
[SPEAKER_06]: improves the speed of scouting because you
know, scouting always takes one to two
[SPEAKER_06]: hours a day or more, you know,
at any facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, the faster that you can accurately
and very carefully go through a grow like
[SPEAKER_06]: that and have that kind of instant
picture, because if I did have a spider in
[SPEAKER_06]: mind or a russet might or a broad might
come in off of somebody's clothes or
[SPEAKER_06]: something, I can detect it while it's
still at that super manageable level
[SPEAKER_06]: before it's now causing plant damage or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: All those kinds of mites, you need to
catch them before you've seen the damage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, you already have a huge uphill
battle.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, before we get going here, what are
your top three favorite strains of all
[SPEAKER_04]: time?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're on a desert Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go, you can pick three things to take
with you, Steve.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stuff I've grown.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Warlock was really good in Colorado
for purple strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just had a really good depth of profile
on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, remember that name.
[SPEAKER_06]: Next up, next up would be, I'm a big fan
of the red Lebanese puck that we have from
[SPEAKER_06]: crickets and cicada.
[SPEAKER_06]: That one's really, really fire.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the, uh, banana something or other the
dragonfly had, and I can't remember what
[SPEAKER_07]: it was called.
[SPEAKER_07]: Banana something.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that, uh, fuck, I can't remember the
name of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's banana something or other,
but it was dragon fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: The medicine had it and it, I smoked that
and it was like 16 or 17%.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was fucked up.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the first time I ever had one,
a strain that I knew for a fact,
[SPEAKER_06]: it wasn't nearly as potent as some of the
other ones I had smoked that morning,
[SPEAKER_06]: but that terpene profile just like rung my
bell.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's when I realized like,
Oh, the terp profile was like 70% of the
[SPEAKER_06]: experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was my first like jarring
experience of that whole thing at Emerald
[SPEAKER_06]: cup one day in the tents there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Above those ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt the exact same way about the
Egyptian Sinai.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one was really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think that was, uh,
I believe the original preservationist
[SPEAKER_04]: said that he did test some and he was
getting some that was like peeking out at
[SPEAKER_04]: like 22, 23%, which was incredible for a
land race.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it had just been cultivated as a drug
type for so long.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was what they were pushing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But most of them were in that like 16 to
18 area and fuck, they just rip you off
[SPEAKER_04]: your ass.
[SPEAKER_06]: The best thing lately has been the Dawn
mega Larry chimes that we got from Dutch
[SPEAKER_06]: blooms.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, that's really been of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only one that we've kept more
than two phenos.
[SPEAKER_06]: We kept four phenos of that one because we
just had four really different bomb smells
[SPEAKER_06]: that were like unique enough to,
to, to preserve and just.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really good depth of terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has like six or seven or eight
different notes in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just one flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like you're sitting there trying to
like analyze all the flavors that are in
[SPEAKER_06]: your mouth right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then those are hard to find.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially with a lot of the ball necking
that's going on right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you feel like the future of land
races is?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, saying that, you know,
most land races now are trash.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going back to hemp with the open
park.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're pollinating.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's high herm rates.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of them are contaminated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think there is a future for
preservation of land race strains as pure
[SPEAKER_04]: strains?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you think that cannabis is pushing
in such a direction forward that it's kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of becoming obsolete?
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, I kind of look at them like,
um, they're like the paint that like Bob
[SPEAKER_06]: Ross uses to make a painting, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you need to have the good base color
paints with the base colors that you need
[SPEAKER_06]: to make the painting and the blends and
the things that you need.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we don't have those base colors,
we can't make the happy little trees in
[SPEAKER_06]: the mountains, but you know, all that
stuff, it just won't work, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't get the color right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that preserving them from a
point of like, Hey, we're not going to use
[SPEAKER_06]: these as like F ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to use them as breed stock,
but maintaining them as breed stock stuff,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think is certainly important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I honestly, I think in 40 or 50 years,
there isn't going to be a whole lot left
[SPEAKER_06]: because people are kind of scraping the
earth for what's left right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, also these other markets,
cannabis is becoming more and more
[SPEAKER_06]: legalized.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're getting more and more access to
Western genetics and a lot of these remote
[SPEAKER_06]: areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, that's going to further,
you know, diminish that, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: for the good or the worst, but a lot of
the Western stuff just fries.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, shit, you take any Indica and you
put it out here in full sun, it'll melt.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, any of the, almost all the
blueberry stuff, except for the blueberry
[SPEAKER_06]: OG that we grew melts in the sun here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of stuff, you don't put it under
a sun shade.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll just, just like.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you know, 60% of the stuff in the West
that you grow indoor can't handle the sun
[SPEAKER_06]: here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just won't, won't handle it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, you know, a lot of the stuff,
I think people are also breeding is super
[SPEAKER_06]: weak and I could see them just breeding to
the point where everything is so fragile,
[SPEAKER_06]: especially on the indoor side,
that like, it just becomes extremely hard
[SPEAKER_06]: just to do production.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the extreme heat that we're talking
about?
[SPEAKER_04]: What would be the conversion rate on
temperature?
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's 107 here during the day pretty
regularly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then, you know, tropical sun is
much hotter in terms of how much it's
[SPEAKER_06]: heating the leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, it just plows through the water
and the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you don't, anything wide leaf just
doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_06]: We use sun shades.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have 50% sun shades that come on at
about 10 o'clock at nine 30, 10 o'clock in
[SPEAKER_06]: the morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and then they, they roll back at about
three, 34 o'clock, depending on the
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, uh, that helps shield them from
the worst of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, you trash the strains
that don't like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of stuff will auto flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've had another six or eight strains
that just instantly went to flower as soon
[SPEAKER_06]: as they, uh, you know, we're in veg
beyond, you know, a month or two.
[SPEAKER_04]: I imagine that, uh, circulation air would
be a huge priority as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know having extra fans is another key
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every single pole in the greenhouse is a
fan on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't go every other, um, you know,
with the, uh, with the fans because it's
[SPEAKER_06]: simply too hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to keep the air movement.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the other bit of it is too,
we're in rice fields, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you have a normal, you know,
right now it's the end of the dry season,
[SPEAKER_06]: but during the wet season, like the other
half of the year, it's a lake around us.
[SPEAKER_06]: All every direction is water, you know,
it's, you know, ain't need knee deep in
[SPEAKER_06]: water.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to have that air movement for
mold, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't have good air movement,
those plants will rot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing with, you can't have like God,
but it's not going to work here,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't do big giant dense coal or super
dense, like Afghan stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just not going to do well here because
it's going to rot, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to have stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's either small or slightly fluffy in
order to actually finish the runoff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise everything melts.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing you get here is,
uh, like the leaves will cook off and
[SPEAKER_06]: you'll get kind of the browning on the
ends of the leaves from being too dry,
[SPEAKER_06]: not replacing the water fast enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's a mold that'll start to
attack those.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it'll go back into the bud too,
which I've never seen that before,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, except for here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, you know, you've got all kinds of
stuff that you have to mitigate
[SPEAKER_06]: constantly, um, on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, that just comes down to being
proactive.
[SPEAKER_06]: You spray the plants every other day with
either an insect spray, uh, and then a day
[SPEAKER_06]: off or so, you know, Monday you spray for
insects day off Wednesday, you spray for
[SPEAKER_06]: mold day off, you know, Friday you spray
for insects again, and you just rinse
[SPEAKER_06]: repeat.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that seems to keep everything at bay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, in terms of that, we also use wood
vinegar, which is something I wanted to
[SPEAKER_06]: bring up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, you don't hear anybody use that in the
States.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know if it's allowed in the
States, but it's just, uh, basically,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, vinegar that's been, um, they take,
uh, like mesquite and they run mesquite
[SPEAKER_06]: through a giant vat of vinegar,
almost like a bong.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it like, um, flavors the vinegar to
smell like wood smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we sprayed that on the plants and it,
the bugs hate that shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it gives the plants like a vigor,
like the plants really liked the,
[SPEAKER_06]: the different compounds that are within
the vinegar and they different,
[SPEAKER_06]: they're greener, they're all praying the
next day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the plants are very happy when you
spray that on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and the bugs hate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's something that we use everybody
in Thailand use.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like a standard practice
agricultural product that, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: the mites don't like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The white flies don't like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's just good for keeping everything
off the plants, more as a preventative
[SPEAKER_06]: than a treatment.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're regularly applying it,
it helps kind of keep the bugs out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, it's something that I was kind of
curious and I'd love to talk to an
[SPEAKER_06]: agricultural expert at some point on why
we don't have an equivalent product in the
[SPEAKER_06]: U S.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing that's pretty unique about
Thailand is that so, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: in the United States, you don't,
you have to have single, um, single agent
[SPEAKER_06]: bio controls.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to have just Bivariobaciana or
just Metarysium or just Isaria
[SPEAKER_06]: Fumiciraceae, uh, or what's it,
uh, Cordyceps Fumiciraceae now,
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they just changed the name of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, in Thailand, you can have multiple
ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: We, we actually, our main product is a
Bivariobaciana Metarysium, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: comp at the two of them are pre-mixed
together.
[SPEAKER_06]: We mixed that with, um, Bectilis
Thurigensis BT, uh, and that gives us a
[SPEAKER_06]: really good broad spectrum, three in one
control that we can apply in one shot,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, one labor, one, one labor
payment and everything has been sprayed
[SPEAKER_06]: with three different types of bio
controls, which is great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and they don't have any kind of
negative impact on each other's
[SPEAKER_06]: populations on application.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you can't do that in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I don't even know if you could
legally do it as an application on a,
[SPEAKER_06]: on a, you know, monitor crop, you know,
because they want to see that individual,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, activated bio control for whatever
crazy reason, same way that like the U S
[SPEAKER_06]: stuck on monomolecular pharmacology,
you know, they don't want compound
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine is a huge pain in the ass in the
United States, especially if you're trying
[SPEAKER_06]: to get anything approved.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, it's why you can't,
it's so hard to get like cannabis plus a
[SPEAKER_06]: terpene, even though we know damn well,
Leninolol plus CBD plus THC, suppression
[SPEAKER_06]: of seizures in children.
[SPEAKER_06]: The FDA won't approve that because they
want to see that Leninolol is safe and
[SPEAKER_06]: does it for children and that THC does it
and it's safe for children and CBD does it
[SPEAKER_06]: as safe for children.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, the combination of them gets rid
of the psychoactive activity of the THC
[SPEAKER_06]: and suppresses the seizures, but you have
to make all three together.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't certifying them individually.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't, you know, the, the parts
don't, don't equal the sum of the total
[SPEAKER_06]: combined.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can't get the drug approved that
stops seizures in children, which is
[SPEAKER_06]: fucking crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's fucking loco.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like anything that gets in the way of that
should be like just obliterated.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should immediately in the same way we
will flood every gas station with
[SPEAKER_04]: non-effective CBD derivative.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Delta eight, and don't forget about
all the, all the no-dose caffeine that
[SPEAKER_06]: causes over 18,000 accidents a year that
they never fucking bring up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, why are we not regulating that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, we could talk about
statistics on what's killing people in the
[SPEAKER_06]: U S and it's not the weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything that anybody that you'd
like to shout out before we get going?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If anybody wants to check me out,
we have the DAT smoke show on Wednesday
[SPEAKER_06]: evenings, um, the U S time at a usually
around seven 30 Pacific, sometimes a
[SPEAKER_06]: little earlier, sometimes a little later.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and that's over at that smoke show DAT
smoke show.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's more of a fun laid back,
hang out with a bunch of other growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of Thai people are on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're growing here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a really fun, looser,
you know, less formal show.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I have the growing with fishes
podcast on Thursday evenings.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's much more formal, more of an
interview style or a grow topic centric.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we're going to talk about this
today and go through that similar to the
[SPEAKER_06]: show, uh, where it's much more focused.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and you guys can also check out,
uh, the growing with fishes podcast on all
[SPEAKER_06]: platforms that are available out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing with that smoke show.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on all those, uh, and you can find
out any of my educational courses over at
[SPEAKER_06]: a PMJ class.com or the pest class.com.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to take formal class-based
education, I also run the open nutrient
[SPEAKER_06]: project, which is an open source product
program that we're working on that I've
[SPEAKER_06]: put together by myself on, um,
how to open source a lot of this stuff,
[SPEAKER_06]: because a lot of the Korean natural
farming people, uh, don't really have a
[SPEAKER_06]: good idea of the nutrient, um,
profile and what it is they're creating
[SPEAKER_06]: with those inputs.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the soil food web people don't
really know what the nutrient profile is,
[SPEAKER_06]: what their inputs are.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've kind of ignored that nutrient
component of the balance.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel like that's a kind of a big
thing that needs to be addressed because
[SPEAKER_06]: you can absolutely make a bad compost mix,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't have what the plants need
pretty easily if you don't know what
[SPEAKER_06]: plants need.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the idea is to create a centralized
database, streamline a lot of the work
[SPEAKER_06]: that like Dr. Duke's database has,
and some of the other things for getting
[SPEAKER_06]: the mineral content of these different
inputs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And input plants and input minerals into
one place with one list of testing so that
[SPEAKER_06]: you guys can go, okay, I'm going to pick
these plants from my property.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to pick these test kits to test
for testing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I can test my own inputs at my
own house, my own farm without having to
[SPEAKER_06]: rely on third parties.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that, you know, so trying to give the
power back to the farmer, give the
[SPEAKER_06]: knowledge back to the farmer so they can
create their own inputs with actual
[SPEAKER_06]: knowledge on what it's going to look like
on a nutrient profile on the backend,
[SPEAKER_06]: be it natural farming.
[SPEAKER_06]: KNF, GDOM or whatever else also has links
to preparations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can submit your own parts per
million testing through that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those open source database that has
what other people have created their
[SPEAKER_06]: recipes and, you know, what nutrient
profiles they found with their ferments
[SPEAKER_06]: and teas and other inputs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of trying to drive this,
you know, more open source data stuff to
[SPEAKER_06]: take it away from some of the Monsanto's
and other people, because that was one of
[SPEAKER_06]: the big things I've seen traveling the
world is that we could totally solve a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of these farmers problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can get them off of this fertilizer
addiction and onto something they can
[SPEAKER_06]: create on their farms.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these farmers are super rich in
natural resources.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just don't know how to convert them
into fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we can just fix that gap and
translate it into many languages,
[SPEAKER_06]: you could have a really big impact on
fixing a lot of the stuff that the
[SPEAKER_06]: fertilizer companies are breaking right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gigantic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what got me into Korean
natural farming.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you've heard me speak on
it before, but I grew up in an
[SPEAKER_04]: agriculture, more of a fruit farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Apples, pears, pears, cherries,
apricot, all kinds of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And seeing the chemicals that they were
required to spray on a constant schedule
[SPEAKER_04]: and the grounds just looking worse and
worse and it's getting compact and barren
[SPEAKER_04]: and nothing lives there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, there's gotta be a better,
cheaper way than this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if you're using, you know,
really expensive fertilizers like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: that are 90% water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Diluting them down further, killing your
microbiome and then expecting awesome
[SPEAKER_04]: results, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you do have a shit crop,
then you paid a bunch on those,
[SPEAKER_04]: that different nutrients, spray schedule,
that IPM and you're out a ton of money
[SPEAKER_04]: because your crop sucked as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it shouldn't be like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You shouldn't, you should be able to grow
good tasting organic weed for pennies on
[SPEAKER_04]: the dollar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you should have fun doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it often doesn't have any flavor
because there's no microbes to stimulate
[SPEAKER_06]: the flavonoid and terpene production in
the root system.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the plants taste like cardboard when
they grow them that way too, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: We are definitely gonna talk more about
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we can get you on for another podcast,
I'd love to have you on again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that you said you had a bunch of
new methods that you're doing with KNF.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I've been doing the basics that
I've learned from Chris.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'd be really cool to deep dive into
that with you and see what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you'd be willing to come on for another
podcast sometime.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd love to talk about a ton of different
R&D stuff we've been working on here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can check out the latest video
that we did on IPMO over on my YouTube
[SPEAKER_06]: channel.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have an 18 minute guide on how to do
that start to finish.
[SPEAKER_06]: So check that out over there too if you
wanted to see some of the previews and
[SPEAKER_06]: some of the cool new stuff we've been
cooking up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was a big shout out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks again to Chris.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was the one who taught me that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So going back to your mentor as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for your time again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate having you on.
