[SPEAKER_02]: Evening everyone and welcome to a brand
new episode of the Calix and crew podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: sessions I'm sitting here today with Jacob
Rolfe known better as Jacob Collins from
[SPEAKER_02]: trailer park boys He's also an illustrator
a cook a printmaker and all-around great
[SPEAKER_02]: guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing today, Jake?
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going doc?
[SPEAKER_02]: How's the weather up in Nova Scotia today?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lovely day nice that nice ocean
breeze not too muggy I I see you're you're
[SPEAKER_02]: already smoking up Probably the quickest
guest to light up ever What do you hold in
[SPEAKER_00]: that last few hours trying not to get too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Too high before you know coming online And
then you just start it right off the bat
[SPEAKER_02]: with the joint I'll light up with you
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm smoking on the seventh star from
dynasty genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a blue Magoo times huckleberry Who
sounds good?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've spoken some uh We've got like there's
legal weed here as well as the black
[SPEAKER_01]: market still, but I ran out of my The sort
of great area, you know smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought some government weed here,
but it's a nice cheap ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah if you had a preference the smoke
is there does Jacob have a Favorite strain
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite type man.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was this weed around it It was
before legalization and it was in some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the sort of like these black market shops
that were allowed to exist It's like
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated, but it was called pinky in
the brain So I don't know my genetics very
[SPEAKER_01]: well, but I think like the pink Pinks are
a realm of weed and I don't know what this
[SPEAKER_01]: was and I haven't like I've tried to
search it online and saw references To it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but no like that much info about it But
like whatever it was it it seemed to be it
[SPEAKER_01]: was like fireworks that stuff Everybody
over in chat right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll pay somebody a pack of seeds You look
up pinky in the brain find that strain for
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get it over to Jacob Yeah,
I was buying this shop in Toronto this
[SPEAKER_01]: like like chain of you know, little
illegal but tolerated head dope shops What
[SPEAKER_01]: were they called?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll call them great market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I kind of something something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember I was hoping to give it a
give it another clue there, but failed
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll overdub a shout out So how long have
you been smoking cannabis, but gosh I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: since Since grade 11 Grade 11.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I would have been about I guess
17 then yeah a junior High school like
[SPEAKER_01]: naming Conventions that you do it like
junior seniors and such right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so I don't know what I would be
called there But yeah, it was the third
[SPEAKER_01]: year of high school Okay, but we had also
that might complicate things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you recall that first experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we talk about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh the first smoke it was hash at a
party and my buddy a cook in the
[SPEAKER_01]: restaurant I was also working in the
kitchen Like I was young, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: underage having a couple of beers at this
You know work party and he like sitting
[SPEAKER_01]: there on the couch just pulled out this
chunk of hash He's like who checked this
[SPEAKER_01]: out and I had no idea what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like What do you got there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we spoke some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really remember how that went I
was already drunk so I might have just
[SPEAKER_01]: like ended up getting you know more more
effed up having a couple puffs off the
[SPEAKER_01]: hash joint, but The same dude hooked me up
with some weed after that and I was the
[SPEAKER_01]: first proper time smoking weed was up or
cannabis was you know that occasion and
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, again not knowing what I was doing I
tried me and my buddy went to see this
[SPEAKER_01]: band called all at Carleton University in
Ottawa and Yeah, we didn't even know how
[SPEAKER_01]: to roll joints But we each rolled sort of
like three joints really badly for
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves out of this, you know a little
bag of weed we got and I remember was the
[SPEAKER_01]: what I remember most was sitting like,
you know three meters apart from my buddy
[SPEAKER_01]: and we just smoked our three joints solo
like in a row, you know Not sharing or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything for some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why we're sitting so far
apart We smoked them all and then like
[SPEAKER_01]: went to see the concert And strangely I
didn't get too high that Experience,
[SPEAKER_02]: but what year are we talking here?
[SPEAKER_01]: This would have been like 92 something
like that 1992 All right that my neighbors
[SPEAKER_01]: mowing their lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not so that fuck for the audio It's
all good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can barely say there wasn't any
seeds in that But I don't think it was
[SPEAKER_01]: very good weed Because again oddly that
was like the one time we got weed back
[SPEAKER_01]: then then it was only hash for like a year
or two which weed was not making it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Ottawa like, you know seen But the hash
was pretty good got to you know learn
[SPEAKER_01]: about hash smoking hash joints doing
bottle tokes and then we you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually did come back onto the scene
and The rest is history, I guess Did that
[SPEAKER_02]: did Cannabis help play into your acting
career at all as far as developing
[SPEAKER_01]: characters Gosh, I mean my only acting job
has really been like right back like other
[SPEAKER_01]: than background work has been on trailer
park boys and I mean the Jacob the
[SPEAKER_01]: character I play Jacob Collins is You know
also sort of a stoner, you know kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: slacker type, dude Well, oh He does work
seven jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe he's not a slacker but sort of
slacker vibes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's constantly working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's constantly working So it feels
wrong calling a slacker But yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean there's certainly some overlap with
that with you know, the real Jacob in that
[SPEAKER_01]: regard So I guess you know, maybe it would
I'm able to easily tap into that You know
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of stoner but yes, so you're saying
it's not too far off from the real Jacob
[SPEAKER_02]: not too far at all if If the character
Jacob Collins could make meet Jacob Rolfe
[SPEAKER_02]: separately in a day What do you guys think
you'd do together for the rest of the day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah shit, I mean smoking some joints goes
without saying But yeah, I mean we both
[SPEAKER_01]: like little adventures Maybe go on a go on
a hike Low-grade trouble, what's low-grade
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not on the Ricky par not on Ricky bar
maybe some mild trespassing, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so when I first started talking to you
here Must have been like two years ago now
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw you post up a picture of two plants
that you had growing in your window there
[SPEAKER_02]: and I asked you about it and You said
yeah, you were growing a couple plants
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that your first experience growing or
have you grown previously?
[SPEAKER_01]: First time like I remember having a weed
in my window like Back in the 90s some
[SPEAKER_01]: some just bag seed I got and it was like a
male plant I had no idea till it started
[SPEAKER_01]: like dump in pollen everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to smoke that But yeah,
it was just and it was like a you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was getting basically no light But then
in in in University I was in my late 20s
[SPEAKER_01]: when I Like when this was going on me and
my roommates set up a grow room in the
[SPEAKER_01]: attic So we had to go up through this
cubby hole and one of the In in one dude's
[SPEAKER_01]: like closet and then we built a room up in
the attic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be you know out of sight and Yeah,
like like bought a bunch of equipment and
[SPEAKER_01]: had a hydroponic set up there one of the
dudes there had a bit of experience so he
[SPEAKER_01]: was definitely sort of like, you know
running things but like rest of us helped
[SPEAKER_01]: like lug water and like whatever,
you know watch out for the landlord Stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: his name wasn't Ricky was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I Mean that's pretty insane that that's
how it went, you know, you're doing water
[SPEAKER_02]: in this guy's making you Knows all the
goods from the army.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some good clones that we got And we
had yeah, but it worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we we got a bunch of good weed at
least from like from my perspective It was
[SPEAKER_01]: a you know planned up with four to six
ounces each and and there were four of
[SPEAKER_01]: them So, you know, it's pretty good for a
For a first bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember what any of those clones
were?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Gosh, no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no idea at all I don't really have a
head for like remembering such yeah such
[SPEAKER_02]: details and unfortunately So is this
something that you just do on and off in
[SPEAKER_02]: your free time or is this like a I'm gonna
grow for myself every year Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, I mean since living in in that house
at school, I guess I never really had my
[SPEAKER_01]: own place I mean I had places with Like
partners and stuff girlfriends,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we never had enough room to have a
grow room or and you never thought about
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know I guess actually growing
weed But but often I just didn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: space to do it and so not until I moved
back to Nova Scotia into this house I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: now where I've got like much extra rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Was finally like I'm gonna like,
you know grow some weed Yeah, and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, and and and so I did,
you know got me got me some lights a
[SPEAKER_01]: little grow tent and kind of Bumbled my
way through it And so I've been I've just
[SPEAKER_01]: been doing it like, you know one or two
cycles in the summers when I'm here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada I often travel in the winter so I
can't like just you know have a constantly
[SPEAKER_01]: rotating crop or anything But I'm it turns
out I'm not really good at it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like I enjoy it to a point like
sounds Where the plants get too like
[SPEAKER_01]: stressed looking it can be sort of a
stressful thing to have to deal with like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh man That's my job man is I teach people
how to grow and grow correctly And I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: believe there's a person on this planet
that has a brown thumb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's Unless you know that
subject which that's my subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I do is cannabis Unless you
know that subject and get into the details
[SPEAKER_02]: of how to take care of them best And make
that kind of like second memory,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know As far as what environment they
like what kind of medium they like what
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrition they like little tiny things it
gets easier The more you learn about it
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd be happy to help you with that if
you ever run the problems or anything Hit
[SPEAKER_02]: me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get you on track Well, thank you a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take you up on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not growing this summer I took this
summer off because I've got like a big
[SPEAKER_01]: backlog of like Because I the weed I grow
isn't that great I turn it into weed oil
[SPEAKER_01]: which which is like like Top-notch as far
as I'm concerned like that that stuff does
[SPEAKER_01]: the trick great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely Well, I do like being able to
like, you know have all this weed oil
[SPEAKER_01]: around but I've got so much now that I've
made from previous years and this summer
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sort of going and coming traveling
more that'd be tough to Sort of monitor my
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor, you know set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, I'm not growing this summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah next year I'll get back on the
train and Get some get some tips I'm kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of a lazy I I can be lazy sometimes like
when it comes to like Paying attention in
[SPEAKER_01]: a sustained way to something so I don't
know It could be a character flaw of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, I don't think so at
all Just sounds like you got ADHD and I
[SPEAKER_01]: think 90% of the people in here do Like it
is I sort of feel like the five years I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been doing it I've been trying to like
bring in An extra element and correct for
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I started off, you know with sort of,
you know Just the base super basics that I
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, bring in more like okay I'm
gonna get a pH Kit and like next year like
[SPEAKER_01]: okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna try to like be better with
temperature But I feel like I was getting
[SPEAKER_01]: worse every year somehow despite like
trying to pay attention to more things I
[SPEAKER_02]: think an unspoken part of growing That not
a lot of people mention is there's
[SPEAKER_02]: something spiritual about growing cannabis
Just the fact that our systems made to
[SPEAKER_02]: work with it that we have that
endocannabinoid system is just There's a
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship there that's been around for
a very long time and I feel like the
[SPEAKER_02]: energy that you bring into your grow room
has an effect on your plants to some
[SPEAKER_02]: degree and if it's just a little bit
because you can see people in their daily
[SPEAKER_02]: lives that are really stressed out and
they go in the grow room stressed out
[SPEAKER_02]: every day and Oh, man, it's not getting
any better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing worse and their plants are
looking like crap and then there's people
[SPEAKER_02]: that will not go in their grow room unless
they're feeling in the right kind of mood
[SPEAKER_02]: and are doing good and doing well in life
and Happy and you can see their grow rooms
[SPEAKER_02]: proliferating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've definitely been in both situations
myself I've been stressed out overworked
[SPEAKER_02]: got so much going on can't focus in my
grow room starts looking like crap and
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there's been other times where it's
like, okay, there's something wrong in the
[SPEAKER_02]: grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to fix it now beyond it get it done
with and Yeah, I do I have an avoidance or
[SPEAKER_01]: away she goes so if things do start to go
like, you know Like oh, I don't know like
[SPEAKER_01]: what's wrong when this plants got some
things on the leaf and then I will start
[SPEAKER_01]: to avoid You know my like problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah Exactly how I act with that It's
looking like crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't want to deal with it right
now So let me ask you really quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your How many seasons did you do
11?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you came in after Trevor Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was my my my role expanded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah in season 7 after Cory and Trevor
left But I was in it the show from season
[SPEAKER_01]: 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a small recurring role where I'd
sort of get fired from jobs every season
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay every season except season 6.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if memory serves And then I was
sort of there I guess laying in wait when
[SPEAKER_01]: they were Looking for like, you know
someone to fill the jail cover role So
[SPEAKER_02]: after all that time what was what was one
of your favorite moments filming Like in
[SPEAKER_01]: all of trailer park boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Gosh, I mean there's been you know
It's pretty there's been lots of fun times
[SPEAKER_01]: like for me It's it's always pretty
surreal being on set even at this point
[SPEAKER_01]: like it wasn't the early years just you
know Regular Joe, you know working in
[SPEAKER_01]: kitchens and being pulled out Going to
like work on trailer park boys or you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: be on TV every so often totally not used
to it and So it was you know, it's always
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of freaky and then like when my role
expanded and I was on the show a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to see how stuff worked and It
always remained.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah super kind of surreal and freaky like
yours just cruising around in the back of
[SPEAKER_01]: the shipmobile is that could be a pretty
good time like the smell of gasoline
[SPEAKER_01]: wafting, you know the The wind in your
hair old garbage from like seasons past
[SPEAKER_01]: still like hidden around and looks and
crannies But I mean, there's like yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's been so like all the crazy
shenanigans that we get up to you know in
[SPEAKER_01]: the episodes like Like fucking around with
the horse stuff was pretty fun Fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: around in the woods in season seven season
seven was such a big like change for me
[SPEAKER_01]: Like like from just being on set once or
twice a year at else, you know all of a
[SPEAKER_01]: sudden being on there for a whole season
like most days and being involved so much
[SPEAKER_01]: in this plot was a Yeah, like like pretty
mind-blowing, you know and and fun like
[SPEAKER_01]: all the stuff in the woods when like we
crashed the car into the woods and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: like lost in the woods laying their train
tracks and you know for the Swayze Express
[SPEAKER_01]: that was you know, pretty Just but I mean
there's so many times it's almost like The
[SPEAKER_01]: rule as opposed to the exception was like,
you know, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like like what what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was reading your reddit AMA earlier And
I saw where you were talking about the
[SPEAKER_02]: shipmobile and actually running having to
be dropped off by a flatbed truck Jump
[SPEAKER_01]: started every time By the by the end I
think they still have That same old one,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is like this actual second
shipmobile, but it was still yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: like wouldn't start couldn't like hold a
charge weak like gas Not not road licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's this dude in London,
Ontario who's got a replica of it I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know if you've ever come across that on a
replica.
[SPEAKER_01]: He built a replica.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a shout out to Mike raspberry fucking
like if you look up shipmobile,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember is his username but
Raspberry shipmobile go find him Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's got this beautiful replica of the
shipmobile and the boys have been filming
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff this summer again And they actually
got him to come out and use his car as the
[SPEAKER_01]: as the like the set car For the boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a proper running road worthy
version of the shipmobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: The door comes off and on as you know
Looking this up right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what was your least favorite moment I
Mean I find like moments when I feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't like Like nail the scene properly
like I didn't sort of act good could be
[SPEAKER_01]: like pretty nerve-wracking like You know
get I mean like sort of you know super
[SPEAKER_01]: self-conscious about it and I feel I yeah
couldn't like I guess to deliver the lines
[SPEAKER_01]: in a way that seemed realistic or you
know, whatever the case may be Does one
[SPEAKER_02]: scene stick out is a genuinely hard one
for you to do one thing that comes to mind
[SPEAKER_01]: was yeah I was supposed to be acting drunk
in a it was in the don't legalize it movie
[SPEAKER_01]: and I was supposed to go on a mission on
the road with the boys in in the movie but
[SPEAKER_01]: then like my dad Phil Collins grounded me
basically and told me I couldn't go so I
[SPEAKER_01]: had to go and tell the boys that I
couldn't go and I was you know nervous
[SPEAKER_01]: about it and super drunk and yeah acting
drunk like Trying to slur your words and
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, I guess be or we know
whatever like, you know be Woozy on your
[SPEAKER_01]: feet and that kind of thing was yeah super
hard to execute I don't think I did it at
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet if Jacob Collins or yeah Jacob
Collins comes so natural to you and then
[SPEAKER_02]: Being in a sober state of mind trying to
portray yourself in a drunken state of
[SPEAKER_02]: mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be pretty difficult Yeah,
I know I know John Dunsworth.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure He was yeah, he was
amazing and I think I I heard that he was
[SPEAKER_01]: not much of a drinker at all in real life
is that Yeah, that's uh, that's that's my
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding and yeah, he could turn on
and turn off like yeah, you know super
[SPEAKER_01]: super drunken State it seemed you on on
demand incredible If I had to ask you like
[SPEAKER_02]: your top three influences when it came to
acting Who would you shout out my top
[SPEAKER_01]: three influences?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Gosh, you know, I don't have Like my
approach to acting like I'm not like I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't really see myself as acting I'm just
sort of like, you know doing this stuff in
[SPEAKER_01]: front of the camera, but like I don't have
They sort of role models or that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing Or like actors who I sort of aspire
to be like How about art influencers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah for art that's a like I Robert crumb
would be one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked his stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I was growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad had some are crumb like stuff
around And like the psychedelic kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: Music posters of the you know,
60s and 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wow like like Peter Matthews Max he's
an artist who did like I think posters
[SPEAKER_01]: like in the more than 60s Maybe like Led
Zeppelin some sort of okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes bands like that, but like an early
source Really trippy screen prints nice
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff What's another don't remember his
name?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to look it up and send it to
you later But there was a guy that did a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of art for I don't know if you've
heard of them or not But the band yes back
[SPEAKER_02]: in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, that's totally Peter Max style
I don't know if Peter Max did like any yes
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, but they almost like could have
been like a similar very similar Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: the alien landscape Kind yeah,
but like any I like nice and colorful real
[SPEAKER_01]: trippy stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always love that We've been talking
about that art in our server Here for a
[SPEAKER_02]: while now just the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about heavy metal the old
Yeah movie, but they had put on the
[SPEAKER_02]: artwork that was in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Was there any times when you guys
were filming scene where it led to actual
[SPEAKER_01]: real trouble Gosh real trouble
[SPEAKER_01]: Once once the cops had to get called
because one of the background performers
[SPEAKER_01]: had some handcuffs That they didn't have a
key for they were they were real police
[SPEAKER_01]: handcuffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns out which are real I guess non
cops aren't allowed to have Civilians it
[SPEAKER_01]: it turns out but I guess they were in like
the props, you know, whatever like kit and
[SPEAKER_01]: This background guy wasn't supposed to be
handcuffing anybody but just like like the
[SPEAKER_01]: way the scene played out He you know,
he was with with Julian JP and I put the
[SPEAKER_01]: handcuffs on him and Then they couldn't
get him off, you know when that when the
[SPEAKER_01]: scene was done time to get ready for the
next take and so You know after a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: They had to call the cops to come in and
use the You know cop keys to get the the
[SPEAKER_01]: handcuffs Of course the cops were curious
as to you know, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Logging you up with some actual handcuffs
I think in the end the cops just like
[SPEAKER_01]: don't do that again But let them keep keep
the cuffs if I recall don't don't put me
[SPEAKER_01]: on that They were cool about it,
but they were just like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: come on guys We got the right cops were
you ever actually high on set Gosh that
[SPEAKER_01]: would be against Actra rules, so I don't
know if we have an amendment here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada, but Yeah, we can it's completely
up to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that saw it live is that you
answered it perfectly and you can edit
[SPEAKER_01]: that out No need to edit it but yeah,
no No comment, okay You'll be due to be on
[SPEAKER_01]: set late in the day have a smoke,
you know hours go by are you still a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: high?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows I'll tell you what I'm not the
one that's here to judge So how did they
[SPEAKER_02]: portray cannabis on scene?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it was There was plenty of times
where they had grows going or you guys had
[SPEAKER_01]: bags of weed Yeah, I was just thinking
about like how to how to describe it It
[SPEAKER_01]: was like sort of glorified but also,
you know that the dangers with the law
[SPEAKER_01]: were also certainly, you know made evident
on the show Yeah, I mean it was seen as
[SPEAKER_01]: something that was you know that I guess
Yeah, how was it portrayed like what
[SPEAKER_02]: what's your opinion on that was it like
what were they using to That you guys were
[SPEAKER_02]: walking around with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah Yeah, just like fake green stuff
basically like like other other herbs some
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of herbal mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would have bags of Four like when
we're smoking joints and just be some sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of like herbal mix, but it was disgusting
Like there's you know blends out there
[SPEAKER_01]: that are you know can be pleasant to smoke
like with you know this and that in it I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know anything about herbal mixes,
but I don't know if they're just going for
[SPEAKER_01]: a budget like using like a legal herb mix
Yeah a bunch of legal herbs and then when
[SPEAKER_01]: they had like like buds and like fake
weeds or plants they'd be these when like
[SPEAKER_01]: often when you saw it close they'd be real
sort of like getting to look in not very
[SPEAKER_01]: Realistic but at a distance or you know
for set decoration it would it would it
[SPEAKER_01]: would pass as weed plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess somewhere better than others
depending on like what resources they had
[SPEAKER_01]: and Yeah, I guess both Yeah, it was like
weird random like just like weird fake
[SPEAKER_01]: plant stuff or even like styrofoam Craner
kind of foam stuff that be spray painted
[SPEAKER_02]: to look like weed They portrayed it pretty
well when there was a time when Ricky
[SPEAKER_02]: Julian and bubbles were in a field of
marijuana that must have been real weed
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah I've also wondered so yeah,
I don't know if they knew people who had a
[SPEAKER_01]: grow operation or if it was maybe a hemp
some sort of If they had those here,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, like the scenes with Rita McNeil
It's like a real weed field to me We
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't got to touch much on your art yet
people some of these people don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're a very accomplished artist as
well When did you start doing art?
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh, I mean like back when I was a kid I
used to like to you know fuck around with
[SPEAKER_01]: that Crayons and stuff probably like most
most kids, but I always doodle like
[SPEAKER_01]: through school.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Like our class in high school Although I
didn't take it all the way through for
[SPEAKER_01]: what it's worth be like I would doodle it
in you know my notebooks in like high
[SPEAKER_01]: school and and university and Yeah,
like Turned it into started like screen
[SPEAKER_01]: printing a little bit here and there I
took a few courses after high school Like
[SPEAKER_01]: printmaking this and that but like just
sort of out of interest not planning to
[SPEAKER_01]: like sort of be an artist Or make a living
in art But then when I moved to
[SPEAKER_01]: Newfoundland in 2007 I like bought my
first house so I had space to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: studio there and set up a screen printing
studio and Started making posters for our
[SPEAKER_01]: friends band and that's how I sort of like
learned how to screen print and like learn
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the skills cut my chops so to
speak That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're taking it pretty seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got your own online shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can people find your art at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've got a website The URL is bam.ca
be triple am dot ca And yeah, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm like I'm a better I'm better
at production and sort of the business
[SPEAKER_01]: side of things but Yeah, I got my own
website which I which I've set up at the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning of the pandemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Etsy shop before that and Yeah,
yeah, so I do screen prints like which if
[SPEAKER_01]: you check it out, you'll see you'll see
the style of my drawing but kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: You know colorful trippy cartoon kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but there's a lot of Trailer Park
boys inspired art.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does a lot of his own original prints
you do t-shirts You can buy canvas prints
[SPEAKER_02]: What else did you have over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's uh, that's the most of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like so yeah, it's mainly screen
prints I make myself but there's also some
[SPEAKER_01]: some reproductions and some t-shirts and I
guess some stickers for example Next year
[SPEAKER_01]: to sort of like work on like diversifying
my selection a bit I'm working with some
[SPEAKER_01]: guys down in the states.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting some pipes made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh cool Which that would be awesome with
some original art on them And like the
[SPEAKER_01]: pipe itself being an original design as
well that that they're overseeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So That would be that would be really
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd get a BAM pipe for sure See all you
guys going off and chat there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be answering your questions
Towards the end of the episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still have about a half hour to go
Yeah, I've got chat off in earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got I can't focus on too many things,
but it's all good, man I just looked over
[SPEAKER_01]: there right now Just having a quick quick
peek.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've been off scene with trailer park
boys for a while Is there any upcoming
[SPEAKER_02]: projects for you acting or any more
trailer park boys?
[SPEAKER_01]: the yeah covid really slowed things down
for trailer park boys as it did for a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of a lot of shit, but uh Yeah,
they they made a third jail season just
[SPEAKER_01]: back in april of this year A few months
ago, and I was in for a few days on that
[SPEAKER_01]: and so yes, I was good to see the gang and
you know So yeah, like with the jail stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly the boys in jail and sort of
different main secondary cast But there
[SPEAKER_01]: are a few scenes with me and corey or me
and trinity Gina My tv wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so yeah, we're still there like alive
in the background Um, and there's plans
[SPEAKER_01]: for another season in the park next I
think next year is the current like time
[SPEAKER_01]: when it's like They're saying it's gonna
happen like all through cobalt.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kept saying like oh, yeah,
we're hoping to do it this year hoping to
[SPEAKER_01]: do it this year, so There is a plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I don't doubt but um, i'm not exactly
holding my breath Okay, but there is a
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a new jail season that I assume is
in the editing room these days We'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: you know coming out sometime this fall or
next spring So look forward to that guys
[SPEAKER_02]: and trailer park boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still stuck the same spot praying
praying you were always one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: characters, especially When you started
impersonating julian that should just
[SPEAKER_02]: crack me up the first time that they
pulled up on you And you're with uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: who was it the meat guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the meat dicks Yeah, I started
losing on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah the obsession What would have been
some of your favorite Extra scenes that
[SPEAKER_02]: you've done No, you've done multiple shows
that people might not even freaking know
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm with like I said Viggo Mortenson
earlier You did a bunch of extra zombie
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was some of your favorite extra work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the the zombie stuff would
definitely be the funnest And you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what dad what like the standard background
work Especially when I was getting like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know full makeup and like prosthetics
and stuff So, you know looking like super,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know super super zombie In I was in a
number of zombie movies I was I was living
[SPEAKER_01]: close to Toronto like in the early 2000s
when they were filming a bunch of zombie
[SPEAKER_01]: movies It was like a zombie right a sauce
So I happen to be the right place at the
[SPEAKER_01]: right time for a well and basically if you
wanted like it was such a grueling work
[SPEAKER_01]: working nights that a lot of people like
dropped out so Yeah, so like the work was
[SPEAKER_01]: there if you're willing to do it basically
and Yeah, so it was it was it was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also yeah, like like But by the end of
it, I was sick of it and sort of happy the
[SPEAKER_02]: movies would be ending Yeah, no more
zombie stuff for Jake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Being up all night never really was
my bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it like sort of really throws me
for a loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my Yeah, the lawnmower is real close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not coming through very bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent Okay, so This dank magician
who's deaf not a bot come on guys come on
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty sure it's thank magician says was
your favorite line from the show is Jacob
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite line I
[SPEAKER_01]: Mean they always keep my lines kind of
like kind of limited like knowing my
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing the limitations of my acting
ability like I never got giant giant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know chunks of You know lines to a to
memorize and read But yes, it's funny like
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm totally drawing a blank on that on
that question When what was there a
[SPEAKER_02]: particular scene that came to you and You
could just automatically do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had no trouble with it and you came
out of it going I fucking nailed that I
[SPEAKER_01]: Mean a lot of the scenes are pretty
casual.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sort of like hanging out and You
know, I don't like fucking around I guess
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I would really do well to watch
watch this series again to almost
[SPEAKER_01]: reacquaint myself with all the stuff that
happened I'm uh, I haven't seen the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: series in probably over ten years So it's
a while So you don't go back and rewatch
[SPEAKER_02]: much of your own work?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I often I find it like like I
Don't like watching my scenes necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: like often that's fine But if the ones
where I feel I was like that were you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, poorly executed like like I Can
cringe like like the rest of them?
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, no, no, I haven't seen it in
ages.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Did watch season that like season five a
couple of winters ago and Like no laugh my
[SPEAKER_01]: ass off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was great What brought you back
to season five?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just one I wasn't I think it was
one of The earlier ones I was least least
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with And so I just happened to
like You know hit play on Netflix on that
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, nothing in particular brought me
to it It's got to be surreal watching
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself on TV It is yeah, it's It's
strange What do you think like yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: register it necessarily like what do you
think young?
[SPEAKER_02]: Jacob Rolfe would have said if I would
have told him hey you're gonna Be pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: famous actor Yeah, he might have been a
he'd probably be like right on Famous is a
[SPEAKER_01]: special kind of yeah sort of micro micro
fame Although it's been great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've been this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it I've benefited from it obviously
like wonderfully Like yeah, like most of
[SPEAKER_01]: the art I was I was doing screen printing
for a while Alongside trailer park boys
[SPEAKER_01]: and just started doing trailer park boys
themed prints like maybe three four years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago It was maybe a year before kovat but
they're by far my like yeah best-selling
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff and so it's like Yeah, I'm like I'm
riding the trailer park boys waves,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though I'm happy to be adding like my
own, you know something I like your own
[SPEAKER_02]: thing that you got going on there the
trailer park boys art school.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny as hell I think more than
anything What I appreciate about art is
[SPEAKER_02]: the artist and having that trademark
Signature thing that they do, you know and
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of your prints Are heavy on the red
you do a lot of heavy reds on stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: that Makes it pop and it's kind of like an
alternative Comic I part I think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really cool how you do that and it's your
own thing We are going to be putting in an
[SPEAKER_02]: order at the BAM dot CA So a few of our
members here are gonna be winning some of
[SPEAKER_02]: that art look forward to that All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I give you guys a few minutes to ask a
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how you use it taco He says after
the last season of skinwalker ranch,
[SPEAKER_02]: what do you think's going on out there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yes, do you believe in aliens I
think that's what he's asking I definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: like think that there'd be other life in
the universe whether or not they're like
[SPEAKER_01]: contacting our planet, you know,
I guess I'm neutral about it Like I've got
[SPEAKER_01]: it open to the idea the news like like the
testimony before Congress in the states
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff I've heard it's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a few memes where they put Jacob
like into the Congress, you know testify
[SPEAKER_01]: and For example, and so I'm sort of
vaguely aware of that going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I'm not aware of like what
they've been saying but I'd yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely think that there'd be other
it would be like pretty presumptuous To
[SPEAKER_01]: think that there'd be no other life
anywhere in the universe that that seems
[SPEAKER_02]: ridiculous how I feel about it,
too Do says where in the fuck did the idea
[SPEAKER_02]: for Steve French come from Yeah,
for some reason I think it was from the
[SPEAKER_01]: mind of Mike Smith aka bubbles I mean,
I think the like Clattenburg and the boys
[SPEAKER_01]: would write sort of write together in the
early days Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a sip of tea here So yeah,
it could have been from the mind of Mike
[SPEAKER_01]: Clattenburg Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm amazed at
like all the good ideas that the guys come
[SPEAKER_01]: up with, you know, even like ideas like it
Giving a cougar her name like Steve French
[SPEAKER_02]: genius Yeah, that was that was ridiculous
besides your own character What was your
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite character on the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not actors but actual character I think
like ray the cat ray Ricky's dad Because I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean both because it's so well,
you know executed well acted but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's just such a I mean sort of like Ricky
there characters that Like you come across
[SPEAKER_01]: in your life, you know as you're going
around in the world but aren't represented
[SPEAKER_01]: much unlike You know, I like standard sort
of TV and movies If that makes any sense,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah free spirit But yeah, yeah just like
Relatable sort of like a real dude like
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of believable dude Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, very relatable to most people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh god, you're gonna make me do this or
him do this anonymous says Can you do the
[SPEAKER_02]: BAM for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do a BAM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo doc Yeah, we got a BAM I do feel like a
trained monkey sometimes But I also like
[SPEAKER_02]: bringing people a pleasure Stu says pinky
in the brain is pink Kush crossed with
[SPEAKER_01]: brain og That sounds very believable.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right Look that one up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some people that were growing in
the area about that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might know more about it So
throughout working on trailer park boys
[SPEAKER_02]: doing extras Even doing your art What do
you think some of the best things that
[SPEAKER_02]: you've learned from progressing your life
through that situation?
[SPEAKER_01]: What has it taught you oh Man I've been
reflecting like in recent, you know days
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks how I feel like I'm you know Sort of
learning the same lessons over and over
[SPEAKER_01]: again in in life So I don't know if I'm
learning anything really Sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes you gotta learn some things hard
I'm really trying to get a stage of my
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm 48 but and I've been doing
this for a while, but it's like hard I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean, it's easier said than done but sort
of simplifying things So like moving from
[SPEAKER_01]: the city to the country was a big,
you know step in that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just like you know less Less
distraction, I guess like like sure
[SPEAKER_01]: simplifying in a physical and in a mental
sense And so yeah, it's like I'm I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: Feeling pretty high all of a sudden here
as I try to describe this Oh, no,
[SPEAKER_02]: Jacob gongs of all fucking people is high
on our podcast about weed Like yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm I'm trying to like arrange my life So
like to like, you know not be in the rat
[SPEAKER_01]: race, but I mean that's like I mean I
guess who wouldn't like that in a way but
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I find it easy to fall into the
you know, sort of habit of working
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly I mean often like you're doing
that just to get by you know I've been in
[SPEAKER_01]: that situation a lot including in recent
years but then like yeah trying to figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out a balance between yeah, like work and
Life where you're not like working too
[SPEAKER_01]: much I mean I do take like I travel in the
winter and take a lot of time like I
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't be working full-time when I'm
traveling in the winter So when it's
[SPEAKER_01]: averaged across the year Maybe I'm like
doing pretty well, but I still feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working too much by my standards It's
it's a constant balance that's part of
[SPEAKER_01]: life is trying to find that balance fine
that yeah As an artist or as an artist as
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know as a stone rise as a human
like And sort of being in charge of myself
[SPEAKER_01]: I find pretty challenging to like,
you know manage my time in a way that's
[SPEAKER_01]: effective often, you know, like So that's
that's a constant fucking struggle for me
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Don't think it really stops until you
got somebody wiping your butt for you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I Think that's just one of those
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're always chasing whether it's yeah
whether that's because you're older
[SPEAKER_02]: because you're just rich enough to
Hopefully the latter John you're taking my
[SPEAKER_02]: question here, man Says favorite cut of
cannabis on an island pick one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually ask on my Meet the breeder
episodes where we interview cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders, but we'll see if you got one
What does that mean exactly?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you if I will be?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you went on to a desert island,
I told you Jake you can only take one type
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabis with you and Nothing else the
rest of your life What type of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: would you bring?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I guess well, I mean I find me some of
that pinky in the brain a pinky in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Brain, what was it about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was so outstanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it the flavor the high?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was I guess like it was the high I
Guess it was like a right balance like
[SPEAKER_01]: body and head in a certain way that was
both like Strong but not too strong where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really would knock me out But I was
so like I guess maybe I had like some
[SPEAKER_01]: euphoric elements to it that That I liked
and it didn't seem to like peter out Over
[SPEAKER_01]: time at least for the time that I had the
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I had like a giant pile of
it or anything, but Wasn't a quick high it
[SPEAKER_01]: stuck around for a while It was and it was
like a really full kind of high is what I
[SPEAKER_01]: like how I want to describe it Like I had
depth to it In the way that you is that oh
[SPEAKER_02]: man So out of all your time doing trailer
park boys And everything do you have any
[SPEAKER_02]: regrets?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean like something not like to do
with the show I Mean I think I got
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes I wonder if I could have like
parlayed I mean I I can still like look
[SPEAKER_01]: for other acting jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something that I actively do at
all, but like I may have You know missed
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities to like get parlay my
trailer park boys like you know sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: minor fame into other like jobs,
I guess Like acting or or otherwise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely not really like a like much
of a hustler type But still you know like
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes You know my lack of sort of get
up and go It's one of the things you know
[SPEAKER_01]: Reflect on from time to time But yeah
calling it a regret might be a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try and not to think of it that way I
guess yeah Oh Yes, thank you taco um So we
[SPEAKER_02]: were talking about rolling joints and
taking dabs earlier You said you weren't
[SPEAKER_02]: much of a concentrates guy unless it came
to like a vaporizer pen What is your
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite method of consumption?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I like to smoke joints And Maybe
it's because it's a product of growing up
[SPEAKER_01]: in Ottawa, so I got I got a little
sprinkle of tobacco with my flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I know a lot of people will like you
know fuck at but Yeah, that's my I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: dead That's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh doesn't need to be much like just you
know 5% 10% not like the British style
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's like 80% or You know the vast
majority of it is tobacco those I find
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to smoke, but yeah, yeah It's just
stronger than necessary by and large
[SPEAKER_01]: although.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly enjoys like hash Yeah,
you buy like pre-rolled cones if you roll
[SPEAKER_01]: them yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Just roll joints with like regular size
papers normally like some little OCB that
[SPEAKER_02]: your preferred paper is it just any paper?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just just what I they were I bought
these on on Amazon They were like you know
[SPEAKER_01]: decent price on them, but I just like any
any thin paper will do basically And I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't like to spend like three bucks on my
papers, so Yeah All right, man well before
[SPEAKER_02]: we get going here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh taco says what's your favorite type of
edible?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoo You know I think I haven't done
edibles in the in the in the last week or
[SPEAKER_01]: so I think I might have some tonight,
but Maybe just a nice glob of rick simpson
[SPEAKER_01]: oil You know like a maybe a double rice
grain like right out of the syringe onto
[SPEAKER_01]: my thumbnail and then Nice yeah,
that's a good utilitarian simple way to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I certainly enjoy like a I had a
delicious Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a peanut butter Cup or something
that like this fancy bakery it made it was
[SPEAKER_01]: apparently an edible although.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so delicious I Didn't taste any
Cannabis like there was there was noted
[SPEAKER_01]: this there was no discernible cannabis
flavor in it Not that that couldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: Also be delicious If it depends it depends
it can be overpowering or in some things
[SPEAKER_01]: that it doesn't necessarily blend with the
flavor in a way That's like yummy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but these tastes like straight-up like
baked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know baked goods that was I was
impressed I was wondering like this really
[SPEAKER_02]: be this is really an edible There's
definitely different quality variants of
[SPEAKER_02]: most edibles Even with the way you were
calling the weed oil the Rick Simpson oil
[SPEAKER_02]: or RSO I've had some of that that just
makes me choke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just nasty It's really really bad,
and then I've had other ones where it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like oh my god.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate every flavor of this cannabis
You know it just it tastes like cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, not like where some others are dark
and alkali and I Generally try to like
[SPEAKER_01]: just swallow it not get it like into my
mouth be like when you do get it in your
[SPEAKER_01]: mouth I get there's a lot of flavor in
there like if it's all you know if The
[SPEAKER_01]: tacky oils like spreading around your
mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it can be either like Yeah,
kind of pleasant and interesting or you
[SPEAKER_01]: have like overwhelming and like Yeah,
not good basically Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's a lot of factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess to go There can be a play there
I've seen like rickson smile this like all
[SPEAKER_01]: right, so that's really chunky and like
suspicious looking like maybe not filtered
[SPEAKER_01]: properly or I Guess I do get chunks
sometimes in the bottom of cook too long
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets really thick maybe But but like
normally it's pretty consistent oil I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess maybe on the second run you get more
like maybe some waxes coming out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant when you're If it's been sitting in
the alcohol longer It's been a long time
[SPEAKER_02]: since I've made Rick Simpson oil myself
But maybe somebody can speak on it and
[SPEAKER_02]: chat before we get going here And taco
says can he make a print of you like the
[SPEAKER_02]: lady from Titanic?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I'm comfortable posting
posing like that taco Off the prow of the
[SPEAKER_02]: ship like yeah, okay, I could do that one
I'll be comfortable with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was I was thinking the French girls
scene and like Naked lying in the like
[SPEAKER_01]: lying in a on a couch kind of thing like
yeah, I guess that's what he's going there
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go head over to BAM dot C a
That's three A's in there guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take it right here To get you guys
some prints from Jacob Collins of trailer
[SPEAKER_02]: park boys Jacob.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for giving us your time
talking to us about your life your
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis experience throughout it and how
it plays into you I've seen you go around
[SPEAKER_02]: at a lot of dispensaries that are local to
you and shout them out would it be fair to
[SPEAKER_02]: say that you are a Cannabis advocate and
they you advocate for the plant I do yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like sort of passive about it,
but yeah for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a I'm an advocate of for cannabis How
do you view it is it something that works
[SPEAKER_02]: for you medicinally I would think so
taking RSO Yeah, or is it more of a
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I Guess like a little from you know
joint a little from joint B I Do I mean I
[SPEAKER_01]: I've come to think of my you know smoking
weed as you know some version of
[SPEAKER_01]: self-medicating like you know sort of in
retrospect from when I started smoking it
[SPEAKER_01]: to the present Although I also like
smoking it for fun Yeah I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it always was for me as a kid
going into it It was definitely a
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know want to get high with my friends
And as I got older I started getting back
[SPEAKER_02]: Pain neck pain things like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really started focus on this is helping
with that Which strains which types can I
[SPEAKER_02]: find that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Balance me out in those areas the most
which one takes away my neck pain the most
[SPEAKER_02]: which one helps me with my back pain the
most And then also a side effect of that
[SPEAKER_02]: is you get high so it's it's for both for
sure yeah, I mean I also find that like
[SPEAKER_01]: like with eating it like if you get like a
small dose of Oil, or you know whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: your your your method of preference is
Like doing a low-grade dose during the day
[SPEAKER_01]: is a nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know way to like Like it's not the
same heady high or noticeable sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: buzz, but yeah, it's sort of a mild uplift
which you know is a Which is real good
[SPEAKER_02]: Second joint and look what it's done to me
anyway Says where can I get that sure I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that is up at his online store,
too.

away.

hustle and bustle of cities it's nice to
[SPEAKER_01]: have access sort of to it like for when
you want some of that action or You know

[SPEAKER_01]: woods kind of lifestyle But you know where
you can walk to a village or something
