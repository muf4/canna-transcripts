[SPEAKER_01]: we got Matthew from solo farms online.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing Maddie?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you good good?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to hear your voice nice to get
to finally talk to you For all my
[SPEAKER_01]: followers that have no idea who solo farms
is why don't you give them a quick?
[SPEAKER_01]: Introduction to who you are and what you
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, just Matthew from solo farms I live
in Maine I grow cannabis As a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, I also breed genetics for
cannabis It's been a huge passion of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's far back as I can remember and that's
why I Still do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy it then and we got to do like
small batch stuff unique hash makers and
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely beautiful flower with older
things things that are unique to just me
[SPEAKER_00]: or my area of the country and Put a
different swing with some familiar things
[SPEAKER_00]: that people know from all over the country
Try to put my own little twist on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, when were those beginning phases?
[SPEAKER_01]: When did you get into growing cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing first time growing I want to
say that was It was outside and I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: say that was 1992 Just me and a buddy had
some seeds we found in bags, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that's what you had seeds back in
the day and I was like man I'd really like
[SPEAKER_00]: to see if we could grow our own and During
those years in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always a drought So we're like,
well, I'll take some of these seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: start growing our own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we could supplement At the end of
the year, you know, yeah just kids Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: just young guys just playing around and
seeing what we could do and I guess that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of sparked it man because we ended
up, you know actually doing okay and First
[SPEAKER_00]: time doing it like oh wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so cool, you know And we just back
then all you would see it is coming in a
[SPEAKER_00]: bag or a brick and then to actually see
the plant Looking like something we used
[SPEAKER_00]: to see it and high times man
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well we're some of those first cultivars
that you fell in love with Oh God some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the first ones I want to say like playing
around with as far as like like back then
[SPEAKER_00]: it was like Mexican indicators sativas,
you know land racy stuff and then we had
[SPEAKER_00]: some buddies that up north and northern
New England that we're doing it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit longer like their dads were there
their family were like my own and we ended
[SPEAKER_00]: up getting a couple cuts and stuff and You
know through black market getting seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: from different various ways Just unique
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say rock bud was one of them From
Soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, New York City diesel and just so many
god bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean an adult Vita Was that Soma's NYC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was a good one New York City
diesel Which I did earlier work with
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately we never I took it to like
F2 and Because of that chem family it just
[SPEAKER_00]: always seemed to carry Some hermaphroditic
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just kind of left it alone You would
find some really nice things But if you
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't adamant enough or if you went away
for the day And came back and something
[SPEAKER_00]: happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just you know, it's just something that
we didn't want to and back then I just
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't know enough to really Say hey
stress test these things in different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways, you know and all the time reading
about it obviously friends like Chris
[SPEAKER_00]: helping in so many different ways Just
drop in these little knowledge bombs every
[SPEAKER_00]: once in a while on me during conversations
Helped improve that and then asking
[SPEAKER_00]: questions and then just going for it too,
man Yeah breeding cannabis is definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: for looking for certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's So much different than just like
growing cannabis only for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely so many different components to
it and you know, hopefully I think a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people when they get it if they crying
into it or even just like a novice just
[SPEAKER_00]: Home grower say man.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two things are really nice and to be
honest with you everybody out there that
[SPEAKER_00]: was that is a breeder or upcoming breeder
We were all in that same spot at one point
[SPEAKER_00]: and just saying man, these are really nice
and You know, I think back then too.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people were nervous about
Ordering seeds online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah years ago So I think certain people
were just making their own having
[SPEAKER_00]: something that stood out in their area and
said hey we did this You know and over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years obviously it just has gotten so much
more intricate when I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look for depending on what I'm using and
what the I guess the end result of least
[SPEAKER_00]: of that particular project is As far as
like a goal like an end goal Stability of
[SPEAKER_00]: male.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that male and lineage bring to
the table?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just because of the strain that I
like Has a lot of different components
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal value Everything like that man
Is it a short growing plant that I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to put it with and pair it with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: The cool thing about breeding is I find
it's much like art Like every breeders got
[SPEAKER_01]: their own little flair their own little
fling that they kind of throw on things
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what attracts us to
these certain people I'm still kind of in
[SPEAKER_01]: those beginning stages still learning
about breeding and one of the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've Definitely picked up is that when
you've got a project in mind you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: have your goals, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have to have those boxes that
it meets those expectations and anything
[SPEAKER_01]: that doesn't Automatically make those
expectations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gone, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can't waste a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to put any more energy and
time into it Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to ask you For you,
what's your artistic touch?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are those boxes that you know,
every project's gonna have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything that you find that box
is consistently going through?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of your cultivar cultivars everything
that you're producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going for turps?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going for?
[SPEAKER_00]: resin return Just so always resin return
and turps Pretty much the the most
[SPEAKER_00]: important part the medicinal part of that
play Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love an amazing flower looking at
amazing boutique or artisanal style flower
[SPEAKER_00]: especially nowadays in this new market
with so many stores and people It's so
[SPEAKER_00]: much easier for them to go in and look at
something pretty Versus, you know catches
[SPEAKER_00]: their eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah the biggest thing for me with Let's
just say the skittles blissful wizard
[SPEAKER_00]: product project that I did That mail just
added figure stack That mail just stacks
[SPEAKER_00]: really well super resilient to pests
lighting heat stresses cold stresses food
[SPEAKER_00]: stresses like Over watering under watering
all those different things just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: chugs right through not super picky but
the biggest Thing about him was adding
[SPEAKER_00]: resin Just really packing in resin in all
those little areas where certain strains
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the head size or the Just what
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks beautiful, but you know,
there's certain ones that just really back
[SPEAKER_00]: in right That's really my biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm growing for hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want and hash I love tasty
beautiful good producing hash That people
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to enjoy and that growers want
to grow because they can actually get a
[SPEAKER_00]: yield That was really some of them and
just because I paired them with certain
[SPEAKER_00]: ones even though I With all testing and
then growing these all out and then doing
[SPEAKER_00]: washes on everything Doesn't mean that
that my bail even though I put it to it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna always link up Right, you know,
it's not a guarantee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my intention had some what to do
with it and then just man it was a you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, just putting in the time and Really
watching and and then also picking
[SPEAKER_00]: specific females that just had Excellent
properties already and it's just like I
[SPEAKER_00]: said, I'll say it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't guarantee you anything,
but it's definitely a good thing
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't downplay it too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew that mountain wizard from you and
Every single one of those females was a
[SPEAKER_00]: resin hog Even at the end of the day that
you could get the best of each combined
[SPEAKER_00]: them and sometimes it just does not work
right like Chris has told me so many times
[SPEAKER_00]: like man we have all the right intentions
and This is what I remember from this one
[SPEAKER_00]: and then when you pair it up and sometimes
they just don't think well, yeah and by
[SPEAKER_00]: the grace of God and a little bit of luck
and With some foresight I guess and a
[SPEAKER_00]: little help man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just worked So and the positive
feedback and I guess you know what another
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that maybe helped you is before even
Releasing these projects and showing
[SPEAKER_00]: people on the solo farms page like hey,
this was the great fire This is this this
[SPEAKER_00]: is this in showing them and then working
with those products and then having
[SPEAKER_00]: availability to them, you know to keep
people and Getting it out there so people
[SPEAKER_00]: can actually try it and then know and then
I think Coming out with a product that I
[SPEAKER_00]: made myself with some of these ones that
they were already enjoying Just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: paired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, man, it just worked out rather It
just really did I think about it a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: this like wow, you know at least with that
particular one because I did enough work
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, it doesn't guarantee you
anything now if I was talking about Maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: the grapefruit work epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been so many years of that since
2010 I mean I got me and a buddy got the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in 2005 for those out at the
Amsterdam High Times Cup and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: around 2009 10 is when we started playing
around with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did them inside outside found some
really nice things Found a nice now did
[SPEAKER_00]: some preservation where we could keep more
of the genetics and go to go through For
[SPEAKER_00]: further work just because it did so
amazing up here outside It just seemed
[SPEAKER_00]: like man this thing's so Strong she's
super healthy super vigorous Man,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's try to I think this would work
really well with some other stuff that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have, you know at the current time and So
we you know I think we brought it up to
[SPEAKER_00]: 2015 we had about five years of work with
it Every year we did some populations of
[SPEAKER_00]: them varied amounts finally came and
narrowed down to f2s in Okay, I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: say we finished that up in the fall of
2014 and then Chris had come out in 2015
[SPEAKER_00]: for a MMCM show and you know, we were
doing the seed booth, so he came out for
[SPEAKER_00]: the weekend and Just funny story.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, yeah, I brought this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try this and it was Charlotte's web
and one of his buddies That was actually
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a cut of this grapefruit from Steve
And it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was like, hey instead of me running
mine separately Why don't we just put ours
[SPEAKER_00]: both together?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'd be super tasty and really
medicinal from the shop It's wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was like, yeah sure cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Friday night we get out of the show We
smoke some and we're smoking it all night
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Saturday comes around and there was a
bunch of us in the hotel room Just hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: out and with with smoke and then I'm like,
man, this would be just kind of crazy Cuz
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like you have the shallots Yeah,
the shallots web and he's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a cow iffy You know as far as bro
wise obviously not medicinal wise so he
[SPEAKER_00]: was you know, giving me some backstory on
her and how it was for him and He was like
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I you know, I'd almost think about getting
that cut and maybe Doing something with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well shit Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got grapefruit f2s that we have and I'd
love to put some in your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do like let's do some collab work
and maybe Hopefully end up finding
[SPEAKER_00]: something and then read like let's make
this train.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super Delicious and it made us feel
good all weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys knocked it out of the park on
that one I'm really glad you brought that
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the things that is my like
paintbrush to the canvas for me is a
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple really good friends with knowledge
Me obviously having some heirs to listen,
[SPEAKER_00]: but my I've been and I don't know where I
got it from I just have it Some people got
[SPEAKER_00]: it and I for cannabis man to watch how
these girls grow and I guess I I guess it
[SPEAKER_00]: can't kind of came out of Necessity
because in the bill in the beginning when
[SPEAKER_00]: I first started doing this Having like,
you know smaller children To being super
[SPEAKER_00]: just three limited spacing Yeah,
really paying attention to what I needed
[SPEAKER_00]: and what I could use So I guess that kind
of you know narrows down those Easter Eggs
[SPEAKER_01]: quick when you got to get shit out because
you need room, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, and it just I think it they insert
and senses more than others because at
[SPEAKER_00]: least that's how I feel and I think that's
a Probably why some of it and then just I
[SPEAKER_00]: love this plant man This plant is just no
matter what from a young age always helped
[SPEAKER_00]: me and So many other people around me and
I'm like man and obviously, you know as
[SPEAKER_00]: young kids I Like mid 80s and through the
90s looking at high times and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing all this and these guys like wow
They're so underground and this is so
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're getting brick Weed back here,
but these guys are on Cali crushing it and
[SPEAKER_00]: just seeing all those different all the
different expressions of this this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm like man I I really love one day
to be able to say I've found some unique
[SPEAKER_00]: things and then things that are familiar
to people and I can maybe hopefully make
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that for not only myself,
but maybe to share and then in sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it all started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like making some beans super early
projects knowing what I'm looking for But
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe not having a super end goal just
open expressions, but knowing what's there
[SPEAKER_00]: is really good Passing out a lot of free
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's almost like paying your dues when
you're getting into reading, right Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just like putting him into people that
I would kind of I looked up to and then
[SPEAKER_00]: other people in my same position or people
that Maybe you're just starting out and
[SPEAKER_00]: saying yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's tight there in springtime
You're gonna spend money on this and this
[SPEAKER_00]: this this and this here's some seeds go
try some of these They've done really well
[SPEAKER_00]: for me Hopefully, you know, we're in the
same climate and area But see if you like
[SPEAKER_00]: them to just add them, you know,
just a few of something different And I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know just with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of worked out really well,
you know Yeah, just kind of fell into
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess little bits at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely takes time I've been
extremely happy with everything that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: grown from you and I don't want to quite
get off I could praise you forever on the
[SPEAKER_01]: mountain wizard and we were we're
definitely gonna get into some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other stuff that you're working with but I
want to get back to that grapefruit really
[SPEAKER_01]: quick you and P had completely different
Cuts of the grapefruit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What made what happened there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well Chris ended up taking Finding an
amazing male out of the F2 stock that I
[SPEAKER_00]: gave them because at the time I was
building my new building and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: and I said Chris I got to kind of take a
backdrop to this but if you want to you
[SPEAKER_00]: have an amazing eye and if I was gonna
trust anyone with these I would you know
[SPEAKER_00]: my brother, yeah, and And Chris has that I
plus so I knew that I was more than
[SPEAKER_00]: confident that Chris would take it to the
next level really and definitely do it
[SPEAKER_00]: justice but keep in mind of where I was
going to and keeping it open a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think in the beginning Chris He kept
it open and then you know seeing some
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool things that he had in his
stable like that Durbin some of the older
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and You know with coming out with
that new relic line It just seemed to pale
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just the right time everything just
kind of in it and now you're at f4,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: F4 is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually Went back in on f2s okay
doing a large population and f4s and going
[SPEAKER_00]: back through now Hopefully, we'll see how
things are by fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be able to start getting the f5s
into testing is the goal Whether that
[SPEAKER_00]: completely works out is all on what we're
finding now From those f2s to this f4 that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're at now What's changed in the in the
phenotypes in the or I should say
[SPEAKER_01]: genotypes?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's changed in the genotypes are we
seeing more?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the sweet pink grapefruit are we
seeing more of both the sweet pink and the
[SPEAKER_01]: inbred lion type of stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like when Chris was doing his he had a
certain flavor that he was looking for and
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a really nice sweet pinky
grapefruit and he knew that's what I
[SPEAKER_00]: really like like With like a little bit of
funk in it and I think Chris was looking
[SPEAKER_00]: more of that sour like yeah funky
grapefruit like more gassy and So that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where he wanted to take his part of the
work to thus the relic grapefruit using a
[SPEAKER_00]: that same cut that Was in the oil that
sparked the whole thing up went back to
[SPEAKER_00]: that mutual buddy and ended up doing some
work with that cut which is Brita Steve's
[SPEAKER_00]: cut of the grapefruit and I mean it all
comes from that same lineage even my seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just I used stuff that I found in
what we Enjoyed right when it came time to
[SPEAKER_00]: do the f4s I've only released the a
version so I have a through D on the f4s
[SPEAKER_00]: and I Basically did it so I wanted to keep
my expressions open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to bottleneck it into just
one thing Because I want to get these out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and see what no no I know what I
like But people that are grabbing my gear
[SPEAKER_00]: They might want that open expression
because they've seen it my version of it
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris's version of it and then obviously
multiple hybrids so what when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: pairing females with that male and they're
taking a sweet pink grapefruit that was
[SPEAKER_00]: like short and stocky more Indica growth
and then a more sativa more faster
[SPEAKER_00]: vigorous female on the sweet side and Use
those two and then the other end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum that more gaspy New York City
like easily red grapefruit look like a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more sour with the same stretch a
short Indica stach with like a more
[SPEAKER_00]: stacked it's your nodal spacing and then
something with a little bit more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch and a little bit different of a
spacing so I could keep Everything open
[SPEAKER_00]: because as far as further project,
you know at that time I'm like I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to just make this one thing like This
is how I'm gonna really find it when I
[SPEAKER_00]: find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna know Yeah, I think that was a
good approach to because they all like
[SPEAKER_01]: they were all great in their own,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for certain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I you know, and I just I Feel
like if I don't do if I didn't do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I'd be kind of limiting myself And
then other people to know absolutely and I
[SPEAKER_00]: want like I want everyone to enjoy the way
You know that these things caught my eye I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean and it's so funny the way trending
like the way cannabis trends in the
[SPEAKER_00]: markets go like we've had these for so
long and it's smoking on it, but then
[SPEAKER_00]: everything went through with Cookies and
then all the other different hybrids and
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate every strain They're there
for what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm never gonna bash on one style of
breeding and or Kind of candidates like
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all they all have their purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree I think the grapefruit and me
starting to open up into breeding and I
[SPEAKER_00]: just felt like I should definitely keep
that going and keep it open because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of unique to me and this other guy
and He says I think he ended up selling
[SPEAKER_00]: all his share of his seeds from that
season and I wanted them for preservation
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew what I wanted to do it and it was
just like I don't ever want this girl to
[SPEAKER_00]: go away Because I mean how many strains
have been lost because if not,
[SPEAKER_01]: we know without hindsight Yeah,
and that's one that's got to stick around
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta say that's probably still to this
day one of my favorite smokes of all time
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I mean she's been around for a
long Time and I think people kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, this is so good, but then you know
some new things coming Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so good, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's natural instinct Everyone's gonna I
mean variety is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the spice of life But I also like
something I can go back to that's
[SPEAKER_00]: reminiscing Yes, and it's just a flavor
can take you back to a memory in a good
[SPEAKER_00]: time, you know So it wasn't just about the
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about those memories It was a
collective thing I feel and I think I
[SPEAKER_00]: would have been doing an injustice of not
keeping it around So that's why when I
[SPEAKER_00]: chose someone if I was anybody was gonna
work with it with me would would be Chris
[SPEAKER_00]: like that's my brother I love him and You
know, he loves that plant and I loved
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris and have the utmost admiration
Because for him because he he stays in his
[SPEAKER_00]: own like he made his own way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely everything that he has Is
so unique to him and he doesn't sway and
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's worked with some stuff that's
familiar with other people too Because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's smart and to be honest with you those
cherry vanilla cookies and all this cookie
[SPEAKER_00]: strings that platinum cookies is fire Oh
fire's fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so different than a lot of the other
cookie hybrids and are out there so still
[SPEAKER_00]: even then even doing cookie strings like
you know learning Chris on those notes
[SPEAKER_00]: like he's So individual and through
inconsistent Super consistent taking so
[SPEAKER_00]: many pages out of his book and just dinner
after dinner and event after event with
[SPEAKER_00]: him and just even just phone calls just
taking all of that info and and just
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting that vibe to you know,
just you could talk forever So easygoing
[SPEAKER_00]: so humble so open with information,
too But he's not scared to share where is
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know in the early years no one
wanted to tell anybody anything Are you
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna learn that so and I think we've all
gone through that if you're within a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain age I mean if you're 40 a young
you've definitely felt that oh Yeah for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to have somebody around like him
that's you know willing to willing to help
[SPEAKER_01]: out and he's always been One of those
people that he's over the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was one of the first people though the
first time I met Him he put my kids before
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted to make sure that they had
juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had drinks They were ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were happy before we even started
talking and it's like goddamn that's I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean it shows the character quality,
you know Oh, he's he's a genuine dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I love him, man He's such a
good guy So I've taken so many things with
[SPEAKER_00]: when I think of those kind of
relationships and then working with my own
[SPEAKER_00]: personal stuff I keep all those things in
mind and it's like I can't let these guys
[SPEAKER_00]: down because They've never let me down and
I would be like kind of doing a just
[SPEAKER_00]: justice if I did I think like that's how I
feel like I can't do that like And he was
[SPEAKER_00]: super supportive even before I even
decided doing everything After the
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborative work, you know, I talked to
him and I said hey Chris I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, man I said now that I've done
what I've had to do with the building and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the caregiving stuff is well on its
way and all that stuff's kind of whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm really thinking going back
in on the true passion and Really doing
[SPEAKER_00]: some work with this breeding and I just
want you to know that I'm gonna definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: start going back in on these grapefruits
and but I want to ask you and say
[SPEAKER_00]: something to you because I know that we've
done some collaborative work and you've
[SPEAKER_00]: already released some things and He was so
good about he's like, are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why you do whatever you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you gave me these like And that's
just the person he is but me being the
[SPEAKER_00]: person I am I have to be transparent I'm
gonna ask and if he felt away like said,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe we'll just keep working on them
Maybe we do some more collaborative work
[SPEAKER_00]: with it or maybe I had a different vert
You know vision for it and no that was not
[SPEAKER_00]: the case Not at all Which made me even
want to push even harder with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you did man and just so happy
again I'm really grateful that I'm getting
[SPEAKER_00]: so much amazing feedback from everyone
brother like and everyone's really
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoying them and being supportive and For
the most part like anyone that follows us
[SPEAKER_00]: like really just is like, hey,
these are just amazing Like wow is
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone's like the buzz is going around
and the photos are coming out People are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually getting to enjoy some of the
extracts and the flower at their local You
[SPEAKER_00]: know stores or person and then obviously
their own personal experiences either
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in their garden inside or outside
It's kind of just built itself and now
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's going it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know man I still I'm like,
yeah, we just had this and we were
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoying it No one really knew about like
we all knew it was like through cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: enthusiasts and That grapefruit was around
but to have like a strain and then work on
[SPEAKER_00]: it locally And then just like people
locally like, you know, it's okay like and
[SPEAKER_00]: then some people really enjoying it But we
really just loved it and it wasn't just
[SPEAKER_00]: and to be honest with you the f2s super
terpy huge blobs a shortens the time on
[SPEAKER_00]: anything adds bigger like a You can't
believe You shorten the time on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I shortened the time like anything
that that grapefruit touches shortens the
[SPEAKER_01]: time They were already short when I grew
Yeah, which ones did you have a guide the
[SPEAKER_01]: I've the relic grapefruit the relic
grapefruit the inbred line was a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit longer But the sweet pink I mean that
that's stuck out like a sore thumb,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know That thing was just stacked up
bushy fucking yielded like a mother So I
[SPEAKER_00]: think when Chris was doing that relic I
think because Chris loves sativa Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's his true passion and to be honest
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love sativa I'm the same and I think
that gaseous one of what I've seen out of
[SPEAKER_00]: populations the gaseous more acrid sour
citrus Finos are a little more stretch
[SPEAKER_00]: here with a little more spacing a little
more Still having nice stacks though
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful stack flowers, but definitely
more stretching and I think that has to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with just that particular Version of the
plant that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what he likes So I believe when he
bred it, you know certain characteristics
[SPEAKER_00]: just remain more dominant Yes,
like I've done some like my buddies of
[SPEAKER_00]: that even out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of God, what is it that
the hell's the name of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was a Kimbo Kush Okay,
and this Kimbo Kush no matter what it
[SPEAKER_00]: touched just was so that Kimbo Kush male
was so dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you would 95% of the time until
you was getting this Kimbo Bush Whereas on
[SPEAKER_00]: these grapefruits You're gonna pretty much
see I mean you'll even you can get some
[SPEAKER_00]: different turf but pretty much for the
most part that is citrus It is sweet pink
[SPEAKER_00]: grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh for sure orange peel and then that sour
me a little more gassy like that so I
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely found exactly what you were
saying Michael Inbred line phenos,
[SPEAKER_01]: they had huge inner nodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking like two three inches,
but they have these rock hard buds on them
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here's a funny story for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd already been growing for quite a few
years by this point I already knew how to
[SPEAKER_01]: take clones and everything but that was
the one that really told me take a clone
[SPEAKER_01]: of everything because The sweet pink was
an obvious like I'm taking a I'm taking a
[SPEAKER_01]: cut of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna test it out We're gonna try it
out some more and you know, see how
[SPEAKER_01]: different environment the inbred line I
wasn't as interested in because those long
[SPEAKER_01]: inner nodes and it's like, oh god This is
just a mess of a plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it smelled so fucking beautiful I was
interested in it wasn't until after I cut
[SPEAKER_01]: it down that I was like, oh my god this
it's it's that Citrus sour that and not
[SPEAKER_01]: just citrus sour not like a lemon sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that grapefruit fucking Beautiful
sour, you know that so I guess that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: other thing so like when I say hash and
turkey And I kind of get this from like me
[SPEAKER_00]: and Chris share this I'm a terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love just the smell things I love to
taste the different things and just like
[SPEAKER_00]: with unique meals and You know,
they pair well with a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients that just sometimes you look
at I mean, you're like There's no way
[SPEAKER_00]: that's gonna change but when you layer
those flavors they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah So I guess my point where I'm
going with this is like on that mountain
[SPEAKER_00]: wizard just to say one My hope with the
skittles and then that mountain crop was
[SPEAKER_00]: just getting layered flavors Like you're
tasting one thing on the way out and when
[SPEAKER_00]: you on the way in and then when you blow
out It's like fuck Dude, that's so
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's two different sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah going like Bob Ross on his
painting and saying Accidents well,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's that happy little accident I guess
that was a damn good accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: I You know, and I said all I gotta say
then is it was amazing genetics I paired
[SPEAKER_00]: them and just worked out dude and with
Definitely with some effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna say that it wasn't but who
knew that that layering that was my wish
[SPEAKER_00]: and what I was going for as far as therapy
profile and it just hit it on the head And
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just one of those like yeah,
you know, you take your fist and you bring
[SPEAKER_00]: your elbow down like yeah I did it like It
was you know, and I'm usually not that
[SPEAKER_00]: guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like super like I'm just not but man
that was like, yes That definitely worked
[SPEAKER_00]: out my buddy just pulled some down so we
you know, we rolled one off obviously and
[SPEAKER_00]: He took the first couple hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like sweet candy orange
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, one of my favorite ones that I
found out that man wizard came out it had
[SPEAKER_01]: such an interesting profile a lot of them
were heavy heavy in that orange But I got
[SPEAKER_01]: one that had like a floral Soapy fresh
mintiness to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing and that one that one Fucks
you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So see there's where those That's the
other thing that's super nice about
[SPEAKER_00]: regular beans and with some of these
things the way they pair together but all
[SPEAKER_00]: of a sudden you're like, oh where did this
off you come because like 80% 85% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time you're gonna get like one of the
skittles all of the skittles the orange a
[SPEAKER_00]: combination like Depending on the color
you'll get very different variations of
[SPEAKER_00]: color maybe a little bit on Calix
production Fox tailing indoor like heart
[SPEAKER_00]: like some are a little bit hotter some are
a little bit, you know Because of that
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain trap like my own crops not a
super hard blood But it's open and it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: great hash maker and the turps are just
off the charts Yes, whereas the Z whiz was
[SPEAKER_00]: a really stacked bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a lot more denser with even more
resin population and then just Super
[SPEAKER_00]: unique terpene profile off the male just
on the stem And then made I have f2s of
[SPEAKER_00]: that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a limited release of those and I
still have I had a oh God I had three of
[SPEAKER_00]: the females and I you know kept those
expressions open to further work Just to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of keep aside and then I wanted to
put a few into some people's hands and see
[SPEAKER_00]: What they were finding before I go any
further?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your idea behind?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pairing some of these up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said it you work with some of the
older stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't mind working with the newer
stuff You're no shy to that obvious,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what is it that like when you're going
after something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that's gonna pair good with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so So let's say like, you know,
you get a clone or you you smoke some from
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been seeing it out there people
growing it you get it you grow it and
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's just something that held tight
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just I caught my eye like man.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's really nice and I think it would
pair well what I'm trying to do and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I consider myself a pretty good
judge of what people like I'm pretty picky
[SPEAKER_00]: and I I know what I like it and everyone
else enjoys its own like man if I I put
[SPEAKER_00]: these two slaves together Even though some
of it's already been done and this you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, there's a bunch of Tropicana cookies
out there and crosses but not this and
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoyed these and I was like,
well, let me while I'm playing around let
[SPEAKER_00]: me make my own version and I guess some of
it was as a caregiver in the state that's
[SPEAKER_00]: Recreational as well and having so many
different stores and all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: things coming up with so many other
caregivers growing I wanted to have my own
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that Were familiar so some of
them all of that trot stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smoked that but not this one because
I own I'm the only one who has and I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: that was some of the reasoning to just
having my own unique genetics So like when
[SPEAKER_00]: people are looking for a certain thing
like oh, I want that I like this but this
[SPEAKER_00]: one's man I just like this one better just
it's a little bit better When I grow it
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just more of what I'm looking for
compared to this one basically trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve Things that I liked but you know,
even if a grape pie, let's say for
[SPEAKER_00]: instance grape pie is an amazing plant And
super tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows like shit and has super small but
That's how is what I was gonna say about
[SPEAKER_00]: the trop, you know, so like all of them
really just not a producer So like I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to make it so it's similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a better producer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah add to add a little more figure to it
add more structure to it some strength
[SPEAKER_00]: blood size more has population Just always
trying to improve on it not taking really
[SPEAKER_00]: away from them, but definitely add and
influence it positively You're finding
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars that you really like and you're
making them better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're Seeing the flaws and pairing the
male with it that I think at least the
[SPEAKER_00]: males that I have my stable and using them
To their benefit not just making it just
[SPEAKER_00]: to make it and don't get me wrong Some of
them in there were just really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: females and I'm some of it I probably will
never release but some of it I've added in
[SPEAKER_00]: To it just to say just have a different
off you like man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cheese is really good But she's kind
of girls like shit, too Like it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: small buds, but fucking weeds amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got this really great high It's
reminiscent of good times that I've had my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends of past Pain in the ass and tickle
some of them are like piggy on feed Some
[SPEAKER_00]: of them are super stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them just aren't stretching it all
you can fetch them forever So I guess like
[SPEAKER_00]: when I did some skittles work like
skittles is an amazing cultivator ugly
[SPEAKER_00]: flower Super tasty flower though.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get you smoke the real skittles You
know as well as I do as good as from the
[SPEAKER_00]: first hit all the way down to the last
Super well, so she takes so long on veg So
[SPEAKER_00]: some guys like oh, you know, it's a
nine-week strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a nine-week strain, but if I didn't
add This to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know like always trying to make
it better Sometimes the females only bring
[SPEAKER_00]: in color and hash production Other than
that, she's not bringing anything else
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe her name because people are known
for her and I'm always gonna keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: Transparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna say yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it is and some people like
oh, man I drew that green pipe shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't give me it well try this one
this is why we Cross these things and try
[SPEAKER_00]: to make them better because it really does
have some amazing That's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never did get to get to grow that
great pie But I was going to say that
[SPEAKER_01]: about that trop, you know, you definitely
improved on that I've always loved the
[SPEAKER_01]: taste of the trop cookies, but every Time
I've grown it or had a phenotype and an
[SPEAKER_01]: out crossing of it that leans heavy
towards the trop side It's got beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes great the potencies and the
yield shit Yeah, you'll shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of wispy a little They're not
very dense buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not rocks by any means and small
just really small blood sets Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I definitely did not have that problem
with the Mountain Wizard at all I was
[SPEAKER_01]: getting phenotypes that express that
flavor but with the skittles we yield the
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful Bag appeal the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the bud flower shape on it
Honestly, yeah That's kind of you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really trying to influence that blood
structure Make it so it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: easier to trim like so when I say like in
a positive way Like I want guys to not
[SPEAKER_00]: only get the yield but it's better
trimming So like if it's better trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: that's more production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more productive
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would say that's one of your goals
as well as that bracta leaf ratio Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want that I definitely are always
thinking thinking about the grower and the
[SPEAKER_00]: caregiver and just even down to the
patient making it Streamlining every part
[SPEAKER_00]: of that whole process Oh, yeah,
but giving them something that's like all
[SPEAKER_00]: walls familiar damn man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pretty damn close to what I was
saying But I get look how much better it
[SPEAKER_00]: is like and I think a lot of guys want to
do that That's my main goal though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always trying to make it better That's why
I like that grapefruit is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything it touches it just turns it to go
the mail Me and Chris was sending back you
[SPEAKER_00]: as you know, it's on there's a copy in
this F2 mail is that I can't let it go
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so nice, you know and I'm like
well did it grow like this and this and
[SPEAKER_00]: this because I remember from projects in
the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of what I was looking for and
then sending me pictures and So when I
[SPEAKER_00]: went into my population going back in to
do some further work with it That's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of what I was looking for as well Super
fast effect that bail out of all of them
[SPEAKER_00]: My god, it would eat anything you could
throw to it not picky at all Not that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a super heavy feeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not picky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you shouldn't know Really had a hard
time as far as like the nutrient regimen
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you know not at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another thing all the way down
to that and I don't get me wrong some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these just like some of the chems and the
oldest trains like some of them are just
[SPEAKER_00]: like I want food like But at the end of
the day especially with cost just rising
[SPEAKER_00]: electric bills just rising soil and
Nutrients and just all of those things
[SPEAKER_00]: that was I was always trying to shave
costs myself in a smart way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that's part of business So if I can
shave off either some veg time because I
[SPEAKER_00]: added figure But yet still kept the same
quality that I was looking for and results
[SPEAKER_00]: There's my influence on always looking to
definitely make a positive Influence so
[SPEAKER_00]: that way it's just a better product easier
to work with yet similar In the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: time you're putting you know, like you
said the caregiver and the patient in your
[SPEAKER_01]: forefront of what you're breeding That's
pretty damn cool Maddie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like I'm a patient myself So I put
the care into it that I want for myself
[SPEAKER_00]: that I put into it for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Amen.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right before we get going to break
here really quick You have a seed bank
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're running over there on the East
Coast, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes What's the website for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's shut that out really quick That is
mainly merchandise calm it is spelt and a
[SPEAKER_00]: I NE main ly merchandise and er CHN a ND I
s e calm mainly mainly merchandise calm
[SPEAKER_00]: guys I carry You'll find all kinds of good
genetics there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have Stuff from relic and dynasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have Some other guys on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of taken off a couple of the
breeders for no specific reason other than
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just wanting to do more in New England
based and Then people that I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: working with which is Chris like I've been
working with Chris the longest out of
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone and have the utmost respect for
crystal I will always do that and As long
[SPEAKER_00]: as until I can for sure And then my other
buddy from Vermont inspirational seed goes
[SPEAKER_00]: through so Good deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, check out the website guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: He definitely I would love for you guys to
do that right now Unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no payment option on it,
but you can leave a message on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can figure out all those details No
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're gonna go to break really
quick We'll be right back with solo farms
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're gonna talk more about some of
his old other cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got going on
[SPEAKER_01]: What is up everybody Wow, we are on a
short break I want to give a quick shout
[SPEAKER_01]: out to a sponsor and affiliate of the show
coconut sensors If you guys have ever been
[SPEAKER_01]: like me, you probably bought a $10 Crappy
ass sensor that you were throwing on the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom of your tent Checking the
environment from place that isn't gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: monitor where you want it to be monitored
You have to get into the tent just to
[SPEAKER_01]: check on it which disrupts your
environment as is no longer have to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that with coconut you guys can go over to
KOKONAUT.com that's coconut.com use code
[SPEAKER_01]: calex at checkout That's all cat C-A-O-Y-X
to get a truly portable wireless Wi-Fi
[SPEAKER_01]: device that brings climate insight into
the palm of your hands push notifications
[SPEAKER_01]: directly to your phone keep you in dial
with your environment data 100% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: time go check them out at coconut.com
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we are back with solo farms We
just had a smoke break.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to talk about genetics a little bit
I am now smoking on a very orange fino
[SPEAKER_01]: that I pulled out of the mountain wizard
We were talking about that before the
[SPEAKER_01]: break the mountain wizard the grapefruit I
want to talk about some of the other stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're really proud of that you made
What has popped out where how many
[SPEAKER_01]: different strains now quite a few you have
a lot on your website That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's so many but out of all of
them, which one stuck out So the oh god,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think out of the pancakes out of the
pancakes work stuffed strawberry crepes
[SPEAKER_00]: That the pink the London pound cake on
kushman's 11 times the strawberry cough
[SPEAKER_00]: from kush now kushman Just an amazing
plant all the way around Inside outside
[SPEAKER_00]: works really well up here to be honest the
strawberry cough You know another one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those that was a really tough Super long
vegging plant and just no stretch
[SPEAKER_00]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah But yeah, and just took forever just
ever just keep going super coughed on it
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I don't mind as long as I'm actually
at the end of it It's worth that time
[SPEAKER_00]: enough one way or another right,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always worth it one way or another
especially for the Terps She wasn't always
[SPEAKER_00]: the prettiest looking flower so The
pancakes added a little bit kind of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: makeover as far as visual appearance a
tighter nub structure easier to trim
[SPEAKER_00]: better Taylor's leaf ratio Shorten the
flower time Added a different high to it
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely a different its depth to the
flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was not nice is that on that
particular strain everything that we found
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything that everyone else is
finding is that it I was so grateful that
[SPEAKER_00]: the mail didn't take away from that
strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you hear strawberry you're
looking for that at least you know that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of red berry and It's just tried and
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best part of it was that it added it
took away the veg time Gave it a better
[SPEAKER_00]: spacing while keeping the bunch the buds
good size and Overall weight you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a yield now better hash production
better bag appeal a better overall I think
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeling then effects from it didn't just
limit limit it to that Sativa as it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa dominant hybrid, but you will find
certain G if you knows of that Will lean a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more towards, you know the
strawberry end of it, but that was really
[SPEAKER_00]: one of my favorites out of that super nice
the other one that I really like out of
[SPEAKER_00]: those were the Boot camp breakfast as well
Super nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pay they just linked together just
amazing the colors from both ends I was
[SPEAKER_00]: the other thing that and what was across
on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the London pound cake on
Christmas the pancakes mail time Military
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate, which I phenotype from seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got from only see go Okay, and you found
a really nice, you know of it that Out of
[SPEAKER_00]: all of them that just stood out out of all
of it super chocolatey earthy Just the
[SPEAKER_00]: most resinous out of all of them nice
blood structure not super huge buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they were rocks and Rezzes cut of
Bubba times the Tropicana F2 okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that that's what makes up the military
chocolate and So the cookies added that
[SPEAKER_00]: hardness to it obviously the Resin to the
bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the bubble for the medicinal value
Obviously the bud size, you know nice
[SPEAKER_00]: girth to it and then the colors,
you know that's the other thing that I
[SPEAKER_00]: failed to mention with the Stuffed
strawberry crepes is the you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll get colors coming out of all of
that Pancakes mail definitely some
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful colors coming out of those So
that's another thing to look forward to
[SPEAKER_00]: that anything from purple to reds So then
you add that to strawberry and it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: instant bag appeal and visual Turpines
man, just really nice Good deal,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know two of them the ones that really
caught my eye that I picked I actually
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, there's one that we can't even
ignore now that we've talked about the
[SPEAKER_01]: grapefruit for so long Is that new one
that I grabbed from you the strawberry
[SPEAKER_01]: grapefruit bananas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me you've gone through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know more about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited about it so the 14 or cut is
amazing hash cultivator and amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: terrapins She's always not the best as far
as like flower yield So then my hopes with
[SPEAKER_00]: the grapefruit was to just add the girth
No for sure and shorten the timeline while
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping the hash there add another layer
of flavor Super nice like I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries bananas grapefruits like it's
just fruity super terapy I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so much gas out there that fruit
that is a hash producer but with a
[SPEAKER_00]: different level of citrus on to it that
influence is just Something that will be
[SPEAKER_00]: unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah so that's kind of what I was looking
forward to improve on that straw Nana
[SPEAKER_00]: while keeping like Definitely all the
unique characteristics of it and the
[SPEAKER_00]: positive from it that people enjoy I can't
really hear you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an ash producer and that's one of the
things that I appreciate about you Maddie
[SPEAKER_01]: is a lot of people know me for like
hunting through land races or fucking with
[SPEAKER_01]: true hybrids or heirlooms and Things like
that and I'm just not into a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: more modern stuff But one of the things
that I constantly tell my guys is if I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna fuck with modern genetics like it's
gonna be Maddie's He's already impressed
[SPEAKER_01]: me multiple times and now you're taking my
fucking the one I love grapefruit and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: not so familiar with the straw Nana I have
smoked it a couple times and I love the
[SPEAKER_01]: turps on it But I did grow the strawberry
mamba number four for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're familiar with that
one I've never played with it myself Very
[SPEAKER_01]: similar to like the straw Nana flavors
with less of the banana eat more focus on
[SPEAKER_01]: that strawberry but a very very similar
strawberry taste and I've grown that one
[SPEAKER_01]: so much just because of the flavor on it
and I cannot see that matchup between your
[SPEAKER_01]: straw Nana and the and the grapefruit
going bad in any way I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everything that we've seen is just
Wow Is just another one yeah, you know and
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm in that stage right now where
I'm really I'm doing a lot more dabs my
[SPEAKER_01]: wife She's a huge adapter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So concentrates has been a big focus in
our garden lately And that's like you said
[SPEAKER_01]: this is one of the things that you kind of
breed for is half Yeah, so Taking you know
[SPEAKER_01]: in a lot of those old cultivars They don't
have a return like some of the more modern
[SPEAKER_01]: ones do the resin populations just weren't
is bred in at that time, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, they just weren't so it's nice to have
some things that you're putting out there
[SPEAKER_01]: like this that are more modern get that
hash production so we can really enjoy
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking around learning hash Oh,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just love to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many Other things now,
that's why I'm trying to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting them but you know always
looking for new hash companies anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: that is doing really amazing work with
some of this extractions and or
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrocarbon extractions that slowly
looking for those type of things Love to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with a few and am working with
guys that are doing that and I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: an amazing combo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always enjoyed that the most don't
get me wrong I'm a flower person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always smoked flower, but I think a
healthier Way of consuming the cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I believe it's super enjoyable The
one good thing about Martin cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: the testing and all the good things So
there's a little bit more transparency on
[SPEAKER_00]: products that patients are able to receive
So that to me is definitely a plus side on
[SPEAKER_00]: modern cannabis as well and everything
ever changing and the markets it's you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, I'm making sure that everything's
transparent and To be honest with you when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're dealing with patients You should be
putting the utmost care into everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that we do because at the end of the day
this is their medicine and if they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: capable of Supplying their own medicine or
they're in a state that maybe they can't
[SPEAKER_00]: use Yet these genetics and or ones like it
in the right hands, you know Their
[SPEAKER_00]: caregiver or someone else that can do it
for them with that availability to that is
[SPEAKER_00]: just Amazing and thus it should be we have
a responsibility to these people I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if you're gonna put the time
and effort into something that it should
[SPEAKER_00]: be an expression of you so not I'm not
just selling or Telling people about what
[SPEAKER_00]: I make but I'm also telling them about me
and That's just as it's an important part
[SPEAKER_00]: of it because that's why in What
influenced what everyone is seeing now and
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to see it has been seen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm just it opens up every day to
more and more people And I'm you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go right back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ever so ever grateful And just humbled
that I'm still able To keep doing what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing and put smiles on people's faces
That's the biggest part to me and seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: people get relief because at the end of
the day when I started this I did it for
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was a patient and Some of it it was
easier for me to be a patient and take the
[SPEAKER_00]: street element out of it and do these
things for myself I like So let's get a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple quick fire questions in before we
get going here I had one of my patreon
[SPEAKER_01]: members cue ball had a couple questions
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted to know What have you produced?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one of your cultivars is?
[SPEAKER_01]: The strongest on the nose which one's
gonna pack that in your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the first one that comes to mind as
far as your nose?
[SPEAKER_00]: anything with that the the Z whiz mail
everything with that Z whiz now and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the grapefruit Grapefruit is just that's
what she is Yeah, they just do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's uh, it's just so prominent No matter
what it touched.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't gonna you can't water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the reason why keeping all my
expressions open So it doesn't get muddled
[SPEAKER_00]: or bottled back into just one thing That
was my biggest fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep the church alive and the
terpenes alive because I can always
[SPEAKER_00]: improve on For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also wanted to know how you went about
your pollinations when you Find a male
[SPEAKER_01]: that you want to work with is it you're
sticking it in a room with everything That
[SPEAKER_01]: you think it might pair up well with or
are you more?
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking the role of the bee and hand
pollinating so no to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to open pollinate so I like to have
the males in with the females and
[SPEAKER_00]: Throughout the process I will collect some
pollen and the only reason that I'll go in
[SPEAKER_00]: and touch certain things is just for
consistency throughout the plant For the
[SPEAKER_00]: most part I let it do its own natural
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's all it's supposed to Be
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I help influence that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have I have gone in and say like if it's
in the corner of the room Even though I
[SPEAKER_00]: rotate the plants if it's like in the
middle of the plant and I feel like it
[SPEAKER_00]: might not get as much of the pollen as I
needed to I'll go in and hit a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: racks just to ensure But the biggest my
thing is open pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope about How do you limit yourself on
how many males you would use in that room?
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you're taking females with
different expressions that you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: that you want to put forward in that next
generation but how do you know it's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be two or three in our How do I get it
down like I'm one strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I narrow it down to one or how do
I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you're doing one male with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Each train that I've picked the male from
is the biggest things are stability
[SPEAKER_00]: resilience As far as stress it can handle
all the stresses that I'm and then on that
[SPEAKER_00]: positive note if it passes those tests It
has something to bring to the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always gonna make whatever female
that I'm Pairing with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's always to make it cool Okay,
so you're looking for something that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna pass on any unwanted straights,
but keep still keep the genetic lines open
[SPEAKER_01]: enough Where there's enough possibilities
from all over the board within that strain
[SPEAKER_01]: that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's be that's awesome That's my biggest
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm looking for in the mail
and then I choose to keep them You know
[SPEAKER_00]: the F on the grapefruits in the beginning
We used a couple different males and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we just kept the mail and then due to
unforeseen circumstances Wasn't able to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then moving forward going through a
huge building project with The building I
[SPEAKER_00]: just didn't have the time to either keep
played didn't have time or a space to play
[SPEAKER_00]: games with Doing that at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was you know the reason for
talking with Chris To keep things moving
[SPEAKER_00]: forward while I could and also to him I
knew he would love them just because he's
[SPEAKER_00]: a pure sativa citrus tropical fruit person
who remembers this grapefruit and Enjoyed
[SPEAKER_00]: it just as much As all of us have oh hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah It's definitely a good icebreaker
strain when I talk about the grapefruit I
[SPEAKER_01]: can always tell some of the guys that have
been growing a little bit longer because
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll break out and be like,
oh, yeah, man I remember the sweet pink,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know We used to grow that out door
because it was so it was a tried-and-true
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like she was like one of those that
fell between the cracks Like a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: other amazing Cultivators as well,
but Well, wasn't it it was originally a
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk phenotype Cindy 99 That's right
sweet tooth northern lights Originally
[SPEAKER_01]: came out of British Columbia There was
more in it than just the c99 that is what
[SPEAKER_01]: it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes c99.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where that's that citrus came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep At least that's what's documented
anyway of what I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, there's only so much that we
can Know if you weren't there Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it's a little deeper than just that
but just for a basic like a basic that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like the founding right there the
building blocks so to say For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did you have any shows coming up?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do I have oh God we have the bonfire
coming up in April Which is down in
[SPEAKER_00]: Lebanon, Maine we also have a MMC M show
coming in August and Augusta name for
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll be a two-day show and then we
always have every two weeks we do a show
[SPEAKER_00]: here the local people and Just to get you
know, all these guys with a bunch of you
[SPEAKER_00]: know They get to meet a bunch of different
caregivers and guys like myself as well So
[SPEAKER_00]: they get you know, some of these genetics
in their hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, you know without those they
wouldn't be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool that you're still taking time
out for the locals though That's awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, really I mean that's always always
to those roots because that's where it all
[SPEAKER_00]: started.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's what it is I mean,
I was one of those patients before
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always keep it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never forget never ever upcoming sale Next
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know sometime between the
beginning of the month and Valentine's Day
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be dropping a spring fling sale is
what I'm calling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming up soon and Yeah, be really
soon You know trying to get some more of
[SPEAKER_00]: these packs into guys hands with the
upcoming season coming up and some new
[SPEAKER_00]: things Maybe it's your garden if you're a
caregiver Trying to diversify devise
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself as far as being in Dispensaries
or your local shops and having something
[SPEAKER_00]: different so it's not all the same keeping
that market open and Regular instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: just everyone always doing the same thing
I think that's the future and keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: things like this and from other people
that I work with is a good way to start
[SPEAKER_00]: That other like I said that release that
three pack Release that I did of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sorbet the savory sorbet and then that
strawberry Strawberry grapefruit bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to Do another drop of those like
50 packs and I'm just gonna run it till
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gone and depending on when I start
It'll probably run to the end of February
[SPEAKER_00]: Good cuz I'm gonna do the following month
up until now to like July.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna do a different Seed sale every
month coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way if you did happen to Miss out
on the February sale to be one up and
[SPEAKER_00]: coming so that way everybody gets a chance
That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just want to make sure that the
availability is there and give people a
[SPEAKER_01]: shot Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was definitely trying to give other
people the opportunity To get some of
[SPEAKER_01]: those strawberry grapefruit banana for you
and not hoard them I'm glad you're putting
[SPEAKER_00]: them back out there because I still want
more The other one that really went like
[SPEAKER_00]: the sorbet went I think once everybody
sees it the ones that went out once
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody starts seeing those but the The
savory sorbet that a sideberry gelato onto
[SPEAKER_00]: the Cushman's 11 times GMO Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did send me some of those no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never grew the Cushman's I died never
Even seen it honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, I smoked so much old shit
and that's what I'm hunting through all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time It's pretty you know,
other than you and professor peas gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of modern stuff I grow
what was so great about the Cushman's The
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger it was like I like this particular
gelato hybrid it Doesn't have it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: like but the 41 is good my personal
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed the flavor of The 33 I
hate the veg time on it But the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: structure the effects from it are
medicinal as well also adds I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously a beautiful color without
influence in the flavor in a negative way
[SPEAKER_00]: and so my Obviously again trying to make
it better and less veg time to it the mail
[SPEAKER_00]: had amazing color to it and then it was
just like Creamy Joey gassy heavy resin
[SPEAKER_00]: populations Amongst the calyxes just
really super dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another reason why I wanted to use it
basically the same reason why I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: use the disease is but to have a different
flavor and then add it to Similar things
[SPEAKER_00]: and or different things as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I made f2s of those and and then
obviously a multitude of hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything she touches as far as a gelato
like she actually has that same bud
[SPEAKER_00]: structure as the 33 more denser from the
Cushman's Really harder like definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: harder buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna get your weight and then like
such a dense resin population now the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing I didn't like about the gelato 33
unlike the 41 is that the 41 had Better
[SPEAKER_00]: heads it more resin the 33 had resin Super
nice high but as far as extracts,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really wasn't a great yield So I'm like
man, I'd really like to get this terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile Possibly maybe even draw some
color out of it But I'd love to pack some
[SPEAKER_00]: more resin in this thing and that's what
that mail brings to the table nice That's
[SPEAKER_00]: good to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exciting man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're really nice everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been going through those are just
super excited definitely happy about all
[SPEAKER_00]: the results they're getting and Yeah,
I can all be like there'll be some more
[SPEAKER_00]: future work with those too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I look forward to that as well to
seeing what everybody's Keep on hearing
[SPEAKER_00]: what everybody's saying about them keep
getting them out there some more people
[SPEAKER_00]: get them and start really looking at
bigger populations of them and I'd love to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear all the unique things that come out
of it man, you know, just like your story
[SPEAKER_01]: with the with the mountain wizard That was
so fun that entire hunt there was so many
[SPEAKER_01]: expressions and none of them were bad It
was just a pleasing hunt all around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, they were really really
Resilient to everything stable beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: bag appeal was off the wall some more than
others, but all of them were good Every
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor every smell every high it was all
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not have one complaint throughout
that entire thing Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, before we get going here we got
to ask you some of the hard questions Oh
[SPEAKER_01]: boy Our lead content creator this one of
his favorite questions for me to ask you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys Grow green daddy over there on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: He always wants to know what We try to get
three if there's only one there's one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hard hard question, but at the end
of everything when you're Gone,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you want to represent your name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which strain are you like or which
cultivar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which type are you working on where you're
like?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I put my most like most of my
passion most my energy into this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was my pride and joy easy just like
that boat The other ones are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love them all but the grapefruit like
hands down is down if you had to name a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple more that you thought were Really
close to that is there anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh You're like I think this represents
solo so God I do have an answer for that
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a super hard question so I'd have to
say that and see what his work is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of that work and I really am
because of The time it took to pair
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that I put in to pair with it
with that intention Knowing that it would
[SPEAKER_00]: pair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I guess The other one I really like
that's a part one of that sub.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a sub part of that second part,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that I'm really second most proud
of is just still not available to anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh as things come forward in the future
You and a few other specific people will
[SPEAKER_00]: get those in their hands for so many
reasons and First off is just the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of passion love and dedication That you
put into it amongst a few other some very
[SPEAKER_00]: select individuals that I really want to
get these into your hands because I know
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of the day you guys are gonna
do the best work for Yourselves and myself
[SPEAKER_00]: included for the common good for everyone
else Some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I can't say what it is yet,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that definitely something that
I'm super proud of Dude, I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what the fuck it is This
is not something you've told me before you
[SPEAKER_01]: just dropped this on me during the podcast
So maybe something to keep Everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: looking forward to I know I am I'm so
looking forward to it Hell yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: are we working with the time frame here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that I'd say by 2024 they will
be Like maybe the end of 2023 to 2024 just
[SPEAKER_00]: depends On how everything works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's just really I could all within a
three to six month of that I would say
[SPEAKER_01]: that's that's the best guesstimate that I
You know, that's a good thing though That
[SPEAKER_01]: is a good thing if you're already excited
about it now and you've got that much more
[SPEAKER_01]: time to work with it Cuz no one knows
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you got to keep it that way
There's I can't even fill up on one hand
[SPEAKER_00]: how many people know Good and or are
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so This right here is gonna be
another testament.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping for fall Late winter like maybe
early winter for f5 work We'll see we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: just see how on the grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah on the grapefruit f5s And I'm looking
forward to those as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I just want people to keep
enjoying these after Don't think that The
[SPEAKER_00]: f4 is gonna be like the f5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that it's not gonna be a better
version It's just going to be I'm using a
[SPEAKER_00]: different expression from the original
expression the f2s and then Going into
[SPEAKER_00]: another like, you know, I had the a b c
and d I'm going into another one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: because I Was just a few different reasons
And I think it's really just gonna end up
[SPEAKER_00]: because the end goal for me is to I always
want to keep that Expression I'm not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be selfish and say all you get is sweet
pink grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Don't want anyone to ever get that I
still want everyone to get and find those
[SPEAKER_00]: unique ones that make their garden stand
out Really helps them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want everybody to experience everything
grapefruit has to offer Well, yeah exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like kind of pick your own version
of it that you like because everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: taste buds are just a little different
Yeah, and what I smell doesn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: mean you do or taste Yeah, same plant,
but everyone can get that taste big,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, depending like if you're a
cigarette smoker You're gonna taste it
[SPEAKER_00]: different if you're this, you know,
there's too many variables, but I'm trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to definitely keep it where it's open It
keeps everybody kind of like wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then wow, what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy, you know Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very with the f5 project people can
look forward to Which I think with the f4
[SPEAKER_00]: is I kind of knit I mean For the most part
everything that I'm seeing and hearing and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that we've seen all the bud
structures just the good size flower sets
[SPEAKER_00]: and nothing too crazy, but I think if
anything Out of all of it is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: getting some more of a maybe more uniform
not so much of actual structure but size
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the cross and or the Some
could be more Fox Taylor than others and
[SPEAKER_00]: vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Good, so we're starting to see a lot
more uniformity in the population Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean a little bit more but then also my
biggest thing is to keep the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile open but Awesome, dude.
