[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And welcome to another exciting episode of
the Calix and crew podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a very notorious guest today.
[SPEAKER_01]: None other than the man himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her feet is on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing, Terp?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on, dog?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was actually a reschedule.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had scheduled this in February and I
had some surgery and some other stuff that
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to deal with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you so much for putting up with
me and having me back and worked it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that we finally got you on here,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you smoking on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I see you lighting something up over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is Chiquita berries.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was originally a Chiquita OG cross to I
mean, a Chiquita bananas cut cross to a it
[SPEAKER_03]: was some sort of like cookie berries.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's from a 209 Stone City Genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went into it looking for something
banana and I found anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was burnt match heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bad perm like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just a complete opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the best way, like, you know,
I went in looking for one thing and what I
[SPEAKER_03]: found wasn't that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was so much better.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it I didn't go into it looking
for something kind of on that funky,
[SPEAKER_03]: really almost burnt nasty end.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it kicks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kicks really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it be fair to say that you're kind
of into those offenses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of terpenes?
[SPEAKER_03]: We can have a whole discussion about the
pooping fetish.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has become a very, very hot
discussion topic lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've we've probably discussed it on six
or eight different podcasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: The growing fetish of describing just how
nasty and foul and odiferous your weed is
[SPEAKER_03]: and just that become a whole subculture
now of the more spoiled, rancid rank,
[SPEAKER_03]: the better, you know, and yeah,
it's becoming a new thing of just there's
[SPEAKER_03]: this whole subculture of people that hit
me up and it's just like, what's the nasty
[SPEAKER_03]: you got anything that smells like a old
diaper that's been out for two weeks?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, yeah, I'm sure I got something
for you, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, well, you know, they don't call me
terfing for nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What definitely puts you with a flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's become like, you know,
it kind of became one of those things like
[SPEAKER_03]: we all kind of do it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we started talking about the fact
that we all do it a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're like, yeah, I'm looking for
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we're burnt perm wrapped in hair
with some skunk and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a baby diaper.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it's it's just the descriptions
and descriptions and the descriptors of of
[SPEAKER_03]: rancid weed has become a whole subculture
lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a big part of that is the shock
value attached to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if I say, hey, I've got
something that's super blueberry terfing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to be like, hey, there's a
lot of blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I'm like, OK, well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got roadkill skunk, you got your
tennis ball and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've got this Pakistani chocolate tie
that's fucking tastes like you're sucking
[SPEAKER_01]: on the wet stuff that's at the bottom of
your garbage trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be like, oh, you know,
it's the shock value.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of it has been a lot of
other artists.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it's kind of been on the back of
like a lot of the chem strains I found,
[SPEAKER_03]: like as those of GMO and stuff like that,
as those kind of strains have become more
[SPEAKER_03]: popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're starting to see a lot more of like
savory, you know, stuff that's not just
[SPEAKER_03]: simple fruit turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the people that love it, love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a lot of people that go,
I don't know if I want my weed to smell
[SPEAKER_03]: like diarrhea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the truth is, it's it's a niche.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of call it the pooping fetish is
it is very much a niche thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the people that love those funky nasty
turps, that's what they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't they're almost the sort of sort
of people that don't want fruity weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you have to appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's got a flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's got a change.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's got something that they're
really into.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so it's like, I've always said
my whole thing for minute one was to try
[SPEAKER_03]: and cover all the bases.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anybody that hit me up and said I want
a flavor, I got something for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really doesn't matter what corner
or niche of the weed market you're into.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to find focus on a little bit of
something across the board.
[SPEAKER_03]: So any customer hits me up and says,
hey, I need a I need a gassy strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a fruity strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a strain that's just turps beyond
anything anybody's seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, let me get personal with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got something for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's for turfy?
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's where it comes from,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it comes from a I have tolerance
issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been smoking for a little while.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a little bit of the thing that
I found to deal with that the best is to
[SPEAKER_03]: constantly keep a different strain on
deck.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have real bad ADD with any strain in
that I'll smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then 15 minutes later, it was the
greatest thing I ever had.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm over it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lot of it comes from just my
desire and my need to find stronger
[SPEAKER_03]: strains, to find strains that fit
particular niches and anything that will
[SPEAKER_03]: kick through that tolerance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Issue of like, you know, look,
man, I'm traditionally a dabber like 90
[SPEAKER_03]: percent of the time I'm smoking hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found it kind of easier to smoke flour
on podcasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it gets one of those things that,
you know, I'll puff a couple of joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, really, in my pursuit of
flour, it's always been flavor unique and
[SPEAKER_03]: something that will cut through something
that's going to get, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: past everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's usually the jar I grab.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's tough to say what my favorite flavor
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which part?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so yeah, so like I'm just saying,
like, I'm looking for a strain that if I
[SPEAKER_03]: have eight jars on the table, that's the
one that's going to kick me the hardest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the one I'm going to grab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I always say it's the jar that goes
empty first.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_03]: And see, the big the big problem that we
have, one of the big problems that I feel
[SPEAKER_03]: like we have in cannabis right now is kind
of the misconception that high THC is the
[SPEAKER_03]: best and that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you walk into a dispensary,
when you're buying weed, it's just what's
[SPEAKER_03]: the THC content?
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not the best way to buy weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And quite simply because the highest THC
isn't always going to be the one that gets
[SPEAKER_03]: you the highest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that sounds funny because your
immediate thought is 18 percent is not
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get me as high as 30 percent
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The truth is 18 percent with high THC and
high Mersene levels will get you higher
[SPEAKER_03]: than 30 percent weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that sounds funny, but we have,
you know, we have a ton of discussions all
[SPEAKER_03]: the time about ancillary terpenes,
about, you know, terpenes in general and
[SPEAKER_03]: how they modulate specifically Mersene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've known for years and years
Mersene helps THC cross the blood brain
[SPEAKER_03]: barrier.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why for years you heard the joke
about eat some mangoes or, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: chew on some peppercorns.
[SPEAKER_03]: You ever chewed on peppercorns?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some that's hardcore, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: A heavier carrier filing or is there a
significant amount of Mersene?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also significant amounts of
Mersene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with with those higher elevated and
that's generally why Mersene in most of my
[SPEAKER_03]: strains, I like that to be the first
terpene on the list, the one that has the
[SPEAKER_03]: most terps of all the others, because
quite simply you're going to get higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what I've seen this from is I'll take
strains that are 18, 20 percent,
[SPEAKER_03]: but with higher Mersene levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll have people come back and say,
I can't smoke that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I've had people literally tell me,
like, my customers are afraid of the
[SPEAKER_03]: blackout truffle just simply because it's
a higher Mersene strain, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 percent, 20 percent plus THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no slouch.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like 30 percent THC usually comes
at the sake of sacrificing terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, there's only so much room in a
trichome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if in that trichome, the predominant
oil is THC, the predominant chemical is
[SPEAKER_03]: THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's less room for other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, there will always be a
market for high THC strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that's just it's the marketability.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy to sell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your average customer says THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as we go down the line more and more,
we start to realize that heavy terps and
[SPEAKER_03]: the right terp blends matter a lot more
than 30 percent terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, 30 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's why I say for me,
as much as I love flavors and I love
[SPEAKER_03]: different flavors and I love you know,
for me, it's the variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it's the chase.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it's what haven't I seen yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've seen some awesome strains,
you know, through 20 years plus of popping
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds like I've seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen the evolution of weed as we know
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I started growing in the in the
late 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, there weren't genetically
there weren't a ton of options back there
[SPEAKER_03]: back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your options were either Mark Emery's
catalog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam, maybe go to Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was that was about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, there wasn't nearly the flood
of genetic diversity that we have today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then not only that, but the the
problems that we encountered trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: acquire genetics or even having them in
our area limited that pool even more for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that we were talking
about the other day is some of those old
[SPEAKER_01]: strains, you know, you get a nice Panama
red or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's only testing what 15 to 18 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the cannabinoid profile and it's how
those cannabinoids interact with each
[SPEAKER_01]: other to give you that high.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing that we're seeing kind of
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So back in the 90s, when I started
growing, there were still a lot of those
[SPEAKER_03]: very basic profile strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was either piney or it was skunky or
it was berry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But back then it was kind of rare that you
would hit a strain and you'd go,
[SPEAKER_03]: man, there's so much going on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't really describe all of this,
you know, and in the world of poly
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrids, in the world of, you know,
everybody with a closet can be a breeder
[SPEAKER_03]: and can make their own seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really now seeing the true diversity
of the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more people breeding now,
more people growing weed than at any point
[SPEAKER_03]: in history.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sheer amount of weed that's being
grown because it's done legally in so many
[SPEAKER_03]: places now is far surpassing anything
we've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the beautiful part of that is we're
seeing the expansion of the gene pool at
[SPEAKER_03]: such a rate that it's really tough to tell
you what what tomorrow holds in the simple
[SPEAKER_03]: fact that we're also seeing, along with
all these poly hybrids and all these,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, multi crosses, we're also seeing
so many people going back to some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: older stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're seeing people reworking older
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're seeing people who bust open seed
collections after 10, 15 years and really
[SPEAKER_03]: just start to pull out stuff that,
you know, it meant something to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They collected it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the tragedy of that is, you know,
we keep getting into this discussion about
[SPEAKER_03]: without kicking up a bunch of skunk,
for instance, skunk is one of those
[SPEAKER_03]: profiles that everybody talks about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: We lost all the good skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: We lost all the good skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you think that's the case?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the answer is usually because those
older plants didn't adapt as well to
[SPEAKER_03]: indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were specifically bred in whatever
region they came from largely to be
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoor plants grown in specific
environments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as everything moved indoors,
you know, plants that didn't keep up,
[SPEAKER_03]: plants that harmed too much with skunk,
particularly plants that grew 20 feet tall
[SPEAKER_03]: and didn't really yield all that much
weight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those plants didn't make it long term.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's why I tell people all the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's really important is if you love a
plant, make more seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find a way to make more seeds,
because that guarantees that whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: profile you love, whatever plant you're in
love with makes it to another generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it can be tomorrow's favorite strain,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we don't have to get there and
be like, you remember that one strain in
[SPEAKER_03]: the day?
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish we'd have kept it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, find find two seeds and breed
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find your two favorite strains and breed
them together.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you really be surprised,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what makes sure that those
favorite strains that you love from
[SPEAKER_03]: yesteryear make it onto the next
generation and make it, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: to somebody else to talk about down the
road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't take much work to do a
preservation effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's something that's
extremely important, especially for the
[SPEAKER_01]: future of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember talking to a Patreon member
just like yesterday, I think it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: About how back when I started smoking,
almost everything tasted like pine,
[SPEAKER_01]: like heavy pining or heavy mercy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there wasn't a lot of genetic
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe when we started getting some orange
bud up from Cali or from Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: But almost everything tasted the same,
but it had kind of a different look or it
[SPEAKER_01]: was a little bit heavier in this terpene
than the other one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but about the time of like White
Widow, White Rhino, B.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bud and all that northern light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like that's mainly what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think an important thing to note,
like you were saying, the genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity that we have, we have all these
terpenes that you just don't find in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis showing up more and more often.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more breeders that are out there,
the more people that are breeding towards
[SPEAKER_01]: these different traits than we've ever
seen before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but like when I did the
Egyptian land race, the Sinai,
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say Sinai, I say it fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was one that was very heavy and
granule and granule.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking at because it was apparently
the terpene that was responsible for like
[SPEAKER_01]: stone fruit and peach flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that terpene doesn't just express this
peach, it can express a multitude of ways
[SPEAKER_01]: along that spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not just that one terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like how many is there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of what you're what you're
knocking on here kind of goes back a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit to what we were talking about
in the kind of early to mid 90s as you
[SPEAKER_03]: started to see more breeding specifically
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was generally for high THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were largely breeding for heavy
trichomes, heavy resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at that time, most people weren't
breeding for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in that push to breed higher THC and
higher THC strains, you generally phased
[SPEAKER_03]: out so many ancillary terpenes,
so many of those terpenes that maybe only
[SPEAKER_03]: appear in smaller amounts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as we're seeing now, the other
thing that we see now is the rise in
[SPEAKER_03]: testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we now have more access to testing,
terpene testing, cannabinoid testing than
[SPEAKER_03]: we've ever had before.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still not perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you as a person on the street can't
really just take 100 samples and send them
[SPEAKER_03]: to a lab and get terp tests.
[SPEAKER_03]: But all of the dispensaries, all the legal
entities that are running grows right now
[SPEAKER_03]: all have access to testing of some sort.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what that's doing is we're also we're
starting to see all of these strains that
[SPEAKER_03]: we've had for years and years and years
being run out, documented with test
[SPEAKER_03]: results.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're starting to see that there
are other terpenes there that we weren't
[SPEAKER_03]: even paying attention to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whether it's a concerted effort to
actually breed for specific terp flavors
[SPEAKER_03]: or it's just an effort to we're not as
concerned with high THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're willing to breed for other
things like flavor and for, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: con to other content other than just THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so with so many breeders, you might
have a favorite flavor and it might be
[SPEAKER_03]: some strain that's really high in some
unique or odd terpene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I say really high, really high in
comparison.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these terps that you're mentioning
and especially some of the answers on
cancer, especially the long term terp
blends, like you mentioned, there are some
[SPEAKER_03]: cancelary terps that are kind of there in
smaller amounts.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I see these terp wheels and it's
like, this turps smells like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: lavender and this turps meals.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so tough because in that trichome is
a soup of different terpenes, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: files.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all kinds of flavor molecules.
[SPEAKER_03]: We still don't know what all's because the
best labs are only testing for terpenes
[SPEAKER_03]: and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them aren't testing, I haven't
seen at least, full spectrum tests of
[SPEAKER_03]: everything that's in that resin,
you know, that's in the tricone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the real kick right now is we
keep bringing up, every time we talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: terps, somebody brings up gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody brings up gassy terps and thiols
and skunky terps and thiol.
[SPEAKER_03]: We still don't know what all is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's not something you can really
just call up a lab and say, Hey,
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to test for thiols in my cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most places don't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not to say they can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've never seen a full write up of
every single thing that's in cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like we're still only seeing a
small piece of the picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're seeing the part that we're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's still so many other things
going on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That we still don't really, we're either
not capable of testing for, or we just
[SPEAKER_03]: don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a big thing about,
you know, it's not federally legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's not as much testing that we can
do on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm really glad that you brought that
up because you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is so many terpenes that we know of
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember how many anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it right under 200, something like
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: The other side to it is it's all
commercial based.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like all of the testing that's
generally happening happens for one or two
[SPEAKER_03]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: State regulations or marketing curiosity,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of all of the cannabis
testing that happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to test for things like
pesticides and THC in some states.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some states require terpene testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the truth is those are all done
because it's not in a scientific method.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not because we're just
curious about what all is here and we just
[SPEAKER_03]: want to look and see, or, you know,
it's just, that's not why it's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all literally done to either pass
inspections or because you can use it to
[SPEAKER_03]: market and say, oh, we have, you know,
high terps in this and high terps,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, but most terpene testing is,
it's not done in an exploratory way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, can we figure out what all is
here?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just give me something I can use to
market my strain better when I put it on a
[SPEAKER_03]: shelf to somebody, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that you brought that up though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was going to say, not only like we
talked about, can one terpene express,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a variety of different smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how it interacts with other terpenes
as well is going to change that profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I might inbred line this granule
terpene within my heritage so much where
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's expressing peach.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the minute it comes in contact with a
new terpene that's not used to is really
[SPEAKER_01]: going to change that profile to where it
doesn't express exactly peach anymore.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse Hartley wants to know in terms of
say he wanted, oh, guys, if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: questions, throw them back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucked up the Q&A.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he wanted to know if you had any
problem F toing seeds, if he F toed seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm kind of glad this came up because
this is probably one of my three or four
[SPEAKER_03]: favorite topics to talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm a firm believer in open source
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you purchase a pack of seeds,
those seeds are yours to do as you please.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's male plants there and there's
female plants there, you paid for those
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those plants belong to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how you use them is up to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that means you F to you, and sell them,
that means you F to them and give them
[SPEAKER_03]: away to everybody on the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's your prerogative, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a firm believer that if you're selling
regular sex seeds, you paid for all of
[SPEAKER_03]: those seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They belong to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you want to do with them,
I have no control over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always tell people, I always appreciate
a pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you shoot me a pack just so I can throw
it in the bin and I have a pack,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's not required.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one of those things that I tell
other people, ask your breeder that
[SPEAKER_03]: question and see how many of them tell
you, no, I got no problem with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's a lot of people in the
seed industry that will get super angry
[SPEAKER_03]: about that, will throw fits.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had an old man try to swing on me once.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the funniest, you know,
the ego and the amount of like,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's mine, I'm going to control it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You sold it to somebody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And why are you trying to bite nature?
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They paid for all 10 of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there was nothing on that pack that
said you got to throw half of these in the
[SPEAKER_03]: garbage.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it's the truth is we all eat
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't take a dollar out of my pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you sell F2s of my seeds, people know
that I made the original.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they want the next generation,
they're going to come to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reality is, I can't control it
anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why would I get angry to the point
where I want to fight somebody or yell at
[SPEAKER_03]: people online, I've seen so much over,
you know, people F2 and seeds and then
[SPEAKER_03]: getting their feelings hurt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the truth is, a lot of the people that
get mad about that paid stupid money for
[SPEAKER_03]: their cuts, because they're usually
suckers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why they get so in their
feelings about it, because they've paid a
[SPEAKER_03]: premium to have the cut, or the only cut
or you know, and I don't really work with
[SPEAKER_03]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never paid anybody a significant
amount of money for cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I bought cuts at a dispensary once
years and years back, but like I've never
[SPEAKER_03]: paid somebody 1000s of dollars for a cut
of weed, nor would I.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just wait until you cross it and then
get those and and make my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate to hate to say it, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, I believe firmly in open source
genetics, I believe that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you buy them from the person that made
them because you love them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what you do with them is you I
mean, that's, you know, I'm not in every
[SPEAKER_03]: grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't I can't do anything about it,
even if you did.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I fully support people that do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always joke these are all just crayons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my my biggest desire is that one day
somebody takes one of my crayons and
[SPEAKER_03]: paints a masterpiece.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in that, we can all share.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much to go around.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no lack of genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really think one cut is the end all
be all cut, pop some more seeds because
[SPEAKER_03]: there's there's other stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's better stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time somebody shows me the cut to
end all cuts, I just go, I hope you didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: pay a lot for it, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just better stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not there's so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, there's so much ego in like,
do you have the cut?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the cut?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Such and such.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, are you sure that's the only cut?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you verify that that's the I don't
care.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't I don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care to even have that discussion.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, I would rather make my own
something amazing and sell it to you as
[SPEAKER_03]: something amazing than just rip off
something somebody else is doing and just
[SPEAKER_03]: say, man, I chased down this one and kind
of pay $5,000 for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm going to pimp it out as hard as I
can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just it's not my thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of old school.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like I said, when I came up,
there weren't a lot available to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once I could make them, I literally
just thought of myself as like Johnny
[SPEAKER_03]: Appleseed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I just want to make all the flavors
and I want to try all the flavors and I
[SPEAKER_03]: want to try and I want to spread them as
far as I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I've always tried to keep my
genetics affordable.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do tons of giveaways and freebies and,
you know, like ways for people to get tons
[SPEAKER_03]: of good genetics for reasonable prices.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so many people now, they just assume
because it's an expensive pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've popped them all, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've popped your six, seven,
$800 packs of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've popped the stuff out of Joe's
closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine times out of 10, I'm gonna go with
the closet guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only one or two people at that top
echelon of price that I would spend my
[SPEAKER_03]: money again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, let's be honest,
like most great genetics shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_03]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, unless you're like I said,
you're paying 10 grand for a cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's let's throw a range on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think is an acceptable and
moral price for a pack of seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Minimum to Max.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're talking about anything under an
F5, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: 100 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that Max?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, $100 is the top end of what I,
you know, and this is as a, listen,
[SPEAKER_03]: man, this is as a buyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not necessarily saying this as
somebody who eats off of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying this as somebody who spent 20
years collecting, yeah, yeah, 20 years
[SPEAKER_03]: collecting, you know, 20 years hoarding my
own flavors and my own seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and so for me, if I'm
buying seeds, and it's over 100 bucks a
[SPEAKER_03]: pack, it better be something that I can't
live without, which is real rare for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, I don't I don't get attached
to strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, there's nothing I've ever had
that I wouldn't just say, I'll find
[SPEAKER_03]: another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I found this one, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if we're talking about something F5
or higher, then we get into like,
[SPEAKER_03]: how big is the breeder?
[SPEAKER_03]: How well known is the breeder?
[SPEAKER_03]: How well known is the pedigree of the
genetics that we're talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: If this is some stuff that they've been
growing in in Northern California for 40
[SPEAKER_03]: years, then you can usually guess that
this is of a pedigree that's a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: higher genetically than just across
somebody did in their closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, there's, it just depends
on what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anything under than anything under an
F5, I'd have a hard time paying crazy
[SPEAKER_03]: money for now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's two brands that I would I would I
would kind of make an exception there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're both kind of legacy brands out of
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're on the kind of the upper end.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would I would buy their seeds again
in a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's be honest, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: aficionado and dying breed are the only
two companies that I would take a 100%
[SPEAKER_03]: vouch for every seed that I've popped was
worth every nickel that went into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in a weird position,
like just having an Instagram page and I
[SPEAKER_03]: had people hit me up and just go,
man, I got all these seeds and we went to
[SPEAKER_03]: a cup and we spent a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I'm scared to pop them because
they're so expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I'm going to I'm just going to
screw it up, you know, and it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I had people come to me and like trade
me my seeds for stuff that they had picked
[SPEAKER_03]: up at ups and couldn't, you know,
couldn't bring themselves to run.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I had stuff kind of fall in my lap
at one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just like, I'm gonna run it all
and see what's you know, what's worth
[SPEAKER_03]: running?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's garbage?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's you know, I'll never touch again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in that price range, there's a couple
other brands that, you know, I won't talk
[SPEAKER_03]: negative on anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a couple other brands that I
would I would say are maybe not worth
[SPEAKER_03]: spending that kind of money on unless it's
just something you can't live without,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and you're allowed to have your
opinions, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you don't know what you're buying,
right, if we're just talking about the
[SPEAKER_03]: average seed buyer who sees a three to
$500 pack and goes, is that worth my
[SPEAKER_03]: money?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do the research really heavily at that
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's one thing if you buy a 60
$70 pack of seeds and you got 10 shots to
[SPEAKER_03]: find a winner and let's say nothing comes
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a whole lot different than when
you've invested $500 a pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now every seed needs to be a winner in
your eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have the margin of error because
you've invested so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is I'm talking about your average
seed buyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not talking about the guy that's got
180,000 square foot and an unlimited seed
[SPEAKER_03]: budget.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm talking about your average
collector who's they've been in it for a
[SPEAKER_03]: little while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's these big name brands, and then
goes, what's expensive?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to be good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, why would they charge so much
for it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like those genetics aren't super special.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's ever had them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like once again, that goes back
to the open source nature of genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got in a ton of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Several years ago, when I was talking to
two different breeders, one of them you
[SPEAKER_01]: actually named and we were talking about
that cap that I just asked you about and
[SPEAKER_01]: what's morally and ethically right charge
for a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were talking about there was a
couple of packs that a breeder had put up,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they were asking thousands of dollars
for 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, that's it's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I had another breeder that was
involved with that breeder, hit me up,
[SPEAKER_01]: really go on the defense right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And say, well, you don't know what you're
fucking talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are, you know, have been held for so
many generations and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said at the end of the day, what's going
to come out of that is a plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: albeit maybe an extremely inbred,
well-worked, beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is still a plant and I can't let see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't see it being worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, deep filial inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is only good for breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as a grower, I would never I would
never pay that money for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I get back to if I'm paying
you that kind of money, I'm paying you for
[SPEAKER_03]: the fact that you're selling legacy
strains, you're selling pedigree genetics,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I am going to use them to breed with
because that's the only reason somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: would pay that kind of money for those
names as a grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, there's so many hype strains out
right now that like and it's been a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: of years, I feel like, since we've had
like a really big this is the hype strain
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody has to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't know if it's a little
post-pandemic lol.
[SPEAKER_03]: High Times hasn't been doing as many
events to tell people are niching out
[SPEAKER_01]: more, especially, you know, with you,
me, everybody kind of moving towards
[SPEAKER_01]: discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram's shoving us off.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're canceling us out.
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube's taken down channels like Discord
is I think it's the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think people are going to niche out
like that because I don't have to follow a
[SPEAKER_01]: page of bullshit and scroll through trying
to find Terp Fiend's post today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can just go to Terp Fiend's Discord and
check all that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to just choose Terp Fiend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can choose Terp Fiend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can choose, you know, Calix and crew
podcasters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or whoever I follow and have multiple
Discord accounts that I can pop between
[SPEAKER_01]: and find exactly what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I think that's important to
note right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like you said as well, sadly,
from a grower's perspective, I think a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people nowadays like the high boycott
keeping guys are doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, equating this is a high
price.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be good for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, are this going to be something
extremely special?
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually I find that those people are
basing or how much money can I make off of
[SPEAKER_01]: finding a really good one and selling cuts
of it than keeping it for myself?
[SPEAKER_03]: The truth is, if we've run enough seeds,
if we've all run enough strains,
[SPEAKER_03]: you've seen the most amazing top tier of
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's let's be honest, dank weed is dank
weed, like at the best top point of
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it all comes down to flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much frosty weed and there's so
much it's beautiful and it's just gorgeous
[SPEAKER_03]: nugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what does it taste like?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what really has become the deciding
factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's why we're seeing so
many little niches, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that it comes down to flavor and taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people come to realize, well,
it's like hype doesn't always mean it's
[SPEAKER_03]: the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hype usually meant it looked pretty in a
picture and somebody posted it on the
[SPEAKER_03]: Internet and somebody else went,
I got to have that, you know, or somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: in a marketing company at one of these
large brands has essentially said,
[SPEAKER_03]: now we're pushing out XYZ strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have our rapper rap about
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have our marketing team hit
every social media hard with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be the next thing
everybody's talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's usually what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's branding and marketing more than
just the most amazing strain of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're usually gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you sit down with 10 of the
greatest growers in this country,
[SPEAKER_03]: right, every one of them have frosty dank
nugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one that's going to walk up from that
table and walk away being the one that
[SPEAKER_03]: knew they had the dank was the one whose
jar stank the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we all have jars of stank with,
you know, like any great grower has jars
[SPEAKER_03]: of stinky weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the one that's going to get everybody
is that flavor that makes all the OGs go.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to have the jar that goes the
fastest.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how we always joked about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we all sat down and threw our jars in
the middle of the table and you could
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke anything you wanted all day long,
the jar that empties the fastest is going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be the best one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's almost never just the most
resinous one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always the dankest flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon member Dank Panda wants to know,
I have a pineapple meatball F2 and veg
[SPEAKER_01]: that smells of rank feet and vomit,
but hold or get more putrid flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you haven't gotten the pineapple
flavor on that yet, like so some of those
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of go both ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's kind of a funky pooping.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard people say Italian meatballs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really weird and savory meat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's some that have more
pineapple.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's some that kind of have
both.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like you've got the more meat
breath leaning Fino.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I would I would expect that one
to make your friends kind of run like that
[SPEAKER_03]: when you bust that one out in the car and
somebody is going to think they shit
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once again, man, like that in my
selections, I'm not sure you said F2.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I did the F2s and the F3s,
my goal was to work with plants that
[SPEAKER_03]: exhibited kind of an even mix because the
I think that strain really shines when
[SPEAKER_03]: it's got both the kind of funky rancid
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also got this candy pineapple
thing on the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really does kind of remind you of
like a burnt ham with pineapple rinds on
[SPEAKER_03]: it or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's really unique and meaty.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my favorite ones are kind of an even
blend of the two.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also selected in that line away from
what I like to call the mutant leaf Fino's
[SPEAKER_03]: of meat breath.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can usually tell them about,
you know, a couple of weeks into veg,
[SPEAKER_03]: all the leaves just throw this ugly
mutation and you just go, what's wrong
[SPEAKER_03]: with this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just it's it really just is a
leaf mutation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I found those plants don't tend to be
as vigorous as, you know, profile typical
[SPEAKER_03]: as I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those tend to have just a boring,
cushy profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: As much as I love Kush, like that's not
that wasn't my goal with that line,
[SPEAKER_03]: that line in general, all those pineapple
sorbet crosses just unbelievably complex
[SPEAKER_03]: and unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that meatball.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're probably stuck with the funk
on that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that's what you like.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you need to, we're going to start a
we're going to start a group, essentially
[SPEAKER_03]: a support group.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll figure out where we'll just call it
pooping's anonymous or pooping fetish
[SPEAKER_03]: anonymous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll just we'll just have a forum
where people can kind of talk dirty to
[SPEAKER_03]: each other about the the rank of their
weed and whether, you know, they can argue
[SPEAKER_03]: about whether it smells like feed or,
you know, bad, you know, threads.
[SPEAKER_03]: There really there really needs to be a
place for these people to gather.
[SPEAKER_03]: That guy seemed like he might have had a
little bit of it and been looking for a
[SPEAKER_03]: place to find other like minded pooping
heavy individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got an appreciation for a little bit
of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do love my pooping's.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love some nasty shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just feel like those ones, whatever is
going on with a lot of those file heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: ones just get my head right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That that high is the high that I
typically look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not always, but in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one is dynasty genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow a lot of their gear and he mostly
does like sweet or berry stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yours is one that I've definitely been
looking at as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never grown any of your genetics,
but I really want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very you always send me some.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I mean, I'm giving them to other
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be more than happy to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that that is morally and
ethically correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've gotten seeds from breeders
before, but I always always offer to pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still do even, you know,
I'd never have to pay for seeds from a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could just ask for them, but I still pay
for them just because I think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you got a homie that has a
business like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have like I have one friend that
started up a restaurant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a five star restaurant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's big money like to go in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be an expensive meal,
but I'm still going to go in there and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: still going to spend money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to expect a free meal
because this is my friend and I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: support them, you know, and I think that's
what's important with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even like how many times that's
happened to us and we go in and then the
[SPEAKER_03]: friend still comps the meal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You better get that waitress 20 percent on
top of what the meal was going to cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that lady just had the best night of
her life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you better still leave that money in
that business because that's well,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's the truth of it is that,
you know, so much of us that run
[SPEAKER_03]: businesses on our own, it's it's so much
bigger than any one facet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be the marketing team and you
have to be the, you know, the the grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to be you have to do it all
yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially in this business,
the ones that are still doing it now,
[SPEAKER_03]: even people that love it because the 2020
boom came.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody had those stimulus checks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was easy to be a seed vendor for a year
and a half there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And lots of people made money.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the last year, year and a half,
man, you know, it separated a lot of those
[SPEAKER_03]: people who are just here for a quick buck.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many of those quick seed banks folded
and, you know, that's the business.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen so many of these bust and booms
to the point where it's like it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: uncommon for people right now to not be in
this industry in a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's easy to do weed for a year,
year and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot tougher to do it for 15,
20 years plus because you have to change
[SPEAKER_03]: with the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to realize that the market is
changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you were selling flour,
14, 15, 16, you know, you had a hard time
[SPEAKER_03]: and a hard realization.
[SPEAKER_03]: The market changed drastically.
[SPEAKER_03]: When all these huge legal grows came
online and in legal states, the flour
[SPEAKER_03]: market changed probably irreparably at
this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't know if we'll ever see some
of the high water marks of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: what people were getting for flour there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like so many people have shifted
now into seeds because once again,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's still reasonable money if you know
how to market yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, you got to love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still a market for craft cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just you know, if we're going to compare
different drugs, then we should be
[SPEAKER_01]: comparing this to alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's how you're trying to regulate
it, then we should compare it to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's still a niche for those craft
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, with more
people getting into cannabis, you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to see that big money rush.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like any other industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it starts up, when it's limited,
there's big money in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: After a while, you're going to notice it's
still agriculture, you know, farming,
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what nobody tells anybody that gets
in the weed industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody ever straight tells you it's a
farming, indoor farming, which is very
[SPEAKER_03]: unnatural for 90 percent of the people who
aren't growing in, you know, open fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see too many commercial grows like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's unnatural.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and we're trying to play God and
we're trying to create, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: environments that are perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're trying to, you know,
and I don't know, man, I keep saying that
[SPEAKER_03]: every business that's in business right
now, as soon as it goes federally legal,
[SPEAKER_03]: within three years will get bought out by
a bigger company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once again, all these people will be
pushed out of the industry who are largely
[SPEAKER_03]: just here to make a quick buck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny enough, it's been decades since weed
was a quick buck.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you were growing in the late
90s or early 2000s and you were brave and
[SPEAKER_03]: you had a decent sized black market grow,
you were probably eating OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the overhead and, you know,
it's always been a tough business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the notion that you're just going to
make a bunch of quick, fast money like
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen people make decent money just
moving packs, like just middlemen.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like I've never known an intensely
wealthy grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like even the people that run
most of these large cannabis companies
[SPEAKER_03]: aren't weed people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're people who made money in real
estate, who made money in some other
[SPEAKER_03]: facet.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got investors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them aren't people that spent
their lives in a cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of those people are still just
growing on their own because there's
[SPEAKER_03]: really no money working in another
person's grow making, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: what amounts to, for some people,
a McDonald's manager's salary or less.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like they're not throwing tons
of money at great growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why you've got so much mediocre
weed in dispensaries is because it's grown
[SPEAKER_03]: by a coterie of who just got off the bus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Twenty two, twenty three year old kids who
just love weed and they will work for
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing just to tell their family back
home.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're working in a weed grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little do they know that job only lasts
about six months to a year because once a
[SPEAKER_03]: year they do cyclical firing, get rid of
everybody there and bring in the next set
[SPEAKER_03]: of 20 year old kids who can do it for less
money than you just did.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why all the weed in this,
if you want to quick fast on why all the
[SPEAKER_03]: weed and dispose socks, that's it right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we move on to some more questions,
I wanted to ask you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said you started growing in the 90s,
early 90s, late 90s, late 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was some of those first types that
you were growing?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first handful of plants that I ever
grew were bagsy, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you kind of you kind of mentioned
before we started about chatting about
[SPEAKER_03]: some things that kind of was into.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at about 16, 15, 16, I did my first
fish show of fall 97.
[SPEAKER_03]: From then, like that opened my eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a huge way to weed in general,
because I had, you know, so much more
[SPEAKER_03]: access.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so occasionally you just get some
great weed with just a sprig nugget here
[SPEAKER_03]: or just a seed here or there, you know,
kind of set those aside.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once we finally got to a point where
we were like, let's just try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just throw some plants in the woods
and let's just give it a go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had some, you know, I don't even
honestly probably didn't even know what it
[SPEAKER_03]: was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was bag seed from fish tour of some
sort.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at some point I got onto probably
ICMAG was the first forum where I reached
[SPEAKER_03]: out like I spent a lot of time lurking on
early overgrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a computer in our house in like the
late 80s.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like I saw the entirety of the Internet
bloom and blossom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as, you know, overgrow became a
thing and then got shut down, I did a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of lurking.
[SPEAKER_03]: There, you know, probably picked up my
first BHO tech there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tons of, you know, sub cool super soil
stuff and, you know, stuff that honest to
[SPEAKER_03]: God was was so valuable and just teaching
me because back then I felt like everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't an expert.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been my big beef with like forums
for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just experts telling experts how to
be experts now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's ever just like I'm learning
something like I'm here to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it is just everybody wants a boss
and say, no, that's not right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're absolutely wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for a long time, I just lurked on
these forums and sucked up as much as I
[SPEAKER_03]: could.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it was around ICMAG probably
in the early 2000s, 2000, 2001,
[SPEAKER_03]: 2002 that I finally reached out and was
just like, hey, look, I got these seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: that I've kind of played around with on my
own and I can trade them for something
[SPEAKER_03]: else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I started trading with people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was probably the very beginnings
of just getting my hands on stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, some of my favorite stuff from back
then, there was a Hayes number one cross
[SPEAKER_03]: cut that came around or a flower that came
around really heavily.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was through one of my good buddies that
was super unique and really gave me like
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of the essence of what Hayes was.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so little Hayes these days that
like it was it was one of those like
[SPEAKER_03]: perfect, very typical samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as stuff that I grew early on that
I absolutely loved, I had a double purple
[SPEAKER_03]: Doja mental floss from a cat called like
outlaw grower, outlaw breeder,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe from the seed bay days that I fell
in love with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Deep chunk is one of the first strains
that like really hooked me, got me into
[SPEAKER_03]: Kush, got me really into like heavy
medicinal mercy and heavy strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I run a deep Congo, which was
another odd, beautiful Sativa Indica
[SPEAKER_03]: pairing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one that I got from across from a
friend online, but to just, it was my
[SPEAKER_03]: first forays into kind of digging into
what's out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That really wasn't until probably 2010 and
later that I really had a super access to
[SPEAKER_03]: just anything, and really got a full taste
of everything that was out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spending years in Colorado, just with
access to every dispensary and everything
[SPEAKER_03]: you could have access to, working in tons
of commercial facilities, running most of
[SPEAKER_03]: the gear that they ran.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you work in a facility, cuts tend to
make it into everybody's growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're all growing whatever the grow
grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so through that, man, I had finally
access to just all of the flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was literally like a kid in a candy
store, because I finally had, for so many
[SPEAKER_03]: years, it was just whatever came by.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you might get weed from your
buddy, or he might have two different
[SPEAKER_03]: kinds.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were like me, you were on tour,
you might rent into four or five people
[SPEAKER_03]: with a couple, but it was kind of uncommon
to get a selection, you know, to get eight
[SPEAKER_03]: or 10 different kinds of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of them be unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't really until I started
growing my own heavily and getting access
[SPEAKER_03]: to other seeds and just popping whatever I
could get my hands on, that I finally got
[SPEAKER_03]: to that point where I'm like, I still
don't think I know everything that's
[SPEAKER_03]: there, but I have a much better
understanding now of the possibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because so many of those earlier
strains, like I said, were so one note,
[SPEAKER_03]: that now we're seeing these beautiful
combinations of different things and
[SPEAKER_03]: different flavors in different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just unprecedented.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when did the switch occur between
growing and deciding I'm going to breed my
[SPEAKER_01]: first plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't they weren't far behind,
but back then it was purely necessity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it wasn't with the air of I'm going
to one day be selling seeds, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I had that sort of foresight
because it really it wasn't until maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: 2015, 2016 that I really went at breeding
as a full time thing and as a as a passion
[SPEAKER_03]: and as something that, you know,
I wanted to work on wholeheartedly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd always just been a grower and I bred
in little small projects on my own,
[SPEAKER_03]: largely because, like I said, it was two
strains that I loved or it was something I
[SPEAKER_03]: knew I was going to lose for some reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't keep up with had to shut a
growth, you know, whatever the situation
[SPEAKER_03]: was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was back then it was more of
just a necessity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have access to all the genetics
that I have access to today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was just kind of one of those
things where if I had two strains that I
[SPEAKER_03]: loved, I'd breed them together so that,
you know, I had something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I started breeding full time,
I had some of these projects that I had
[SPEAKER_03]: worked on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to be honest, it wasn't ever at that
point with an eye towards I have a goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I want to breed a strain with flavor
or I have, you know, it was almost always
[SPEAKER_03]: just two strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love both these strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make another strain that's,
you know, a cross of these and keep them
[SPEAKER_03]: around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if I had access to F1, you know,
enough seeds, I'd do an F2.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, back then, especially when it
was just, you know, stuff that I had
[SPEAKER_03]: gotten off of forums or stuff that I had
worked with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just here and there, those were just I
wanted to try other stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I didn't have this great access.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm from the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had whatever came by, you know,
we generally lived in a bubble and didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: really have until, you know, like I said,
maybe early 2000s finally had access to
[SPEAKER_03]: just other stuff that we could get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe know a buddy that had a cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ran a couple of I got I got spider mites
twice for the same purple Kush cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to be honest with you, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd fight mites again to get her back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets one of the few that like got away
that I don't know if I've seen in the
[SPEAKER_03]: exact same condition since the last time I
saw her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I can get you one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That kid gave me mites twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I knew I knew the second time I was
going to get them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, I got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I will like everybody knows I grew up a
farm kid, but not a lot of people know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also grew up, you know, involved in a
motorcycle community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say, well, shout out names.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I still know a group of bikers to this
day that have the purple Kush and like
[SPEAKER_01]: because it had unmistakable leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was a defining trait of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one day one of them paid or he just
grew plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he got clones every year from
his buddies and he just grew them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, can you come over here and
kind of like show me how you're he won?
[SPEAKER_01]: He was an old school grower that never
really done anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, just water his plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he saw some of the things that I was
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, can you come over and kind of
show me how to like strip them and like
[SPEAKER_01]: defoliate them a little bit where I'm
going to get my bud production where I
[SPEAKER_01]: want it to be like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he started shouting out some different
stuff, you know, and this a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was like some Jack crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember all what he had,
but it wasn't all like super old stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then right at the end of his garden,
he goes, oh, and I got a purple Kush over
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was even being a smart ass then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, yeah, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I walk over the clone and I see it and
I see that long middle leaf, that slender
[SPEAKER_01]: pointed shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, that's fucking purple
Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, well, I hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guys have been fucking growing this for
like how many decades now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the first time I got that grew at
one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just strictly production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I fell in love with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I fell in love with it afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the plant as is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a commercial producer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's not one that you're just going
to, you know, grow shitloads of weed of.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's it's very typical.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one of those that when you see
it, you know it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss her so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the only one that got away.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the only one.
[SPEAKER_03]: People ask me all the time about like what
strain of all the strains that you had.
[SPEAKER_03]: What strain would you you know,
is there one you always wanted?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: She never came back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see if I can get a hold of that one
and I'll keep you in the loop with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The magician wants to know, why don't you
have pictures of your stuff on your
[SPEAKER_01]: website?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have been through three PayPal
accounts, two Venmo accounts, a cash app
[SPEAKER_03]: account and three credit card processors.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, anybody that's tried to get a credit
card processor in the last couple of years
[SPEAKER_03]: will tell you that the you that are
legitimate credit card processors that
[SPEAKER_03]: will even have a conversation with you if
you're a seed vendor are very particular
[SPEAKER_03]: about what you can put.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we originally were going to do was
put pictures of all the strains,
[SPEAKER_03]: put descriptions, put, you know,
if we could get to see contents and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when we signed up for this most
recent credit card processor, we had to go
[SPEAKER_03]: through the underwriting process,
which is normal of any proper banking
[SPEAKER_03]: situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were pretty much like,
look, the less info you put on there,
[SPEAKER_03]: the better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And nothing about like THC percentages,
content, terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we're working on doing and once
again, anybody that's followed me for a
[SPEAKER_03]: while now knows I'm on my fourth Instagram
page.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've lost about 60,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've probably lost 15,000 pictures of my
of my strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put eight years into my first page and
it got shut down with 30,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Broke my heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we decided to do was to start
redistributing all of our advertising of
[SPEAKER_03]: all kinds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now what I'm doing is all the weed
pictures are on my subreddit, which is r
[SPEAKER_03]: slash terpene genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I do still have is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I get more pictures, we're leaving
them there now instead of Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that when they get taken down,
I don't lose years of my work.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's my fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's my fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when you do everything, when you do
it all yourself, you kind of get into
[SPEAKER_03]: this, like it's easier to just have one
social media page.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can just, so I can just do
everything, you know, in one place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't necessarily have to have six
different pages.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like you said with discord,
there's a really healthy community on my
[SPEAKER_03]: discord now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, those guys share tons of
pictures of my work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, I kind of am completely hands
off with it in a sense that like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not over moderating it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not like telling people, if you have a
problem with my gear, please go tell
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody like, tell me, you know,
I've always said, if you have a problem
[SPEAKER_03]: with my gear, I'll replace it happily.
[SPEAKER_03]: You tell me what your issue is.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, seeds are living things and it
happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the reason I don't have any pictures
on my Instagram page now is because I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: tired of getting them shut down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really kind of sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sick of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm not putting any more weed
pictures on Instagram for the time being
[SPEAKER_03]: until we can figure out how they can stay
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about on your discord?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, discord.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, discord.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything goes there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's one of those things that
like, I need to start getting more active
[SPEAKER_03]: and like posting there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also don't want it to be one of
those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really weird about the self promotion
shit, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe I'm just old school.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of joked that as soon as they're
dead air, I start plugging.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, that's something I had to teach
myself to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not something that like comes
supernaturally to me of like, I just need
[SPEAKER_03]: to I want everybody to see everything I'm
doing 24 seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, once I get into a habit of
this is where I'm sharing weed pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I forget there's six other places I
need to go post that same picture,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of tough, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I do have other things going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I do weed out of life my day,
but like, I do try to have some semblance
[SPEAKER_03]: of a life as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's like, one day, I'll pay
somebody to handle all of that social
[SPEAKER_03]: media, YouTube, run my podcast,
like, we're just not there yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of us are bootstrapping
our, our, our, our businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of us started with absolutely
nothing and have built names and brands
[SPEAKER_03]: that people recognize to some degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that just comes from being persistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've put hundreds, how long have you been
public with Terp Fiend genetics?
[SPEAKER_03]: 17.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: 16, 2016.
[SPEAKER_03]: Terp Fiend genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2016 was when it became like full time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was after a few years of in the
commercial industry, doing a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to, I won the first ever Roslyn
competition with a, with a hash company.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I worked in a bunch of large
commercial grows, did it on my own for 18
[SPEAKER_03]: years on the other side of the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was really 2015 was probably the
beginning of me starting a social media
[SPEAKER_03]: page, the original Terp Fiend page.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's now long defunct and reset.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did that until 2020 when they shut
the first one down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like six years or something like
that, that I had built that first page.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after that, like I started doing
the grow cast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jordan is an absolutely awesome dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was one of those people that like,
when they shut down my Instagram leveled
[SPEAKER_03]: with me and was like, you shouldn't have
relied on them so heavily.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't like that, but that was exactly
the point was he was essentially saying
[SPEAKER_03]: like, get a website, diversify,
make sure you've got, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: all this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing back to the original
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I remember what started all this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are also trying to get my strains put
up onto seed finder.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've, we just did a huge batch of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a few strains at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: So getting them all logged in and all of
that into seed finder has been a chore.
[SPEAKER_03]: The goal is eventually to have that be
more of a repository for the actual data
[SPEAKER_03]: of like photos and terpene per cannabinoid
percentages and whatever other
[SPEAKER_03]: extemporaneous data we can put together.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once again, man, it's being a one man
show, it's like my wife helps me a lot and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's the two of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's, you know, I don't,
I don't have a team.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a bunch of people that do
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we knock out everything that has
to get done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one of those things that it's a
passion for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I didn't, I probably would have given
up ages ago because there's, there's so
[SPEAKER_03]: much that's not dealing with plants in
this business.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the tough part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if my worst problem in a day is plant
related, it was a good day, but it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, most, most days it's dealing
with somebody who's pissed off or somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: who's angry about something or,
you know, and it's, it's one of those
[SPEAKER_03]: things that that's the part of the
business that I understand why so many
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders dump their gear onto seed banks
and just say, I'm not going to handle it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the breeders that go above and beyond
to have that connection with their,
[SPEAKER_03]: their, their, the people that are growing
their strains, not only is it rare,
[SPEAKER_03]: but those are the ones that you should
support because those are the people that
[SPEAKER_03]: love what they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not just a face, a brand with no
face.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not just a marketing team
that's running at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's somebody who loves what they do and
who's passionate about what they're
[SPEAKER_03]: producing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And nine times out of 10, these social
media companies don't want us advertising
[SPEAKER_03]: without paying them large amounts of
advertising money.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really the big difference
between, you know, your big brands and you
[SPEAKER_03]: or I is it they probably have a $10,000 a
month marketing budget that they're
[SPEAKER_03]: putting straight into Instagram's pockets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas if you're not paying them ad
revenue, they look at it as a burden that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're making money without giving them
their fair cut, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I remember you saying you had a,
was it Sorbet?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just dropped a Sorbet line.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just did another Sorbet line.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be the last one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working with this line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, eventually I'm going to go back and
work with some more of the original F1s
[SPEAKER_03]: and just see what else is in that line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the Sorbet line that I've had now has
been worked with by a handful of other
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an aficionado strain I found and
worked with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see him working with it having,
we've worked with it a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, Leo's told a few people that
the cut that we worked with was better
[SPEAKER_03]: than anything he had ever seen from those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I know Mantis worked with it at some
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, leapfrog genetics has worked with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: A bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so it's, I did, I did what I
needed with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I want to go back and see what else is
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my next line, I've noticed that,
you know, once again, in these
[SPEAKER_03]: conversations that we're having somewhat
repeatedly, I don't have enough poopings.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to go back and we're going
to dig in some, just some rancid rotten,
[SPEAKER_03]: just poop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to see what we can find.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, I hear the people when they
speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, I've never been one of those people
that, you know, isn't a part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: community.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked to growers all day long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, anybody that has a question,
a grow question, a breeding question,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it's about my genetics or
otherwise, I try to answer them all
[SPEAKER_03]: because I remember being a young cat who
didn't have access to, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the resources that we have today or being
overwhelmed with the information that was
[SPEAKER_03]: out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not having anybody that I trusted that
I could go, Hey man, how does this work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what's your, you know, what's your,
what's your opinion?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I answer all of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: I answer every question I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hear people, I hear, you know,
we don't have these conversations in a
[SPEAKER_03]: vacuum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I hear you talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: People want nasty, funky, poopy,
gassy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have a problem with like,
I will, I have a tendency to run fruity
[SPEAKER_03]: profiles just because I find that like,
as far as the diversity in that,
[SPEAKER_03]: I found there's, there's just so much
there of like the different ways that kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of mimics other fruity profiles that we
associate with, but yet in its complexity
[SPEAKER_03]: of how it, you know, it can taste,
it can, a single strain can smell like
[SPEAKER_03]: five or six different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just go, yeah, that's,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I find in the fruity kind of
category, there's a lot just to dig there,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you know, I definitely listen to
people and when they say like,
[SPEAKER_03]: we want the funk, I'm like, we got to have
that funk done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, let's see what we can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's add that on my soundboard right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, let's dig, let's dig in there
and see what we can find.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll meet you on the, I'll meet you in
the support group, I guess, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So next it's poop beans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, five year, man, not really to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hear more about the Sorbet line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Sorbet line.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's funny about the Sorbet,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: From the minute I started working with it,
everybody that messed with any of the F1s
[SPEAKER_03]: that messed with any of the F2s,
any of the crosses that we did of it has
[SPEAKER_03]: told me it's one of the most complex
strains they've ever worked with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when, when I first ran the original,
um, so it's got, it's, I named one of the,
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the crosses that I did with the
Sorbet, I named Nag Champa, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody asked me, does it smell like
the incense?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but it reminds me, there is a lot of
incense there, like incense kind of turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing that I love about it is it's
so complex that it reminds you of incense
[SPEAKER_03]: in that there's so much going on,
but you can't almost can't point to say,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, it reminds me of that, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's one of those strains that the more
you smoke it, you just want to hit it
[SPEAKER_03]: again, just so you can pull that flavor
and try and put it together of what that
[SPEAKER_03]: note is that you're tasting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the pineapple sorbet that I originally
worked with, it has a lot of candy
[SPEAKER_03]: pineapple, but it has this like incense on
the beach type of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We almost get like a coconutty,
uh, lots of fruit, you know, just assorted
[SPEAKER_03]: fruit type of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also got this, I always say it
reminds me of like rum punches on the
[SPEAKER_03]: beach.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all of the tropical,
it just goes with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a level of unique that I,
you know, I had to work with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the thing that I found is that
anything you hit with it kind of takes
[SPEAKER_03]: this even amount of this overly complex
fruity, insensi thing, and then kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: marries that with the weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of like with the,
with the pineapple meatball that somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: was asking about earlier, you know,
I never thought meat breath, and pineapple
[SPEAKER_03]: sorbet would work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when I put it together, it was one of
those strains that I was just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is weird, but I'm going to throw it
and see how it happens, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been one of the top four strains
of mine that people have resonated with
[SPEAKER_03]: the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it washes well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's a hasher.
[SPEAKER_03]: The profile is super strange and unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just, it's a, it's a box
checker.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so, speaking of growing your genetics,
I said, I hadn't grown your genetics yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I had wanted to for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've been watching it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, you know, I've had so much shit
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really haven't had the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you mentioned leap frog genetics
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both good friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and they sent me a bunch of feeds that
they did from your work of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the ones that I really
wanted to grow out, see what they were
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked really, really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then the other one that I didn't
have seeds of was the orange head rush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you still do those?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to get back to the,
that's, those ended up being some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: heaviest yielding strains that I've made.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those, uh, the 501st OG deep chunk,
the ones I called the head rush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are actually from eclectic elegant
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think he ended up, what's funny was
I were, he gave me those way back when I
[SPEAKER_03]: asked him if I could work with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made some seeds of my own and just one
of those where I put some stuff together
[SPEAKER_03]: and I needed a name.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then later down the road, he does his
own thing with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, and probably still sells them
amazing seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but those ended up being some of the
chunkiest crosses that I worked with,
[SPEAKER_03]: like out of everything that I've worked
with so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so, yeah, I'm going to get back to
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always joke that like my goal has always
been to get people to smoke more Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, if you kind of look at through
80, 85% of the work that I've done,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's kind of a prevailing theme.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just, if I could get people to
smoke more Mersenne Kush, Mersenne heavy
[SPEAKER_03]: Kush, I think we'd all get a little
higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that now the counter to that is that
most of the poopings, I feel like most of
[SPEAKER_03]: the heavy poopings, most of the funkiest
profiles tend to be Southeast Asian in
[SPEAKER_03]: origin, um, tend to be kind of more sativa
cleaning strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to say there's not that in the,
you know, in the, in the Indica profiles
[SPEAKER_03]: as well, but I feel like a lot of what we
associate with these days is like the GMOs
[SPEAKER_03]: and the chem fours and the, you know,
the really stinky, stinky stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of those are Southeast Asian
strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're mostly sativa strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how they take 11 and a half weeks and
they're still not done.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's why at 11 weeks,
they're really starting to put on their
[SPEAKER_03]: true show, you know, like they're just not
strains that not great strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: The growing doors, you know, most of them
will have some hermaphroditic tendencies.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you, if you stress them a little much,
you know, but that's where we get all
[SPEAKER_03]: those like awesome stinky yucky profiles
from, you know, is those old school ties,
[SPEAKER_03]: those old school Vietnamese strains,
uh, the Cambodian, you know, there's
[SPEAKER_03]: Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those strains are devastating too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they are really heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for somebody who doesn't have a super
tolerance, like there's a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: like, they can be overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking put you on your ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I, that's what really got me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's why it's shout out the
breeders that I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interested in working with some of
your gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I do work with dynasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been work with solo, uh, and solo
does a lot of, you know, like modern short
[SPEAKER_01]: week, heavy Terp stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I think it's important to take
these, this modern, modern cannabis that
[SPEAKER_01]: we have now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the people that are willing to do
the work to go back to those, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: old ties and stuff like that and find that
one that's stable, find that one that is
[SPEAKER_01]: unique, which might be one in 1000,
you know, uh, but still taking the time to
[SPEAKER_01]: do that and work it back into modern
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can kind of open up that,
that genetic profile again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the problems that we're having
right now with that, with the numbers game
[SPEAKER_03]: there, um, I don't know how many people I
could tell you said, man, I found these,
[SPEAKER_03]: my dad, my dad gave me these strains,
these seeds, but dad gave me these seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to start a skunk project.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm about to pop all.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave me bags of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to start a skunk project.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to resurrect skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then everybody runs into the same
problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeds that are older than 95 are probably
going to have less than a 1% germ rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're talking about strains that are
20 seeds that are 20 plus years old,
[SPEAKER_03]: the other thing is the 70s specifically
70s, 80s, where a lot of those strains,
[SPEAKER_03]: those old school strains that people
remember, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The skunk and the, you know, the original
lineages of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So unless somebody's sitting on cuts of
that, any seeds that might be from that
[SPEAKER_03]: era are long since worthless.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we really get into like a, if you're
talking about bringing stuff back from old
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, you better have hundreds of
thousands of seeds to be able to start
[SPEAKER_03]: with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can just get a couple of plants
that work, you know, but if we're talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about something where people are going and
finding land race genetics and finding
[SPEAKER_03]: these, you know, small untouched areas
where there's or, or lineage, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, legacy genetics, where people have
actually been breeding these particular
[SPEAKER_03]: strains and they're not overly hybridized
with American stuff or Dutch stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's what we need.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we need to grab as much of that as we
have access to as the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just so that that's the sort of stuff
we can still be infusing in once
[SPEAKER_03]: inevitably modern genetics get all over
the planet, there's still only a few
[SPEAKER_03]: places in the world where you can find
seeds that aren't just, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Dutch, old Dutch strains, or that aren't
just, you know, modern American strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, you know, that's the beautiful
part about those people that are still
[SPEAKER_03]: going out there, still hunting stuff down
in these little pockets of the world,
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's where the I don't know is
going to come from.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to be from overly banging
together stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We already know what it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be going back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that we have the analytics now that we
have the capabilities to do testing,
[SPEAKER_03]: to go back and find in these, you know,
somewhat older genetics, old world style
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics, not old seeds, um, that we're
finally going to see, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: what else is out there that we don't know
about yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got, you gave us a bunch of seeds to
give away to our Patreon members.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be doing an episode of do
or dab tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you have any time,
but if you want to come in and see your
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, be given away during a game show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two new members coming on right on
and taco with acts to go head to head on
[SPEAKER_01]: do or dab, which is like a game where we
have two players that go through a game
[SPEAKER_01]: board, uh, random selection style.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get a number.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might say, do a one gram dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might sing, say something like sing
Bohemian rhapsody for 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so they get questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they go head to head at the end of the
game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's super high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody had a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the winner gets to pick a pack of
seeds from you while the other one gets a
[SPEAKER_01]: random pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what time?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be about the same time,
about 5 PM.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I got a nine tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing another, I got a podcast
tomorrow evening at nine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we do two and as much as I hate
Instagram at this point, I'm just,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's where my following is at the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm doing two podcasts a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we do dank talk on Wednesdays with me
and the real Mac blunts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on Saturdays I do the OG sesh,
um, which is usually just me and another
[SPEAKER_03]: it's, it's this, it's this, it's usually
me and another grower, another breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just in an hour we sit and we shoot
the shit off the cuff and it's all off the
[SPEAKER_03]: top of the head.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really just the conversations
that so many of us have when it's just us
[SPEAKER_03]: growers or just us breeders or,
you know, the industry people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And your average listener probably doesn't
hear so much of this kind of stuff where
[SPEAKER_03]: these are the kinds of just conversations
that we have so often when we're just
[SPEAKER_03]: sitting around and just, you know,
puffing, whether it's about grow styles or
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it's about, you know, it's the
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, there's so much that I love
about what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't ever think that it's 90% of my
day is just talking weed with people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I just figured I might as well
stick a camera in my face and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, let somebody else listen to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it works, you know, what I love
about it is I always enjoyed getting with
[SPEAKER_01]: the homies sitting on the couch,
smoking weed, letting the conversation go
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and now with, you know, all of this
technology that we're using right now to
[SPEAKER_01]: connect with people all over the world
that do all these different niches within
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get no more pleasure than getting to
meet new faces and find out those people
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've lived with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking cool, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a gigantic, constant going cannabis
event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like speed dating.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's even better because so many of the
cannabis events have either gotten shut
[SPEAKER_03]: down or wrapped up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not what they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't even even have Seattle Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were talking about doing it this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go on the, that was the biggest
event.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the biggest events in the
United States, you know, Seattle Hempfest.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of the older ones too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say that the hash bash,
um, in Ann Arbor, I think were two of the
[SPEAKER_03]: ones I remember way back in the day
reading about in high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go on the website, even this
year, it's like not confirmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were talking about doing the event
and who knows, you know, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: there was a long history there of cups and
them being really awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was a point, a lot of it
had to do with the legalization end of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That when it was kind of in a gray area in
some of these places, then it was one
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now that it's legal and everything
needs to be within a very specific
[SPEAKER_03]: framework of you have to buy the weed and
dispensaries and you can't just open smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: and all of, a lot of things change.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they quit doing the Denver cups
on 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like those were some of the biggest events
on the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you would have 30,000 people a day
by three days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just, you know, it was,
it was open season.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was literally like, we did a few Cali
cups where you, especially there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of chalice, the first couple of
chalices where you could just walk up and
[SPEAKER_03]: purchase slabs on people's tables.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just walk up and buy pounds,
you know, and it was that, that all ended
[SPEAKER_03]: 15, 16, and you just, it's just not the
same without the vendors and without being
[SPEAKER_03]: able to show off and bring whatever you
want and you know, it's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't have the time like I used
to to do shows anymore because I've got so
[SPEAKER_01]: much of my own stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you still participate in shows quite
often?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, man, I did a few, I did a couple
runs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, it just came down to A, it's an
expensive lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_03]: B, doesn't always pay off.
[SPEAKER_03]: C, once again, I grew up on music lots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just a holdover.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the exact same, same thing in a
different parking lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just people hustling in a parking
lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, now it's not quite as
open season.
[SPEAKER_03]: So whatever you're selling, it's just not
as easy to make as much money on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never really had a passion for this,
the weed circuit.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some people that were just made
for it and it was, I always looked at it
[SPEAKER_03]: just like a concert if they weren't doing
shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would just be doing weed events and
they would go to city to city to city to
[SPEAKER_03]: city and you'd see the same people on the
lot every single time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same people paid for the big booth,
same people are in the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was, you know, and it's all
politics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, I got other things to do than
travel around the country smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if I can drop into a cup every
now and again, it's still a fun time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's, it hasn't, there's just this era
of like, it's not the same, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of it has changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: There really is no big cups anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there used to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now so much of it is like,
everybody's desperately trying to vie for
[SPEAKER_03]: the same amount of dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas when you make your money online,
it's just how many people can you get in
[SPEAKER_03]: front of?
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas if you're making your money in a
parking lot, it's how many people showed
[SPEAKER_03]: up today.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't control that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a little bit of when you have
to pay money to go do those shows,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have to pay money for advertising.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to pay money for banners to pay
money for entries.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're entering the cup, you have to,
you know, and it's just, it stopped being
[SPEAKER_03]: fun or profitable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think for a lot of people,
once they had access to the internet in a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit better way, so many people were
hitting, you know, Instagram for a long
[SPEAKER_03]: time and just crushing it that yeah,
it didn't make sense to go fly,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially post pandemic, how much flying
you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, you just want to spend
your whole time in an airplane and then a
[SPEAKER_03]: hotel for not a whole lot of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a McDonald's job and make more
money than you're going to make touring
[SPEAKER_03]: around the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just, it's a little bit of like,
I've always appreciated being the kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: breeder that like people find me and when
they find me, they love what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they end up finding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not one of those things where you
saw me in a magazine or you saw me at a
[SPEAKER_03]: hype event and then you got stuff home and
then it's super expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you run it and you kind of go,
I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like the people have always
found me and despite the fact that
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram keeps shutting us down,
it doesn't really affect much because now
[SPEAKER_03]: we spread out so much and the people that
find us are almost always word of mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost always a friend of a friend
told me you had something that was
[SPEAKER_03]: different than everybody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, that's why I try to keep
something for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to keep a flavor for every palette.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, I'm my pickiest
critic, whether it's my grow, whether
[SPEAKER_03]: it's, you know, my seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I see something and it impresses me,
I usually assume that's the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and generally speaking, when I show
that to other people, regardless of it's
[SPEAKER_03]: my own work or something, I'm running from
somebody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I usually say this is shocking,
try this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's usually something that other
people are going to pick up on and go,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, that's that's something special.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a good one, a good, a good,
for instance, was the blackout truffle,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the blackout truffle was a cut that I
got from a dispensary I was working at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I left, the veg manager hit me up
and was just like, hey, if there's
[SPEAKER_03]: anything you want, let me know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had this biochem cut from 303 seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a chem four sensei star.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is probably one of the strongest
single cuts that I've that I've worked
[SPEAKER_03]: with, like it's tests high and it's got a
ton of turps, which is super rare.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we cross that to the white cherry
truffle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And which is another chem heavy,
you know, chem cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is it's just that's the one that
I've had people come to me and go,
[SPEAKER_03]: my customers are scared of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, you need better customers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But beside the point, like it's I think
people think it's a marketing thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've had multiple people come to me
and be like, it's too strong for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't like I can't run it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't everybody that I give it to it's
too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one of those that for me,
I've seen tests on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most tests of the cross aren't in the 30
range.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mom was a dispensary cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it regularly tested in the 30s at
dispose like no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the crosses have all been kind of high
to mid 20s.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just lots of mercy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once again, that's that kind of
combination that just makes everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: knock out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's it's almost like a cheat code.
[SPEAKER_03]: Heavy mercy levels is almost like the
cheat code to high potency because most
[SPEAKER_03]: people can't tell the difference between
high THC and something just makes them so
[SPEAKER_03]: body high they're ready to pass out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's that's what high is to so many
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you just smoke sativas and just
literally wig out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's generally when people go,
it was too strong for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost always because it made them go
to sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: It knocked you just off your ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that tends to be those heavy mercy and
strains, whether they're super high THC or
[SPEAKER_03]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of everything that you've made,
what would you say would be the number one
[SPEAKER_01]: strain strain at this moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where if you were gone tomorrow,
you would want that to represent the work
[SPEAKER_01]: that you've done with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blackout truffle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blackout truffle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hands down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's strains and I think
there's strains that I've made that have
[SPEAKER_03]: been more popular, like that other people
would probably argue with me about like
[SPEAKER_03]: the noctua is one that, you know,
so many people have come and told me at
[SPEAKER_03]: the beginning that it's I tell people it's
special and I think people think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: marketing hype.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would probably be the very close
number to the noctua is a special,
[SPEAKER_03]: special plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the blackout truffle for me is a level
of medicinal that like it's that cut
[SPEAKER_03]: through plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that one that like when I got jars of
everything around when I hit the blackout
[SPEAKER_03]: truffle and even if it's from a friend who
doesn't know what they're doing and they
[SPEAKER_03]: beat their plants up and they were
struggle looking and they didn't get a
[SPEAKER_03]: good feed on it, it's still the gorgeous
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still the one that just wows
everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it's the profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got everything that the chem line
has, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a heavy mothball spoiled Thai
food thing going on, but it doesn't take
[SPEAKER_03]: 11 weeks to finish.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost always finished in like eight
to 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's heavy like it's like I said,
it's the one that I've had other people
[SPEAKER_03]: tell me their customers don't want because
it's too strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had other growers tell me they had to
cut back on running it because it was just
[SPEAKER_03]: too much for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like for me, with tolerance issues,
it's the one that like if you ask me the
[SPEAKER_03]: desert island question, because that's the
other one that I get like on a lot on the
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, when I'm talking to maybe non
non breeder people, it's always the like
[SPEAKER_03]: what's your strain, three strains that
you'd live on a desert island with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would have to be that would have
to be number one for me because every time
[SPEAKER_03]: I have something else and I go back to
that one, it's the one that always works.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like I build tolerance really
quickly to strains, most of them depending
[SPEAKER_03]: on turf profiles and certain other things,
you know, most of them I'll build a
[SPEAKER_03]: tolerance to within a couple days of just
puffing it regularly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the one that like, it just
always kind of kicks you where you need
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, it's almost the one where
you have to go it has a special place like
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't a little too much in the middle of
the day will still get you, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, I might have to go have a lay down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that that's that's that's that's the
one that I think if you asked me the
[SPEAKER_03]: strain that I think represents,
you know, my favorite of the work that
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done, it would be the blackout
truffle.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Nag Tampa is a second is a close
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if I asked you the same question,
but about somebody's genetics other than
[SPEAKER_01]: your own?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask me the question again.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the what was the whole of the
question, just so I'm specific?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were on a desert island,
you could only take one strain with you
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's not your own work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to be somebody else's work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, I got to go back to that purple kush
cut, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I got to go back to that purple
kush, just because it's the one that got
[SPEAKER_03]: away.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the one that I haven't had in so
long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the one of the you know,
once you have a strain like it's in your
[SPEAKER_03]: grow, and you can run it as much as you
want, and you can fill jars up with it,
[SPEAKER_03]: then it's easy to get over it real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like the even the most amazing
looking strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once I can grow it for myself,
and I can just fill a whole room of it if
[SPEAKER_03]: I want, then it's kind of like,
I don't know, you kind of get a little
[SPEAKER_03]: jaded on it, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like the stuff that I've had
access to throughout my my history of
[SPEAKER_03]: growing is always the stuff that I'd be
like, if it just never came around again,
[SPEAKER_03]: it'd be okay, you know, even the best
stuff that I've ever grown a run.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, you just kind of
go, but if I had jars of it at one point,
[SPEAKER_03]: then, you know, there's other stuff out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that the ones that got away,
the ones that you didn't really get as
[SPEAKER_03]: much as you wanted, the ones that you
didn't really get your fill of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you didn't get sick of,
those are the ones for me that I think,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I'm gonna be stuck on a desert
island, man, I really want something that
[SPEAKER_03]: got away something, something that reminds
me of the day, you know, do you keep cuts
[SPEAKER_01]: very much?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you strictly work from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but mostly, once again, it's mostly
like the legacy stuff that I've that I
[SPEAKER_03]: really love, like the nonchalant stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which ones stuck around the longest?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nonchalant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of somebody else's work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, of somebody else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's tough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't keep, man, I don't I don't
keep I just don't like I just don't I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't covet cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I had earlier because when I was
working in commercial dispensaries really
[SPEAKER_03]: heavily, like I had access to so much
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was so much stuff, the sour
diesel deep chunk that we used to run
[SPEAKER_03]: orange ghosts from obsolete from back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an Orange Legends OG cut that he
put out that they used to have a Tigers
[SPEAKER_03]: milk cut that was just stupid,
stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, it's it's I wish I wish I
had a thought earlier on, like this is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be full time for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do nothing but seeds and
genetics, because there were so many
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics that went through my hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the time, I was just running
flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was just running grows of
flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it made sense to just, you know,
run a tray of it, run a couple trays of it
[SPEAKER_03]: till you're sick and run something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other people's stuff, that double purple
dosing mental floss got away from me back
[SPEAKER_03]: in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's what's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a big sativa guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more leaning on the sativa side.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as a hash maker was the first strain I
ever saw that had purple trichomes,
[SPEAKER_03]: which made purple sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the first time I sifted it,
and I was looking like I had done
[SPEAKER_03]: something wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it doesn't even look purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, the first time you sift purple
trikes, it looks gray.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you're used to seeing like white,
and like crystaly white, it's a weird
[SPEAKER_03]: thing the first time you see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So eventually I get the scope out,
you know, and I'm like scoping.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see, you know, you can see the
pigment go up through the trichome stock
[SPEAKER_03]: and then fill the trichome head while
they're maturing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it all made, you know,
it was one of those early like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're just in your grow, and you don't
really realize, once again, this before
[SPEAKER_03]: the internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So super macro pictures back then were not
common.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people, they weren't everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't see these like amazing pictures
of like two trichomes, individual
[SPEAKER_03]: trichomes, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, the first time I saw that it
was a double purple Doja mental floss
[SPEAKER_03]: cross from Outlaw Grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it kind of, you know, you have these
points along your growing career where you
[SPEAKER_03]: see something new.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we all may find it on our
own.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to you, it's a new kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it pushes you that little bit more,
you know, into the minutia of growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one of those things that really,
once you've realized something on that
[SPEAKER_03]: level that you didn't know, now you just
have that thought of like, what else don't
[SPEAKER_03]: I know?
[SPEAKER_03]: What else can I learn?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what else small things am I missing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I, you know, the first time you
see purple Keef, and you're just making
[SPEAKER_03]: Keef on your own, and it doesn't look like
the rest of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just like, whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, now we've all seen a purple rosin
drip or we've all seen, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if everybody has,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some people that just I've met
through doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Patreon members from all over
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: A love of cannabis is intense,
but there's a lot of people that really
[SPEAKER_01]: don't do social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like, oh, well, I saw your podcast
and.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came on here and yeah, we grow weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love those people because they're not
jaded by all of the things that you,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe you or I are jaded by because we see
them 18 million times on the internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I made a meme that the worst headache
you can have is watching what's wrong with
[SPEAKER_03]: my plant posts on Reddit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, oh, the level of pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you do it for five minutes and just
go scrolling through and.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at what's wrong with my plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a single leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's wrong with my plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's so bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like people that don't know all
of those cliches and the things that we've
[SPEAKER_03]: all seen a million times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the best because let's be
honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: They come from a place of like we like the
cow mag love and it's a plant and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more cow mag joke is is we beat that
one to death too though.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is the funny thing about the more
cow mag joke is how apt it actually is
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's twofold, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The joke is just add more cow mag.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes everything better.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are literally people that are using
cow mag as some sort of a crutch or it's
[SPEAKER_03]: got to be an everything or you know,
and here's the funny thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Calcium and magnesium are both
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your plant doesn't need a ton of either
one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it needs them, but not in these
massive amounts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the joke is like, more micronutrients
isn't going to help your plant one iota,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's the duct tape of the weed world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something's wrong with your weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: More cow mag in two more weeks and you're
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have synthetic growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Synganic growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I do myself is no-till living
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the amount of times that I recommend
cow mag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most organic gardeners wouldn't know what
cow mag was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you see it on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you really need to get some
moisture shell or something like that in
[SPEAKER_01]: their bone meal, work it in, top dress it,
you know, that's just kind of like being
[SPEAKER_01]: aware of, you know, your soil and
reamending it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the amount of times I've needed to add
cow mag.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you probably don't own a PPHP.
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably don't own an ECPPM meter
either.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, you wouldn't need it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it came from the
commercialization of the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came from the fact that now every town
has a large scale grow store and those
[SPEAKER_03]: guys make money selling you stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you go in there and you don't
know what you need, they're going to sell
[SPEAKER_03]: you anything they can and that makes them
more money.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's why most of those nutrient
lines are broken down into 12 different
[SPEAKER_03]: bottles.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could sell you all that into two
bottles.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just can't charge you as much for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you don't really need 90% of
that stuff and then you go in there and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're like, I don't know what I need.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hook me up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I need, you know, you need cow mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk shit just because I was
the scorer at one point, but I feel like I
[SPEAKER_01]: get to talk shit about my old self here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of those bottled nutrient
companies, I feel like those balls are 90%
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not just because that's the
popular way of thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like doing I practice K&F and making
my own nutrient from my soil and I can
[SPEAKER_01]: make nutrients for my soil at a fraction
of the cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by fraction of the cost, I'm talking
about what I would have been paying with a
[SPEAKER_01]: seven part ball system for one bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing like one, two hundredth of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a trillion dollar industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And per dilution rate, I'm using way less
than what's recommended.
[SPEAKER_01]: On any bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the trick that I tell so many
new growers is like whatever you pick,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever you start with, you probably need
half of whatever has been recommended to
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like for a lot of people,
the way that you grow is very much a
[SPEAKER_03]: passion.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the sort of thing that you find at a
certain point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a very beautiful niche of the
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many people that get started the
thought of having, you know, that bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff rotting around their house to make
nutrients to dilute it is such a foreign
[SPEAKER_03]: concept that, you know, so many people go
into the grocery store and just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a bag of something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a bottle of something and I need a
light.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're lucky if that's, you know,
and that's that's pretty much the grocery
[SPEAKER_03]: store is like, oh, we got you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got six or seven bottles for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got fans.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to believe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got and it's a trillion dollar
everything you need.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a trillion dollar industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: If not more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's so much just snakery in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like it's overwhelming now
because when you go into a lot of these
[SPEAKER_03]: huge grow shops, there's so much stuff
that even as a seasoned grower,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's it's shocking at first because you're
just like, good Lord, I've seen all of
[SPEAKER_03]: this and I've never seen half of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like you guys got stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I always joked about the in the
late 90s, early 2000s, there was always
[SPEAKER_03]: this was like a lamp mover, but it was
essentially like a bladed fan with like 15
[SPEAKER_03]: blades and they just had like screwed in
HID bulbs and it would spin just like a
[SPEAKER_03]: like a fan would.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I never saw anybody buy them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for more than a decade, every time I
went into the grow shop, they had them on
[SPEAKER_03]: display.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would always think to myself like,
it's the same amount of light.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going in a circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's not like a proper light mover
where it's moving, you know, four feet
[SPEAKER_03]: away and you're covering more canopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the most useless tool I could ever
think of.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were probably hundreds, if not more
dollars each.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guarantee you, there's somebody out
there running one of them things still
[SPEAKER_03]: today, you know, and swears it's gotten
them increased yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like, there's so much junk.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much just foolery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, there's more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, almost like the as seen on TV level.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, cheesy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, they make money selling you
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They make money selling you stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, don't listen to anything those
guys say, like, figure out what you need
[SPEAKER_03]: ahead of time, figure out what your niche
is in the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you just want to grow
organics, learn about organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to grow synthetics,
learn about hydro learn about synthetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like the last person you need to
go take your grow tip advice from is the
[SPEAKER_03]: guy that makes money from your failure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a million dollars worth of game
because those guys and not to say I
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't met some awesome dudes that work
at the grow shop, but their whole business
[SPEAKER_03]: is on you needing to spend more money,
whether that's on more bottles of newts,
[SPEAKER_03]: more pots, more lights, more fans,
they make money when you have to spend.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're going to them and asking them
immediately, what do I need?
[SPEAKER_03]: You need all of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the best lights you can think of
when we're going to get you on the 12
[SPEAKER_03]: bottle system.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't even worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to use them all at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all the same shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I don't know, like as we see
more new growers and more legal states,
[SPEAKER_03]: right, there's a million new.
[SPEAKER_03]: The joke is the reason Blue Dream will
always be somebody's favorite strain is
[SPEAKER_03]: because a new state is about to go legal
soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's another couple million people
that have seen Blue Dream in high times
[SPEAKER_03]: and they heard everybody talk about Blue
Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they can finally get their hands
on this mythical, magical strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now there's a million new people
looking for a Blue Dream cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the same thing with all these,
you know, how do you feel about Blue
[SPEAKER_00]: Dream?
[SPEAKER_03]: Bless new growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, just know what you need
because there's somebody out there willing
[SPEAKER_03]: to take you for a lot more than you should
be spending to get started in a grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do I feel about Blue Dream?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about Blue Dream now that
you said that?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's funny about Blue Dream is the
only strain that I've ever seen a
[SPEAKER_03]: documented three a light.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a thousand and thousand watt bulb
grows, it's the only strain I've ever
[SPEAKER_03]: actually seen pull three a light.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't argue with why it's popular,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a beautiful strain when it grows,
huge buds, lots of resin, got kind of a
[SPEAKER_03]: generic blueberry muffin profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to get anybody out there
too high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never have to worry about that,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It will never be in my growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a long running joke that you don't
know the backstory on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to ask you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Believe me, you're not the first to have a
Blue Dream joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this joke has one more layer of comedy
to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually did start a Facebook group.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can still go find it today.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called the Closet Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Dream lovers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the joke was you can now put your
friends who talk Blue Dream up amongst
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves and have the whole argument
about why it's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can just add them to the Facebook
group, the Closet Blue Dream Lovers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still out there floating around.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's never been very active, but it's once
again, man, I'm starting up groups to
[SPEAKER_03]: bring people together that have common
interests, pooping fetishes, Blue Dream
[SPEAKER_03]: fetishes, you know, whatever it is,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here to support the bringing together
of just like minded souls and individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sounds like my group.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the now I got to know what do I
feel bad for being in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the Blue Dream joke?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's not a Blue Dream joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I still keep the Santa Cruz cut
just because I agree with everything you
[SPEAKER_01]: said.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a very generic taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is an impressive yielder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the bag appeal on it, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just a good looking bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plant structure, too, it's a
strong plant and it's really good at
[SPEAKER_01]: holding weight, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always when I started getting
interested in making seeds for myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: it wasn't that I loved Blue Dream or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like it's a strong plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a solid yielder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this something that I could increase
the potency on?
[SPEAKER_01]: And give a better flavor while still
retaining that yielder, not taking it down
[SPEAKER_01]: too much, you know, still retaining those
base traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have not bred with it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just kind of been something that
was nostalgic for me that I kind of kept
[SPEAKER_01]: around to see if I could do that one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's nostalgic for me because we used
to we have you ever heard of rad boarding?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so it's this like country boy redneck
game.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of fun, but we all go down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm from the Deep South, so try me.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so this so dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you do it and you're good at it and
you figure it out, it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially what we do is we take this
rad board and it's like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not crescent moon, not D shape,
but somewhere in between just slightly
[SPEAKER_03]: crying the truck or a bulldozer neither.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so we tie a rope to a tree and then to
that rope you tie a bungee cord and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you attach the bungee cord to the board
and you lean on the board and ride it out
[SPEAKER_01]: into the current of the river.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you lean the board back,
the current pushes back and it stretches
[SPEAKER_01]: out the bungee cord.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you get up on it and you
start to lean forward, you can surf in the
[SPEAKER_01]: river like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you like if you mess up and you
land in front of that board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's on that bungee and it loses
tension.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's scary, but it's an awesome
sport.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it quite a few times,
but I've seen people get messed up from it
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that there was this dude that used to
run it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Down here in our area and he just he grew
all kinds of blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like the only thing he ever
wanted to grow just because it was such a
[SPEAKER_01]: production plant, you know, and he could
get tons of yield back then and you could
[SPEAKER_01]: get decent money for weed, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the conversation that's it's it's
cliche at this point, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I joked we were going to do an
hour just about blue dream and we were
[SPEAKER_03]: just going to steal man on one side and
and and devil's advocate the other side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're just going to have the
conversation that you and I have probably
[SPEAKER_03]: had a hundred times by now about the one
side says it's a production strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's immune to PM.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's you know, it's got all these
beautiful traits and that's why we run it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other side goes, yeah,
but nobody's getting high on that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after about the second joint,
nobody wants to smoke it because it's kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of just a generic bland profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and the other problem is it is such a
production workhorse to so many people
[SPEAKER_03]: have beat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just cloned it and run it and
cloned it and run it and cloned it and run
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so back when I would see it heavily
like, you know, years back, it was always
[SPEAKER_03]: in the most gross amounts you could ever
see.
[SPEAKER_03]: A point where you just go, nobody wants
that amount of blue dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did you grow so much blue dream?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's not that really that they grew
that many plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just yields that well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it just throws these like super
symmetrical for sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: It yields really well, you know,
for a fairly sativa leaning plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I worked in a dispenser.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like one hundred eighty thousand
square foot indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would grow six and seven eight
foot tall blue dream buds plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would literally have arm size.
[SPEAKER_03]: Single cold is on the top of every one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, it is the only grow I've ever
seen documented yielded over three or
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, three pounds per thousand
watt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never grown that much green.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've I flower out a plant here and there
just for a nostalgic taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let let me move on to the second part
of that before everybody forgets.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about Purple Punch?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a lot more positive than I am about
blue dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's why.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's why.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's why.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this comes from a resin guy point of
view.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So blue dream does not make great hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: The funny thing about it is it's got tons
of resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't it might throw down in the wash,
but then it's got really waxy trichomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you go to press it, there's tons
of stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's tons of wax.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's tons of loss.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't make six star melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen blue dream throw down
pure, true six star amazing melt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Purple Punch is a different story.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it comes to wash, when it comes to
resin, Purple Punch is one of those
[SPEAKER_03]: strains that as a breeder, it's going to
make amazing crosses with amazing resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: The beautiful thing about Purple Punch is
that it's not that loud of a profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you can do is you take a really
turpy daddy and you hit it to a Purple
[SPEAKER_03]: Punch and now you've got something that's
worth talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like slurricane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's ever going to be like,
I got 10 jars of slurricane.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're never going to get enough of it,
but it makes amazing crosses, amazing wash
[SPEAKER_03]: crosses, amazing hash crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the beautiful thing is with both of
those strains, the resin tends to break
[SPEAKER_03]: really evenly from the trichome stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why people love to hash them
because though they're by themselves,
[SPEAKER_03]: not the most turpy profiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're great for making crosses with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's another one that I don't run a
ton, but I have made some Purple Punch
[SPEAKER_03]: crosses that were just amazing,
amazing hash strains, but I don't run
[SPEAKER_03]: either.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't run either cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is Purple Punch the blue dream of the
21st century?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the implication?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go ahead and say what hasn't been
said in this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll address the elephant in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stubborn about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I defend blue dream in those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: With you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your thoughts on Purple Punch?
[SPEAKER_01]: My thoughts on Purple Punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have nothing against Purple Punch at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I love the taste of Purple Punch,
just like I love the taste of blue dream,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's not because it's not the taste of
blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's not that it's not that it tastes
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that the turps are high on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that specific flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nostalgic for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It brings back good memories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I said I flower out a plant
of it here or there just to have a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of it just so I can reach into that
jar and roll it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was the other purpose of it,
too, was can I use this as a base to breed
[SPEAKER_01]: something special that I find with to
improve the potency, improve the flavor,
[SPEAKER_01]: take what I like about blue dream,
but make it better in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I tell you the funniest part about
this conversation with you right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that I sense a little shame in your
voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it may come because I hear it
over and over again that you know exists.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a little bit of like,
I love it, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's my shame at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's unpopular opinion,
you know, but I also have you ever bred
[SPEAKER_01]: with blue dream?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never even had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, purple punch I've had in mainly
because, well, access to a lot more like
[SPEAKER_03]: never worked with it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have access to what your favorite
thing is, which is those heavy turp like
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously you're going to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't I don't fault you at all for
having a strain that you love,
[SPEAKER_03]: even if it's an unpopular strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I think the thing about blue
dream is that has it has become a cultural
[SPEAKER_03]: thing within the head weed community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not your shame doesn't come from you
not feeling right about the fact that you
[SPEAKER_03]: love a strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm saying is there is a cultural
thing of like shame towards blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anything, the tiny amount of shame that
I felt there was because me and my buddy,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have this funny long running thing like
he'll make fun of me like, you're still
[SPEAKER_01]: you still got that blue dream,
but he's got purple punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, you're still running purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just said it first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, purple punch is one of those
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I equivalent them the same because purple
punch does not get me fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the flavor is way better on purple
punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, the resin is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a big part of its heavy
oil glandular.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a better oil to wax ratio in the
trichome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a decent yielder, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks good, but they're kind of in
that same ballpark.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, good yielder.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got their own original flavor,
even if you don't like it or you do like
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One's got a heavy yield quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one's got a heavy taste quality
and neither of them are really going to
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember sweet tooth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason I didn't like blue dream was
because it reminded me so much of sweet
[SPEAKER_03]: tooth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I ran a ton of sweet tooth in like the
late 90s, early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the profiles are so similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like this just generic sweet
is how I usually described it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like I've seen some blue.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing about most of the blue dream
flower I've seen is that the blueberry
[SPEAKER_03]: profile that is usually inherent to the
flower doesn't always transfer to the
[SPEAKER_03]: finished weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like with blue dream, a lot of the blue
dream flower that I see is just kind of a
[SPEAKER_03]: generic, you know, sweet kind of profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost rare to see one that like you
get a lot of that blueberry complexity
[SPEAKER_03]: that is there on the flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when you grow it, it smells nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just yeah, it just doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever grow the blueberry muffin?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not blueberry muffin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've run a few phenos of blueberry years
back and through the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here and there from different seed pops
from DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, but no, I do remember a strain back
in, you know, late 90s, early 2000s,
[SPEAKER_03]: that they used to call the blueberry yum
yum.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was super heavy around Atlanta.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ludacris wrote a song about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that not just blueberry?
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on who you ask and what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yes, I don't think it was an entire
really unique strain, but I'm not sure if
[SPEAKER_03]: it was a DJ Short blueberry pheno,
but it was it was one of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just it tasted like blueberry,
you know, just candy like blueberry,
[SPEAKER_03]: almost blueberry, muffiny, blueberry
candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the best of the blueberry line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man, I don't know if I want to get
into a hot take deep into two hours here,
[SPEAKER_03]: man, but I got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy that wrote the book.
[SPEAKER_03]: On breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: While we're talking about blueberry,
the man who wrote the book on cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding has also contributed one of the
most hermaphroditic strains in the history
[SPEAKER_03]: of cannabis genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a safe way of putting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are so many problems in blueberry
that anybody that's ever worked with those
[SPEAKER_03]: that strain in any capacity whatsoever
would really go like it's so funny when
[SPEAKER_03]: people ask me about herms, because that
guy's been selling that strain for 40
[SPEAKER_03]: years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every seed, every seed has a very high
probability of having hermaphroditic
[SPEAKER_03]: traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's blamed it on the tie.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's but you know, but in 40 years,
I feel like that's kind of fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I haven't a pair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he took that from the blue tie and
I haven't grown the blue tie to say for
[SPEAKER_01]: specific, but I've grown a lot of ties and
they're known for hermaphrodism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's kind of a fair blame.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you've been doing it for a long time,
I feel like it's not only a goal,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a responsibility for modern cannabis
to test your genetics and make sure it's
[SPEAKER_01]: stable for the home grower that can't
afford to waste time for their medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: growing out in stable genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, see, here's a big issue,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Stable has changed what stable meant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Through the late 90s, early 2000s meant
that if I bought a pack of 10 seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: those 10 seeds would generally all look
the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the term stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first started buying seeds as of
late, stable means they're not going to
[SPEAKER_03]: her.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is tough, man, because one of my
biggest pet peeves is the notion that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to solve the hermaphrodite
problem by over inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the notion that if instead of there
just being all these F1s and F2s
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere, if we had started and just
done nothing but inbreed every one of
[SPEAKER_03]: these lines to an F10, there would be no
herms anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: The notion is that if you just work that
line a little bit better, there's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be no more herms.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a plant that wants to breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're never going to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's natural inclination when it's
stressed, especially late in life,
[SPEAKER_03]: is to breed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the notion that you're going to over
inbreed and make that problem just
[SPEAKER_03]: miraculously disappear, inbreeding is
great for making a stable line of breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look alike, they breed alike,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We only have to look to dog breeding to
realize what over inbreeding does to a
[SPEAKER_03]: gene pool, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's certain breeds of dog that you
can't have around kids because they were
[SPEAKER_03]: bred to be white dogs with black spots and
nothing else.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we only focus on every filial
generation of an inbreeding line,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're getting rid of the herms.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got rid of the herms, but now we've
created something nobody cares to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because while you were focused on not
having herms, you weren't paying any
[SPEAKER_03]: attention to all the other 150 other
things that you need to look for in
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding a modern cannabis strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like that's one beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody wants people to lose money because
of herms.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have to be better about explaining
to people that the notion that that's ever
[SPEAKER_03]: going to just disappear, that any breeder
is selling seeds that produces an absolute
[SPEAKER_03]: zero percent herm ratio, it doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that you went more in depth with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not to say that you can't breed
for more stable genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it should always be, you know,
a number one priority in any breeding,
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's what the market dictates is
necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want plants that aren't going to throw
female male flowers and herm a whole room
[SPEAKER_03]: and ruin people's money.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other side to that is if I pop 200
seeds from assorted different breeders,
[SPEAKER_03]: I could probably make every one of those
plants flip male flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every every one of them, which means that
not necessarily you're lucky if it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: happen to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I'm saying is, at the end of a
plant stage, you have to just be diligent
[SPEAKER_03]: growing this plant indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's one of those things that like
we're doing really unnatural things with
[SPEAKER_03]: the way we're forcing them to grow the
spectrums we're using pruning techniques
[SPEAKER_03]: with with training techniques with indoor
lighting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, the notion that you can breed a
perfect strain that's going to hit every
[SPEAKER_03]: box isn't going to herm, you know,
it's it's it's going to wash five percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's going to be all resin and
no wax.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, man, you know, and it's one of those
things that like as a breeder,
[SPEAKER_03]: you think about all of this, you want,
you know, you want to make perfect
[SPEAKER_03]: selections.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to do the right, you know,
the right selection and make sure
[SPEAKER_03]: everything and then what it comes down to
is just having an eye.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something you can't really teach.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something you can't really tell
somebody how to do from looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: thousands and thousands of plants and
finally having an eye to be able to see
[SPEAKER_03]: what you're not seeing, to see what
potential in a plant, male plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: female plant, you know, that's going to
bring something that you haven't seen
[SPEAKER_03]: before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, you know, once you've seen one
hundred thousand plants, I always tell
[SPEAKER_03]: people biggest mistake a new grower will
make is keeping around a plant they should
[SPEAKER_03]: have gotten rid of because they haven't
had that thing yet of not every plant's a
[SPEAKER_03]: winner.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, even in a large enough
selection, you're going to kill some
[SPEAKER_03]: plants off.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to get rid of some plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any great grower has killed a couple of
plants along the way, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: both intentionally and unintentionally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, one of the things that you
have to do is you just have to say,
[SPEAKER_03]: look, if this plant's struggling,
it's probably easier for you to start
[SPEAKER_03]: another plant or to have started 15
percent more plants so that you can
[SPEAKER_03]: account for the fact that you're going to
have to kill some of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so many people drag those plants into
flower and they're like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe it's just genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's just it doesn't like your
feeding regimen, you know, but just having
[SPEAKER_03]: a less discerning eye about plants and
just saying, you know what, some of them
[SPEAKER_03]: are going to die.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they're not healthy, sometimes it's
easier to get rid of them than it is to
[SPEAKER_03]: drag a sick plant into the garden,
into flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you've brought all kinds of other
issues and pathogens and all kinds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a sick plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, anything can attack it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for saying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we were talking about that the
other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really become ruthless when you're
doing a big hunt and you're looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: something very specific or even just
trying to pull things apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have time if you're going to
find that something special to be going
[SPEAKER_01]: through these and putting up with the runs
or putting up with the heavy mutations
[SPEAKER_01]: that aren't worth a shit and veg and can't
keep up.
[SPEAKER_01]: With anything else, you know, it's I
popped a 12 pack and I had two that were
[SPEAKER_01]: really runny and I just pulled them out
right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's like, why didn't you see,
you know, they might have been females.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I do not have time for that shit
anymore because at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: what I want is I want that plant that
excelled.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's the one that I'm going to
keep around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only is it a great smoke, but it's got
to grow well, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care how good the smoke is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it takes me fucking four months to veg
it out, yeah, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much of that, man, that like as
a as a grower who's done it a few times,
[SPEAKER_03]: you kind of come to understand that what
you want is a plant that from the minute
[SPEAKER_03]: it hits water, it has the healthiest and
most beautiful life it can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I see all the time because I work
around hash makers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I work with hash growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I work with breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, other breeders who focus on
hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ask people all the time, like.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's important to you in your grow?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably not going to be important to
somebody else in their selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when when I'm picking for what makes a
great hash strain, it's almost never what
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody else is thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost always like, what is what?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do I feel like?
[SPEAKER_03]: What am I the most passionate about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if I'm putting passion into every
selection, into every thought and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything I'm doing in the garden at the
end of the day, the results are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: show from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the plants that people pick up and run
are going to be grown from minute one from
[SPEAKER_03]: what I thought was the best that I could
pick.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about all the time that we have for
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpene, thank you so much for joining me,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was an amazing podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got so much information out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a giveaway during the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big Bad John.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Stone Stew from our Patreon membership
won two packs that you donated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Block Knocker Ice Cream Man Grape Sunday
Crossed with Lucky Arms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will be having do or dab
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully Terpene can join us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will send you an invite tomorrow,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gonna be about five p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can make it, come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't, no big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we will be giving away the rest of the
genetics that you hand us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know I'm going to be hitting you up
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get some seeds off you as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where can everybody find your genetics
right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're looking for seeds, Terpene dot
com, w w w dot t e r p f i three nd dot
[SPEAKER_03]: com.
