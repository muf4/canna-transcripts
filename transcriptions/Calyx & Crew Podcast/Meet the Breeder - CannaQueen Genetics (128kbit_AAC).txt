[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Canna Queen on the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing Canna Queen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Doc, I'm good, how are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a beautiful fucking day over
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The weather is starting to heat up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got some Chernobyl in me this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get an opportunity to smoke?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always make time for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, and what were you smoking on this
morning?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm smoking on my mothers and the Queen
White Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Queen White Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard a lot about the Queen White
Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what Wisco Treefire was telling
me about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sent us over a pack of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stoked to pop those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Miss C got in on those zombie unicorn
right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah, that zombie unicorn.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one other garden growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely more in the testing
phases, but it's a fun strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I wanted to talk to you a little bit
about your history with this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: When did all this come about?
[SPEAKER_01]: When did you first start smoking?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I first started.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually remember the very first time I
smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were smoking on like an abandoned
school bus in like this fishing town.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, everybody was like all like,
you know, their eyes were chink and like
[SPEAKER_02]: they were giggling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, what is wrong with
you people?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, you know, I realized that,
you know, I guess maybe, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that first time you don't get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, maybe I just didn't realize
that I was high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get high my first time either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's a common thing, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then it's like, how can you not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what is, it's like maybe your
endocannabinoid system is like so empty
[SPEAKER_02]: because you've never, you know,
fulfilled it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that first high goes straight into
your receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of crazy to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or those receptors don't know how to react
to what's going on for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my first time, nope, didn't get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second time I slept for like 18 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember what you were smoking on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, back then I was just like,
it was like the Crip or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: BC Bud or you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we never really knew what we were
smoking, but it was like right in the air
[SPEAKER_02]: where the cannabis started changing from
like the Mexican brickweed all the time to
[SPEAKER_02]: like actual like Christmas tree buds and
the mango stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, that's when it started like
really blooming.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about the time that I started as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you start going from green bud
to actually having some names like white
[SPEAKER_01]: rhino and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when we actually started
calling it names other than, Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is chronic.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is MERSH, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the West coast MERSH is the
equivalent of the East coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: What'd you say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Crip?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Crippy, the, the, was that like
hydro or conic, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: There was just like a blanket name for
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We called it either hydro or chronic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That whole, that whole Crip thing,
the Crippy that's seems to be an East
[SPEAKER_01]: coast term.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just not familiar with it,
but I'm here in Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, it was definitely more of an East
coast or thing, but a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_02]: it started moving, you know, it started
moving out of where it's in New York and
[SPEAKER_02]: California and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how old were you at this point?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was probably about 15 turning
16, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at what point did you go from smoking
cannabis to saying I want to grow this for
[SPEAKER_01]: myself?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do have to rewind a little bit,
a little bit after I started smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, I started realizing that some
things are changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as like my brain chemicals,
I wasn't, I wasn't as, uh, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: say sad, but like I had a pretty tough
childhood and I went through a lot and it
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't the best home life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so every time I smoked, it really felt
like it was doing something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was touching my soul.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I just, I didn't smoke for the
same reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody else said, yeah, like I was
going to like be around my friends and
[SPEAKER_02]: like, yeah, we're getting high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, let's get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, really I knew it was doing
something different for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the minute I had the chance to,
uh, pop a seed, I did, I think it was like
[SPEAKER_02]: 14 when I popped my first seed and tried
to grow it outside in Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you know about Florida,
but it's, uh, it's humid, it's high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, hurricanes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, uh, you know, the winds blew
really hard and blew my little tree over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was so depressed and sad about it,
but that was my little first experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I made, when I was about 18 and
we moved away from Florida and we traveled
[SPEAKER_02]: the entire country.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I, yeah, so I kind of like put
that on the back burner, but we ended up
[SPEAKER_02]: landing in Colorado at Fort Carson and he
actually got kicked out of the army for
[SPEAKER_02]: testing positive for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he got a general Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really sucked because it was our
livelihood.
[SPEAKER_02]: We lived on post.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, anyway, long story short, he got
kicked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ended up staying in Colorado and I'm
like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm going to start growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my friend's husband, he was a military
veteran and, uh, he was like, he was
[SPEAKER_02]: already growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every time I go to her house and like,
can I see it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I like just see it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, finally she was like,
I don't know, you know, he's not here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's really protective, blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So finally one day he was there and he was
like, hell yeah, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he took me in there and I, I've never
felt such joy in my entire life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing what I saw in that, that garage
that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what were some of those first ones that
you grew up?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so I ended up seeing his,
his grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, yep, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I linked up with a local guy there and
he had a bunch of seeds reserved,
[SPEAKER_02]: saved up from his, you know, his dad from
like eighties to nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had like elephant stomper and
strawberry cough and wifi, OG,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, AK 47 destroyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there was some really good classic
ones in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, so yeah, that's a blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's like the strains that I
started up with my first row.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're growing at a young age.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you started smoking at a young age.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long did it take you while you were
growing until you decide, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make the step in making some
types of cannabis that work for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I can produce for myself under the
name.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this isn't a story that I get to share
very often.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a story that it's actually
literally what sparked my joy to do more
[SPEAKER_02]: than just grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll try to like make it short.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a long story, but my
neighbor, he was retired, not retired,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he was kicked.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a medically discharged from the
army.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had PTSD and he had a lot of pain and
he had epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he was having probably about seven
seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: A day on a good day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were 25 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just watched this and him and his
wife, and like, they were trying to start
[SPEAKER_02]: their life out and they were just
stumbling and falling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, they were smoking spice at the
time, which at the time it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it had been killing people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm like, he can't be smoking that
he has epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is wrong with you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's probably why he's having
seven seizures a day, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I grew a clone from that said,
uh, military veteran.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my friend's husband.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was ace of seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spades.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized that I didn't get me that
high, but I like, I knew, I knew what that
[SPEAKER_02]: meant, you know, like that it had some CBD
factors to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I offered him an ounce from like one of
my very first harvest, like real good
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I had a thousand watt Raptor eight,
eight line fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I had the whole shebang.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that was at the time,
like that was, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I handed his wife an ounce of the ace
of spades.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, tell him just to put the spice
down, just give this a chance,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it probably took about a whole month
for her to come to me and be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, he quit smoking the spice.
[SPEAKER_02]: He started smoking the ACEs, you know,
the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, he's been 43 days without a
seizure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like literally that, I knew that wasn't my
strain, but I knew I wanted to have that
[SPEAKER_02]: pride from something I created.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was medicine that you created for a
patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't matter if it was your type
or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was medicine that you produced that you
made and you help somebody with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the, there's nothing better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the most amazing feeling that I've
ever had.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, he, he ended up, you know,
getting a quality of life back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately they divorced and she went
on her way, but there was a lot of damage
[SPEAKER_02]: done between, you know, before he,
he healed himself, which you change,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and things change, but he,
I see him today and he's, he's healthy and
[SPEAKER_02]: happy and it's just crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that was, that was the fire that
got started in kind of clean soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: And uh, so was that one of the first
plants that you bred with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, no, I didn't breed with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I got picked up by a state,
a breeder in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to name drop, but like he,
he saw all my pictures on Instagram and he
[SPEAKER_02]: wrote me and he was like, dude,
he's like, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, no, it's not a dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a she.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, I want you on my team.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I, he's like, I ain't ever seen
a girl grow like this before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, so he was like,
I want to teach you how to breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, dude, I just got,
you know, good, good at this rowing thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I don't know if I'm ready
for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, I'm backed up and I just
need you to F2.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I'll help you make the
selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's like, I need you to F2,
uh, this CBD strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Ooh, here's my chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was like destined,
you know, like that is a CBD strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: A foot in the door for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, long story short, I did the breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made three little men gales.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my very first strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a three to one CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is Harlequin times tsunami or sour
tsunami times an unknown West Coast
[SPEAKER_02]: strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: He, he had it listed as unknown West Coast
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I think that was his way of
protecting at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but he had it tested and, um,
yeah, it tested that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: three to one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, he got half the seed stock
and then I got half the seed stock and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, he made a good chunk of money off of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we parted ways and he hooked me up
with another reader.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I realized that I, you know,
these guys were using me to breed behind
[SPEAKER_02]: the scenes for them with no name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Nope, this is my time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm going to step forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ended up, you know, partnership with
the other, the second breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Canada queen genetics was born in
2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this time, when you were getting
into it, what, what was some of your main
[SPEAKER_01]: intentions on breeding cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it all CBD related?
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, no, that was really my only CBD
project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started going more towards a very high
THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was, it was what the hype
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to go like towards the market
where the market was going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had already bred under a different
breeder's name, a bunch of really killer
[SPEAKER_02]: strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ended up when we broke up, I say broke
up because it was literally like when our
[SPEAKER_02]: partnership broke up, like we had to,
you had to split equipment down the middle
[SPEAKER_02]: and all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was literally like a breakup.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got half the babies and he got half
the babies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, we, we went our
separate ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's when Queen White Haze was
born.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the first staple strain that
made Canna Queen a name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is my legacy strain for my company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was the cross on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: The cross on Queen White Haze is Oro
Blanco by Bodhi, which is the white times
[SPEAKER_02]: Wookiee times Miami Heat, which is exotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was true to my roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I just knew that it was
going to be, you know, originally it was
[SPEAKER_02]: supposed to be like a white version of the
Black Haze, but I really bred it more
[SPEAKER_02]: towards the OG side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it became more an OG than a haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would tell people in the beginning
of the F1s and F2s, it was an OG haze all
[SPEAKER_02]: the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd find OGs, you'd find hazes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd find OGs with haze high,
and you'd find hazes with OG high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, when I first heard the name
Canna Queen, that was the first strain
[SPEAKER_01]: that was for the first type of cannabis
that was thrown out there to represent you
[SPEAKER_01]: was everybody was saying, grow the Queen
White, grow the Queen White, grow the
[SPEAKER_01]: Queen White.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going, okay, well, maybe I'll pay
a bit more attention to this gal.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's obviously got something going on
that people love.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the flowering time like on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You said it leaned closer to the OG,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does lean close to the OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the flowering times are, I mean,
I've seen one harvest at 56 days,
[SPEAKER_02]: 64 days, 70 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: But mostly between 60 and 70 days is your
sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like cloudy, half amber.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely, yeah, definitely leading
towards that OG side.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a beautiful flowering time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so frosty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like she definitely lives up to her name,
like everything about her except for the
[SPEAKER_02]: haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the high does come out in some of the
Finos, the haze high.
[SPEAKER_02]: But especially she's definitely more of a
heavier high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like icing on the cake,
the trichomes is icing on the cake because
[SPEAKER_02]: when you press her, she'll give you a 30
or 32% return like every time,
[SPEAKER_02]: every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's the turf profile like on her?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have F1, F2, F3, V2 and BX1.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you get to the BX1, I locked in
that piney, lemony, like it's almost like
[SPEAKER_02]: Murphy's Oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some that have like a burnt rubber
tire turp to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's pretty big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I like asking all
of the people that I interview,
[SPEAKER_01]: or all the breeders I should say that I
interview, is what top three to five
[SPEAKER_01]: strains best represent your company and
what you're trying to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously that Queen White Haze,
you said that is the staple of Canna Queen
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any others that just you're
really trying to promote and put out
[SPEAKER_01]: there?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just going to say like as far as
like crowd favorites, the crowd favorites
[SPEAKER_02]: are definitely Queen White Haze number
one, Lemon Delight number two,
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue Tree Stars probably number three,
three little nightingales.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That nightingale was one that you made
with the breeder over in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the three little nightingales is an
F3 of his strain, the nightingale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you recreated that and took your name?
[SPEAKER_02]: I made that strain at my selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I changed the name because I don't
think it's right when you stomp on,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I say stomp on, but you can be making
it better or making it worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know until you, you know,
until the progeny, but it deserves a new
[SPEAKER_02]: title.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I always stay true to the strain
lineages.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's somewhere in the name, you know,
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about that Lemon Delight?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the lineage on that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so Lemon Delight is it's a Queen's
treat, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's what the name is about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's Lemon Royale by Swamp Boys,
which is Lemon Tree times GMO TK Skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually heard that was a great one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to say that if you like a
longer flowering one, she's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's probably a 12 to 14 week or just
depending on what you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all about the long flowerings over
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I'm talking like lemon tree all
day long, like fresh lemonade,
[SPEAKER_02]: sand, grime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's also like a GMO Fino that they
love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lefty's farm did a collab with me on
operations grow season two.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a blind grow and they found out
what strain they were growing halfway
[SPEAKER_02]: through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it ended up being the Lemon Delight F2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Lefty at the time was doing a Finoha
of the TK NL five Hayes by AK Beanbrains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he hit his best Lemon Delight with the
TK NL five Hayes male.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he sent me almost all the seeds that he
had made, which was a bunch and something
[SPEAKER_02]: kept telling me to pop them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess I, you know, I guess you don't
think about this when you're trying new
[SPEAKER_02]: strains that you've made, you're just
like, yeah, I'm about to smoke it and
[SPEAKER_02]: taste it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually did it live on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoked the mess up and it was
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The smoke was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll sit in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yeah, I feel great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ended up being called.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Menage Delight is the name of the
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had to nickname it mess up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like mess mess up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's really bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get off the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like, you know, I feel really
energetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna go get some stuff done and I'll
see you guys later.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get off the phone and like 10 minutes
later, I kid you not, my heart was beating
[SPEAKER_02]: out of my chest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, did you hear that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, did you hear that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like something's outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like broad daylight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have never in my life had to smoke
CBD to come down from flower ever in my
[SPEAKER_02]: entire life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I knew something was up with this
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't touch it for a whole month after
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was caring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was telling all my people,
I'm like, Nope, stay away from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's messed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That strain is messed up, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it kind of stuck, you know,
and then they all wanted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, we want to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no, I just need to come with a
disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you have heart problems,
this strain is not okay for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's, it sounds like Tyson
trying to say messed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny that you brought that up about
taking CBD to bring you down from a
[SPEAKER_01]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people have their, you know,
withholdings about CBD and its efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things about CBD is it
needs that THC with it in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: activate in order to touch those receptors
and be effective, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, the entourage effect,
you know, the TB, the CBD piggybacks on
[SPEAKER_02]: the THC and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't really work as well without
the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but there's a few things you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get too high, you can chug a beer
because like alcohol is a depressant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're like really, really high and
you, you're freaking out because you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of people aren't used to this
medical grade stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're like, what, what'd you do to
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fine before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's too strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff hits different now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so you can chug a beer or you can
smell pepper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pepper does something to your brain where
I can't really understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I'm like not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Must be that cariofiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, CBD and people just,
they just shun CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what's funny about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: We were doing an event in Seattle at
HempFest and there was a booth there that
[SPEAKER_01]: sold CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know if it was isolated or
it said full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but HempFest doesn't allow,
you know, any THC over there, but he had
[SPEAKER_01]: these CBD dabs and then he had extract
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could add, um, whatever flavor
profile you want to the CBD deck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right before that Miss C and I had,
we were passing around this big old one
[SPEAKER_01]: ounce joint that I had rolled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we were sharing it pre COVID days
and we were just high as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was with my brother that doesn't
smoke cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he's never done a drug in his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just ripped on this one ounce
joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we go to this booth and I said,
well, I'll try the CBD dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sat down.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a little e-nail on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put the isolate in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We picked my terpenes and I think it was
peach or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I took just an enormous rip and it was
so smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I just kept puffing on it,
kept puffing on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I stood up and he's like,
well, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, it sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, what do you mean it sucks?
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like you enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I'm not high at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked a one ounce fucking joint and you
just made me waste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, that's my testimony to how well
CBD can work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just how you use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just looked it up real quick about
the pepper and it says it's not an old
[SPEAKER_02]: wives tale.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're battling a bit of THC induced
anxiety, paranoia, your body suggests
[SPEAKER_02]: sniffing or chewing on black peppercorns,
a few sniffs, immediate effect while
[SPEAKER_02]: chewing peppercorns could provide a relief
for about an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up to an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually quite a bit of time for
just sniffing some pepper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take a short break.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on a short break.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to give a quick shout out to
Diamond Cut Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys can go over to Diamond Cut
Company and use Doc minus 10% for 10% off
[SPEAKER_01]: your order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since making the switch over to Diamond
Cut Company, I have not wanted to use
[SPEAKER_01]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: They meet and exceed every expectation
that I have in a trimming scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the most beautiful trimming
scissors ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like a piece of jewelry and they
keep their edge forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you keep them clean,
they have tons of different models,
[SPEAKER_01]: the classics, which I use to chop up my
buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer not to use a grinder when I'm
rolling a blunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer a coarser grind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use the classics to chop up my bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also have the six five, which
incorporates the finger loop and it is
[SPEAKER_01]: spring as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use those as my general handyman
scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also have the pros, which have a
rounded hand grip and a heavier spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can actually use those for
physically taking down smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything from like a one to three gallon,
they usually seem to be pretty well with,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as de-stemming before the trimming
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite model though is the Harvester.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come in both gold and silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're springless so you can trim it as
fast as your hand will fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since there's no resistance against
your hand, it also means less fatigue and
[SPEAKER_01]: longer trimming time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miss C's favorite model is the Artisan.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Artisan does have a spring and it's
very clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's comparable to a lot of the top of the
line models that most companies use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I find that the Artisans have a
lighter spring, which again leads to less
[SPEAKER_01]: hand fatigue and longer trimming time,
as well as a more comfortable grip and a
[SPEAKER_01]: sharper edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one last time, shout out to Diamond Cut
Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys can go over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use doc minus 10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's doc minus 10% for 10% off your
order.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's get back with Canna Queen
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey everybody and welcome back to the
Calix & Crew podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before the break, we were talking to Canna
Queen Genetics about her experiences with
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant at a young age.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her experiences getting into growing and
how she got introduced to breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also talked about some strains that
best represent her company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was shouting out that lemon
delight sounds delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: The queen white haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody has recommended that to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm stoked to pop back in here with
Canna Queen and talk more about what she's
[SPEAKER_01]: got coming up in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is going to happen with Canna Queen
Genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say what's going to happen with
Canna Queen Genetics, but I would like to
[SPEAKER_02]: think that we will be operating somewhere
in a huge field of dreams with warehouses
[SPEAKER_02]: full of meteorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for now, I'm just forwarding,
working these lines, like really just
[SPEAKER_02]: putting in the work and eventually,
you know, my strains will do my talking
[SPEAKER_02]: for me and we'll see where that takes us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am actually breeding the triple X
candy and the triple X candy was a special
[SPEAKER_02]: project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had gotten some pollen from a friend of
the death-forbidden candy as a fishing out
[SPEAKER_02]: of strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Skittles times Royal Kush times
Highland Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super hashy, super fruity, beautiful
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hit the X18 times the white by White
Buffalo Sea Company with it and I created
[SPEAKER_02]: the triple X candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The male was the most impressive plant
I've almost ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was covered in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was colorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: He definitely had more of a Skittles leaf
trait, but I didn't really see that come
[SPEAKER_02]: through as much in the F2s because they
favor the X18.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: What colorations were you getting in the
fade?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oranges and burnt umbers and reds and
plums.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I have it listed on my IG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keratin doesn't get enough appreciation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody loves the dark purple,
the black fades, but I've always had like
[SPEAKER_01]: a special place in my heart for the
oranges and reds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have a special place in the
heart for the males.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not get enough appreciation.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't get enough FaceTime.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't get enough credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we need females.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're obviously important,
but I think the male is generally- It's
[SPEAKER_00]: funny that you say that as we're talking
to a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: The males do not get enough respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a male-dominated industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most men are assholes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not me sticking up for the females
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can be an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody can be an asshole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so much assholes, but they're worse
than females.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're worse than females.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pettier than- I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I decided this was going to be my
job, I was like hell to the yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to deal with all these petty
women hating me because whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I get that same thing that I thought
I wasn't going to get here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: We face a lot of adversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a feminist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not power to the vagina, but if you
guys would just give us half a fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: chance and you would let us work with you,
you would see that we bring something to
[SPEAKER_02]: the table that you never could.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were created to- Yeah, it's definitely
something that shouldn't be gender-related
[SPEAKER_01]: at all, especially when women- naturally
pay more attention to things than men do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's those fine details that comes with
that whole nature versus nurture where I
[SPEAKER_01]: might go into my grow room and say,
you're a little soggy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you a little droopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you a little bit of water and
I'll catch you later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms. C will actually go through and look at
him and make sure everything's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's kind of like my second pair of eyes
and she's a little bit more detailed than
[SPEAKER_01]: I am and she catches things that I just
don't catch.
[SPEAKER_02]: On that point, a lot of people discredit
me, for instance, because I'm more of a
[SPEAKER_02]: intuitive, instinctive type grower and
breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I'll see two plants and I'm
like, yes, seemingly you guys are perfect
[SPEAKER_02]: for each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's things under, recessive things
that you cannot see that you could bring
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I do pick the two best plants,
in my opinion, as far as breeding,
[SPEAKER_02]: I also go with my second choice that's in
the back of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should hit those two.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not perfect, but you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine times out of 10, that second cross I
make, that version two that I make,
[SPEAKER_02]: is the one that I end up going with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's plants that when you smell
that terpene profile, it hits certain
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors in your brain that when they
turn you on, they make you happy and they
[SPEAKER_01]: make you feel good and you have a good
feeling about that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely something that you
should investigate further because
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously there's something about that
whole makeup of that cannabinoid profile
[SPEAKER_01]: in that particular phenotype that's just
saying, it's calling to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think too with a lot of breeders,
they're breeding more towards their
[SPEAKER_02]: preference only.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a firm believer in making three
versions if you need to of the same cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can, if you have the selections,
I definitely encourage making more than
[SPEAKER_02]: one version because one version could be
for you and one version could be for your
[SPEAKER_02]: mom and one version could be for your
sister.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't want to single out just what
I want and I think that a lot of breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying that's bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying maybe that makes me a more
thorough breeder when I hit more than just
[SPEAKER_02]: what my selections would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that is few and far between,
but there is a couple of breeders that
[SPEAKER_01]: like isolating certain phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just really love variety so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a very dependable test team so they
love it when I send different versions of
[SPEAKER_02]: the same strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice, very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who all do you have on your testing team?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to give a quick shout out?
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have about 19 on my gardening
team.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's grown over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've really built like a little family.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to forget some, so I hope
they don't kill me, but Smurf and the
[SPEAKER_02]: Stone, Wawa Cantergros, Tolka's 69,
Grim Smurf Banks, Dubb's, I just have so
[SPEAKER_02]: many and they all bring a different factor
and they're all over the country too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have some in Scotland.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some in South Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out Delta 9 and shout out Forbidden
High Till I Die Farms in Scotland.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really cool to see the different
phenotypic expressions, especially the
[SPEAKER_02]: South Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grew the Women's Delight and I mean,
black.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Leaves of the Queen, I mean the
Women's Delight were completely black.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a stunning plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you got that you're working on
right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I kind of got off base,
but yeah, I'm doing the Triple X Candy
[SPEAKER_02]: F3s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing the Queen White Haze,
Back Cross 1 with the Smurf and the Stone
[SPEAKER_02]: cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smurf and the Stone won the Dillon Queen's
grow off, which was my third grow off that
[SPEAKER_02]: I had run on my own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he won with the Queen White Haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I used his cut to back cross at F4.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so that's what I'm working on right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was it about that cut that just
did it for you that you said this needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: be the back cross?
[SPEAKER_02]: So honestly, I wasn't that sold on it just
because of how she looked, but she was,
[SPEAKER_02]: every time he grew her, he grew her like
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he grew her in a greenhouse and she was
like rainbow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like her fade was just rainbow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like her buds are this purple,
underneath the leaves is purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super frosty, super dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But every time he grew her, it was better
and better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last time he grew her,
she had like this more low, like almost
[SPEAKER_02]: like a brick red color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh, she was magnificent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, you know what Smurf, send her to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's been screaming at me for three years
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just send her to me and we'll collab on a
back cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took three years for you to agree on
that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I wanted to see what else,
you know, there was a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: growing her and there was a lot of
different phenos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was seeing the same ones,
you know, throughout the mix, but this was
[SPEAKER_02]: the one that was just like, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you keep your lines pretty open or are
you more into bottlenecking it into a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain type?
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like that you like your
variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're trying to keep your lines a
little bit more open, but you're giving
[SPEAKER_01]: the people that want the option of the
best phenotype in your opinion to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to select for that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for a long time I only had about 14
strains released and behind the scenes,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, every time I was flowering,
I was breathing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have about 50 or 55 strains that I've
actually created.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just released 47 of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are strains that somewhere at F2,
somewhere at F1, somewhere at F4,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends on what strain it is,
but everybody, there's something for
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else are you working on that you're,
you're really stoked about?
[SPEAKER_02]: I had gotten some seeds from a friend in
the Emerald, I didn't want to call it
[SPEAKER_02]: Murder Mountain, Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he sent me some double OG and I'm
literally like, I love OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I popped those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found a male and I found a female with
the double OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did a binary cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a male double OG to the female Queen
White Haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I did a female Queen White Haze
to the vice versa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like, I'm dyslexic, so my brain flip
flops it for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I did it binary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whichever, you know, I flipped it with
the other cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm excited about those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the, we just named the strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Lorena Del Sur, which means
Queen of the South.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I thought so too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this, what made you decide to work with
the Purple Wookiee?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have to like, I just have to
say this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to meet Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to tell him that my signature strain
was made with his Orta Blanco.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, are you bringing some more
back?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like where are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: They just disappeared.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, you know, now, now it's like my
second top strain I've ever grown and bred
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my strains has actually replaced
it, but I got to talk to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to pick his brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to show him some of the phenols that
I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, he did Purple Wookiee
and I was dying to work with some kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk, some kind of, you know,
roadkill skunk, but not from certain
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I saw Bodhi had the roadkill unicorn
and he crossed it to the Wookiee and I was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, oh, you know, I like Wookiee too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, he knows the way to my heart through
his strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wookiee's almost in everything that I
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like literally, it's somehow, well
obviously if the Queen White Haze is in
[SPEAKER_02]: it, Wookiee's in it, you know,
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had heard about the Wookiee for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that name kept popping up,
Wookiee, Wookiee, Wookiee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people, a lot of people think
that it's the white times cookies,
[SPEAKER_02]: which it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's lavender times Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people, when they say the
white times cookies, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: ew, why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you even think that?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you just take the W and you put
cookie, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe there is a Wookiee cookie,
but you know, not, not Wookiee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to try for the very first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was the purple Wookiee.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, okay, well I finally have the
opportunity to try some Wookiee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't know what to expect out of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that much about it other
than that name kept popping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after we smoked the purple Wookiee,
I was like, this is something I would
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the high isn't scamp either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice, even high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So purple Wookiee is roadkill unicorn
times Wookiee.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you break down roadkill unicorn,
you got roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have blackberry widow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where you get all those berries,
you know, undertones and stuff from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you definitely get that widow too,
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call it halitosis because that's the
only way I can explain it to people who
[SPEAKER_02]: can't smell it, but it's like bad breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's what widow smells like to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always thought to me, widow was very
like muskier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody perceives smells different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put your perception out there no
matter how bad it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, I'm one of those people that
if the worst you make it sound,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more I want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the more you can relate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know what a burnt rubber tire smells
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know what lemon smells like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I put those two together,
yes, that's something that I would like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember, I remember being a younger
punk and stealing some of my mom's vodka.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we took a swig off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my brother goes, well, what do you
think it tastes like?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, it tastes like fucking
tastes like oil lamp oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, how do you know what that
tastes like?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't, but that's my perception.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then when people say that, like,
how do you know what that smells like?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you know what it tastes like?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like because your smell can translate
to taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you're given those senses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we love talking to you, Kana Queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for coming on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we end this, is there anybody that
you would like to shout out, sponsors,
[SPEAKER_01]: what have you?
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, thank you so much for having
me on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've given me a little stand for my
voice, and that's super important to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really had a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did shout out my guardsmen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one more time, I wouldn't be where I
am if it wasn't for their thorough testing
[SPEAKER_02]: and growing for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, guardsmen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, my friend, Johnny Nugs,
will be vending at any can beans stock and
[SPEAKER_02]: bean con at the Fishit booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out Fishit and Johnny Nugs at
Canalogic Inc.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, my soil is so very generously
sponsored by Bio 365, my rep, Bio 365 Tim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing people, very knowledgeable,
backed by science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen great things with that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful, beautiful work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weren't you also doing a contest for
people that were growing your type?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, in April, I'm having the first
annual Canna Queen Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a private sesh for the first
annual, just so we can iron out some kinks
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're doing a blind judging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody who's coming has grown some of
my gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll be blind judging that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have prizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had some prizes sponsored by What
the Fuck Wisco Treefire for the slaps and
[SPEAKER_02]: some art.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like how you say that, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we have to definitely give him a
little spotlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't mention him in my garden,
but it's not actually what the fuck,
[SPEAKER_01]: though, is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just WTF for the Wisco Treefire,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I guess that's just how I read
it every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time he pops into my life,
I'm like, what the fuck Wisco Treefire?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he added that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, it stands for Wisco
Treefire.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still to this day call him what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's just a solid, solid,
solid guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: A good friend and definitely make some
amazing slaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: He prints.
[SPEAKER_02]: So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this cup that you're doing the first
ever Cannabis Queen Cup, it was that the
[SPEAKER_01]: name, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can a queen cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can a queen cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it what is the is there some kind of
incentive?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there prizes for somebody that wins
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to have all kinds of
prizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be playing all kinds of
games.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be like a joint rolling
competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really want to give away all the
details, but there's going to be prizes
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're buying instead of like a
trophy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're buying like dab rigs and stuff for
game winners and some of the competition
[SPEAKER_02]: winners and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a fun time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bio 365 was actually so generous and sent
me a 10 by four banner with like their
[SPEAKER_02]: logo and my logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anybody that wants to get into this can
of Queen Cup over on the East Coast,
[SPEAKER_01]: what are the credentials like?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any rules to it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a traveling event.
[SPEAKER_02]: I decided that we didn't want it to be a
stationary event this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's obviously in Michigan and next year
we're planning on it being in Oklahoma and
[SPEAKER_02]: then possibly New England a year after.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be a traveling event.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I mean, you definitely have to
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do an overall best cannabis
of the entire weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't even have to be my gear,
but we're going to do two separate,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, competitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: One can of Queen only genetic and then
one, whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, people who maybe didn't get
the draw or didn't get the harvest in
[SPEAKER_02]: time, you know, they still get to bring
something and get the competing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like a fun time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always love a good joint rolling
competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for coming on Can of Queen.

go over to her website, check her out,
[SPEAKER_01]: pick up the packed seeds and see what
she's working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a female breeder that is putting
in tons of work that wants to get her name
[SPEAKER_01]: out there and rightly so, deserving it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some beautiful plants I've seen coming out
that Queen White Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some lemon delight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen all kinds of pictures from tons
of growers that are growing her genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: yet her name just isn't getting out there,
which I find absolutely astonishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Canna Queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we can get her back on the show one
day, see what she's up to in the future.
