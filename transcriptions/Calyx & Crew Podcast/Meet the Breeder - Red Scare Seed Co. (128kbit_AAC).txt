[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, everyone, and welcome to a
new episode of Meet the Breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Red Scare Seed Company joining
us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing, brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was lucky enough to get a catch up
with you and make sure Vimeo worked with
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we kind of talked about, you know,
what we had had in common with grow styles
[SPEAKER_01]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you let everybody know that
isn't familiar with Red Scare Seed
[SPEAKER_01]: Company, what you're about and what you're
trying to achieve with your company?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I'm just a small dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic grower, like a lot of dudes,
you know, I do have a lot of use a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: Korean natural farming inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't stand on my soapbox and preach
about it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just kind of the way I've been
doing things for a lot of years,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, probably the last decade or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I kind of started off just to
preserve and to create seeds for my self
[SPEAKER_00]: and my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never really was supposed to be a
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, it was just making seeds
because we didn't have access to seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty much how I started off
and just kind of grew from there
[SPEAKER_00]: organically, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some years passed, you know, I was kind of
in and out of the scene for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being from Kentucky, we didn't when I
started growing, you know, there was the
[SPEAKER_00]: circle of growers didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no other people that I knew
that cultivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know really any other grower in
the state besides at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I don't want to call him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a senator now in the state of
Kentucky, Dan Siem, who is running... Do
[SPEAKER_00]: we have to bleep that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you don't have to bleep that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just say he knew some people up in
the Louisville area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me and my buddies, we didn't know
anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was pretty much kind of on an island
by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting seeds was hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't know if they were going to show
or not back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just the natural thing to do is
just create your own seeds and and go from
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some of the first types that you
started preserving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, you know, it's just I'm going
to be real bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would if I'm going to go way back,
it was like we would collect the best bag
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all off season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the springtime, we would just
randomly pop everything we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were times that we found things
that were just absolutely remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grew with the resin of the old school
white widow, but just absolutely reeked of
[SPEAKER_00]: garlic way back before anybody had garlic,
butter, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these things, I suppose, were just
mashups of who knows, heirlooms from
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico, maybe some California genetics
tossed in any of the bridge going through
[SPEAKER_00]: grab exactly any brick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was light green, you better believe
we were keeping seeds out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the criteria back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it light green?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, the seeds are probably worth
keeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it smell of anything other than mold?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, then we might have kept it and
grown it, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did you originally get into
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your first experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, just smoking with buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I guess a few years passing,
I started smoking in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you know, smoking on occasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I saw my first plants, I guess,
like up close when I was about 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of stuck with me a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit older than most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, coming from Kentucky,
it's like to see anybody's plants is
[SPEAKER_00]: always pretty pretty miraculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an old buddy, Roger Cotton,
rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: This old dude would grow 10 foot plants
back behind his trailer in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his sons would always take me back
there and be like, hey, man, check these
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd go sniff these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just like that's when I knew
that's what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I needed more of that in my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to explore the aromas and the
aesthetics were just too much to pass up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from that point on, I think I started
trying to find we found some old magazines
[SPEAKER_00]: of his and there were all these old Afghan
pictures and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of when I initially
fell in love with the Afghans is seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: those old fat wide leaves on the Christmas
tree shaped plants and big chunky buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what got, you know,
drew me in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a few years later, I lost my
financial aid and scholarships for a half
[SPEAKER_00]: a gram of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from that point on, I was like,
well, they took away my education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too expensive for me to go to school
now because I have nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that around 2002 is when I decided I'm
going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what, you know, that's the
direction I went in at all at all cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between the time when you first started
growing cannabis to breed it, what was the
[SPEAKER_01]: change?
[SPEAKER_01]: What made you decide that you wanted to
breed?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how long did it take after you saw
your saw your first plants come out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground until you were like, I'm going to
start making some of these myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we made some mistakes along the
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trusting people was number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got robbed a few times by roommates or
friend of a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you slip up and tell your best
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He tells his friend all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys don't like you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come take your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess for me, sometime around like oh
seven, I started messing around with like
[SPEAKER_00]: some reefer man genetics, a gypsy's kiss
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Thunder, I think was one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Petrolia's had a lot of Petrolia
headstache crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess losing those plants and then
looking back six months later and being
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, I wish we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some of those gypsy kiss seeds,
but we have none.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it clicked like you've got to
preserve this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to start creating and you know,
you're going to lose your favorite plants
[SPEAKER_00]: forever if you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was the first plant that you
worked with?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the big it was a big Thunder plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the Matanuska Thunderfuck cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was one of the first ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was some random pollen off a male that
I didn't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I ended up with about 15 ripe
seeds, and that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from that, I took those with me down
to Tennessee and ran a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran 15 and then ran those for a while
and then made some more off of that and
[SPEAKER_00]: then took a took a small break and went
out west for a while and tried naive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was naive and thought I could just like,
oh, I'm going to go out west.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get a job on some mountain
and that's going to be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just that most of the time is
just a dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I came back, I came back with a
wealth of knowledge and new genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and that's kind of when I just stuck
with it and kept making seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know the one that I've seen you
work probably the most on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if this is the one that you
work the most on, but I've seen you do a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of work with that GMO fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even be even have problems with other
people using GMO fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she's she's popular with with the
boys in the yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked the GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like how it extracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that the turps didn't really
carry over in the flavor that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: times it might smell really rancid like
garlic or onion and just skunk ass or
[SPEAKER_00]: death.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the flavor is going to come
across as I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's depending on how late you
took GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extracts would almost come out like an
attic or grandma's perfume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no matter what extractor I got it
from, that seemed to be the like that like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want I don't want that in my
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So me being the OG head, I'm like,
well, let's smack it with with a nice OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time I had a really nice rocket
fuel mail from Archive and always been a
[SPEAKER_00]: big fan of their gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Politics aside, or, you know, Canada,
Canada politics aside, I've been,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, always been a fan of their gear
and always found good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just smacked them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first the F1s came out terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't release them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds were mainly pale and immature.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them cracked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say 95 percent fail rate on that
first project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't release a single pack of the
F1s and then made and then grew those out
[SPEAKER_00]: and made some F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was growing those out that I
realized this is really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I released a small amount of the
F2s and that's kind of when it took off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So was it just a a low bearing seed plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it produced a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still have this problem even with
the F6.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a really finicky seed producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of some like OGs that just
don't really produce a ton of viable
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll produce thousands of white,
immature seeds and maybe a couple,
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple hundred or so like really mature
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen a few strains kind of do
that throughout the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And me being a perfectionist, I'm like,
well, my room is shit right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not dialed in like it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss hit the timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I've got another strain that's
just crushing it, you know, producing
[SPEAKER_00]: these big black viable seeds with the
tiger stripes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, some genetics just don't,
you know, want to produce seeds for you
[SPEAKER_00]: like others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the way it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you actually, I told you earlier,
we got those packs from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Red Scare Seed Company has donated
three packs of seeds to our Patreon
[SPEAKER_01]: members here.
[SPEAKER_01]: A GMO Fuel F6, like he was just talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard you work with this one quite a
bit, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know more about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the Ludens Cough Drop F2?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's guess on that for a sec.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he sent a pack of Curvature 2.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to hear about both those as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Ludens Cough Drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this like a cherry, like the classic?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody knows that or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back in Michigan, I had a pack of
cherry Tahoe from in-house and I never
[SPEAKER_00]: really ran a bunch of in-house stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of their profiles don't really suit
my needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the slur cane and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the cherry Tahoe is one of their
earlier packs, I presume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I popped it and it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Tahoe really came out with some like
bright cherry undertones, sweet almond
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry with just that earthy forest floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the resin stacks on it were amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just so coated, just dumped with
sugar, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, you're in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to take at the time I was running
a bunch of coffee F3 from Pacific
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwest Roots and picked what I thought
was the nicest representation of that out
[SPEAKER_00]: of like 20 or 30 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget however many I kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, and then cross those up
and I kind of set them on the back burner
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long time and never really messed
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just kind of sat there for a few
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happens a lot as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of work a bunch of stuff and some
things you don't get to right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I handed them off to my buddy,
City of Homes Horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up in Massachusetts and about a year
later, he hits me up with some picks and
[SPEAKER_00]: he's like, hey, I finally popped these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh shit, you know, good luck,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the picks start coming in,
I'm like, oh, this is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to work with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he sends me some samples and
whew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I was like, this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medicinal effects were on point,
aroma, flavor, everything was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That earthy is like the coffee intertwined
with the sweet cherry and forest floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just rich and robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the best cup of coffee and OG
kush you could have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being an epileptic somebody for those
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor and the aroma is one thing,
but it also has to carry a medical aspect,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because I have a lot of
neurological issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it checked all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy to grow, good yields, narcotic smoke,
but not just going to make you lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to pass out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to enjoy yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's jumped the ranks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put that one on the other side of the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got you on a pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got you on a pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, that sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted that coffee from Pacific
Northwest roots for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was one that I just.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were pretty expensive when they came
out, and it's definitely worth coming from
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: True story.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just eluded me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have time for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the cup in Michigan,
and at the time I had a fever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to wear a mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think I was going to make it,
but really, really wanted to meet a few
[SPEAKER_00]: people and wanted to snag a pack or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get to smoke with anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get to take a single dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was miserable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stood in line for the coffee pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the only pack I bought the whole
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I gave away all of my seeds,
bought a pack, got home.
[SPEAKER_00]: A month later, I go to pop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I open it up and the inside of it was just
full of confetti with no seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what is like?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just an accident with the packaging
department.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they just they just forgot to put
the seeds in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they ended up having to send me another
packet.
[SPEAKER_00]: All good in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least they did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was so sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get home and I'm like ready to pop the
seeds a little bit later after I recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look at the seeds and there's no
seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a bunch of a bunch of mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, get out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need my seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll still plant it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys have any questions,
don't forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hit that Q&A down there and
interact directly if you're a member of
[SPEAKER_01]: our Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to the Patreon gang for
supporting this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Panda, for setting this all up,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red Scare, we got a common friend there,
FarmerFly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that you were growing some of that
haze that he was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How'd that come out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very hazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it reminded me of some of the first
herb that, you know, I ever grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, it just had such a heavy
Mexican feel to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody enjoyed that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you sent us this Curvature 2.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know nothing about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I remember you talking about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you enlighten me a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some fun with Gage Green back in the
day and made a curvature pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those dudes are pretty hardcore flat
earthers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So MendoBreath crossed to GMO Fuel F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 2.0 is PugsBreath F2, which is
technically a MendoBreath F3, I believe,
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed to GMO Fuel F5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just a new version of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very limited release.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I might have released nine packs
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm all over that Loon's Calf Drop,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fighting one of you guys for that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we can get you on later as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that sponsors the show with seeds
to give away to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like them to come on during the show
and get to watch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're down for that, I'll let you know
the date later on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We either play do or dab or we do like
canna trivia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do or dab is the most famous one,
but a lot of people are afraid to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's I don't know what you
compare it to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do a challenge or you got to take a
dab or sometimes the dab is the challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a one gram dab or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these guys will just go head to head
trying to get this the free seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can't like walk away a loser
from that show because everybody's winning
[SPEAKER_00]: when one gram dabs go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're just a winner no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like Doc versus Farmer for do or
dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmer wants them too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sent me those Black Tiger NLD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know our Patreon member Big Bad John
wanted to hear a little bit more about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I acquired those from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where was the sourcing on those and did
you work it at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us a little bit more?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not worked that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't work everything you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are sourced directly from
Balochistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So direct from the farmer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it doesn't get any.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you didn't do any preservation work or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was something from your stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was from the Indian Land Race
Exchange drop two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe last year gets a little hazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had some fire drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it gets the lines get blurred
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that's one of the ones that
I wanted was their Black Tiger.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, it's like money versus how
many seeds I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm already at the point where
it's I can't grow all these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to give them away and I do all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we do auctions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of years left is strange to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you, you're really OG and you
grow a lot like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then every once in a while,
it's like I need a break.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to do haze or something a little
bit higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmer McSlaws haze was the first haze
I've grown in probably five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: True story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't grow a lot of haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the land races, the land races,
you do have to take a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get burned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you end up wanting the hype
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want some hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I just want something to look good
for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say the C word because I
don't want any cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's like you do end up
wanting some hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like somebody was talking shit about runs
and I was like, hey, runs isn't that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's in the scheme of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not it's not the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: People get, you know, kind of emphatic
about preserving things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get into your purest and
they're like, you know, fuck all the hype
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to be that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to be that guy hardcore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's room for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's room for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I've realized is I got older
even if it's a type that bag appeal is off
[SPEAKER_01]: the chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Resin producing is off the chain,
but it doesn't have a lot of flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take plants like that and mix the
traits in that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do enough work, you know,
try it with a few different things that
[SPEAKER_01]: you like that are heavy resin producers,
great highs and work it in, see what you
[SPEAKER_01]: find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the adverse of that, you can take
something that you like isn't a heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: resin producer and then cross it with
something that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, like, for example, the maroof
red, we were talking about the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the preservation and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so that's another Pakistani selection
in the AFPAC region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that they all carried was
this rotten flesh aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them had this nasty foot odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moldy cheese, dead body smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you cross them with something,
I ended up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say that again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dead body smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found this in a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swamp Boys had layer cake and a lot of the
layer cake phenos that people choose are
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of cakey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Layer cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a corpse pheno and then we
crossed that with our GMO fuel F3 back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was crude cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit was like digging up a corpse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I know what that smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I would imagine it smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to the red maroof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to the red maroof.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how gassy or nasty the strain
you hit to that maroof is, it turns it
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes directly 180 away from the dead
corpse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden you're talking guava,
passion fruit, pineapple, like star fruit,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most tropical shit you can think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden, that's that's all you're
getting anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Desert Island question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could only take one strain with you
out of anything that you made that other
[SPEAKER_01]: people have made, what would you take with
you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I'm going to go with the GMO fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think I think a Zod cashmere would
be a close second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I could take two, that would be my
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't crossed those yet either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I haven't done that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Timing is OG lover.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's surprising to hear you say
cashmere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only because maybe it's my selections
that I was lucky enough to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we we I got mine from Bear Frog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the same person that
Bodhi got his from and a few others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he gave them to three or four
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And shout out to Bear Frog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was an amazing gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got rid of every feno that smelled like
candy or Jack, wiped it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found fenos that smelled like grilled
chicken and had that like salty grilled
[SPEAKER_00]: chicken burnt aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flavor was woodsy and earthy like
an OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It it's like finding an heirloom peanut
butter breath or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like smaller buds that are just
caked in resin and the most unique
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes you could think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double serrated leaves, real sharp saw
blades, just beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard you say salty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't hear you say chicken chicken
saying it reminds you of chicken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And multiple people have found this and
worked with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's the chicken cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: We selected we selected three of them that
had different variations of grilled
[SPEAKER_00]: chicken smells and passed them in on the F
threes and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've seemed to carry that that same
trait as a dominant trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unbelievable to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is mind blowing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do another podcast called The
Washington Weed Review, and they had like
[SPEAKER_01]: the new style of moon rocks that was like
a bud rolled in THCA as opposed to like
[SPEAKER_01]: how we used to make them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was called chicken and waffles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I passed it, my wife,
she hit it first and she goes,
[SPEAKER_01]: it tastes like chicken.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, there's no fucking way you're
going to tell me that tastes like chicken.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it didn't to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're if you're dead set that this
thing tastes like chicken, I got to try
[SPEAKER_01]: that one out, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the flavor the flavor comes across
more of like earth truffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really earthy and buttery.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the aroma is chicken all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Inky Grover says what strain is on
the top for your head stash this season?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really looking forward to this wedding
fuel I've got going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a banana OG by cross is just
really standing out in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to post it up later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it was a replacement plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a plant on the back end of my
greenhouse and left the door open,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to vent things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deer walks in about twice a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time he just eats my kale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm cool with that this time of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: He comes in and wipes my plant out and
just leaves it on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, thanks, fellas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put this banana OG back there just as
a replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of spindly at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, fuck, I hate putting
replacements out, you know, it beefed up
[SPEAKER_00]: fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's it's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Must be the thing that we've been chasing
is like the banana turp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe the one that I tried was a was
flour from a cut of the banana OG from
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the same one that you worked with?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't get a lot of banana per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say that's the same with
you get a lot of banana out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But have you created something with that
that you find to be very banana?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we crossed it to Hannibal OG from
Dr. Candyman's Candyland seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's just Dr. Candyman now or
Candyman seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time he was retired, I think like
around 2015, he had made a release and
[SPEAKER_00]: then just dropped off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was lucky enough to get a few of his
packs around like 2018 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ran the banana milkshake OG and it
was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was sitting on this pack of Hannibal
OG and crop and popped in it was it was
[SPEAKER_00]: nice purple buds smell like paint thinner
and like aerosol spray, spray paint or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old Skull hairspray.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We crossed it to the banana OG,
which is also pretty musky, at least on my
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I had it, it seemed pretty musky
leather kind of but earthy OG for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we cross the two together,
you know, you're thinking muskiness,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of leather mixed with some
paint thinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're thinking more along the gas line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of the females came out like
green bananas, you know, under ripe
[SPEAKER_00]: bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many preservation jobs have you done
now?
[SPEAKER_00]: At least half a dozen, probably a dozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've probably failed triple that that
amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Landry's preservation is tricky
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the seeds are old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they, you know, get fucked up
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you get you don't know the
proper at the time technique to pop those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds like code stratification or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you just find shit that's not
worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you just get wiped the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you find plants that just don't
flower and all of a sudden you're like six
[SPEAKER_00]: months in and this plant hasn't stopped
vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something from no balls to trying to bust
balls in a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to find, you have to like draw
the line for yourself and tell yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, I'm going to be selective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to like keep a plant just
because it's cool or because I hold
[SPEAKER_00]: sentimental value or because it's from
this region or that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just have to make your cuts pretty
early on and stick by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's been some of your favorite runs
to do with a Landry's preservation?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the Afghans have been,
that's, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have the Maroof line pretty
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Maroof red, like I talked about,
the females kind of had that rotten
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies, sulfur smell, but then the males
passed on tropical fruit turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been really fun and those lines
are really fun to hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Azad Kashmir going back to it,
that's always fun and probably has made
[SPEAKER_00]: for the best out-crosses as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon member Big Bad John wants to know
what's some of your best tech for popping
[SPEAKER_01]: old seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do about a week in the fridge,
at least a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the seeds, what they are,
what do they look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the seeds really thick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some hardcore Afghans get really
thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're like stone pebbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's the case, I'm going to take them
and I'm going to scuff them really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a hydrogen peroxide solution,
probably 50-50 with water, nothing fancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, I'll pull them out
and I'm a firm believer in microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would probably just inoculate and
plant and then dome them if you need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, a lot of that depends on the
seed cracking at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that could just be me
sucking my ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've probably lost out on some genetics,
not seed cracking because I know people
[SPEAKER_00]: that have had good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it manually before, but for me,
if the seeds don't want to be viable,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just let that go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really seed crack too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured, yeah, like you, if it's not
going to pop open, let nature take its
[SPEAKER_01]: course.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do a week solution, I'll let them sit
for two or three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about the longest I'll let them
sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll pull them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't pop in there, then they're
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've pulled them out before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you can hit them with some
microbes and toss them on a heating pad
[SPEAKER_00]: and a few might pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally speaking, they're going to
be weaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've yet to do that and have a
seed just like bust out of the soil and be
[SPEAKER_00]: really vigorous and be blown away by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean I couldn't be taught new
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's obviously not the case, but I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me so long to finally go,
all right, I'm going to use an LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was just I love the HIDs,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like now that I've been growing with the
LEDs, I'm a little bit more comfortable
[SPEAKER_01]: with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do appreciate them for what they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think with following a proper VPD,
knowing your plants, knowing how to read
[SPEAKER_01]: them, I've got a little bit better yield
now with the LEDs now that they're dialed
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely get better colors without
having to do too much switching or dimming
[SPEAKER_01]: or dropping temps or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's something about those HIDs,
even though they're a pain in the ass
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes, fighting heat or doing
whatever, you know, all the duct work you
[SPEAKER_01]: had to do with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They threw off their own style of buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you could really get some hefty,
sour, decent buds with HIDs, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most things, they're just not as tight as
a lot of these LEDs are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a slightly different structure and
appearance and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell people all the time, one of my
favorite grows was interchanging HIDs with
[SPEAKER_01]: CMH between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would do like a 315 CMH between two 600
watt HIDs and or HBS, I guess I should
[SPEAKER_01]: say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking love that spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did that too?
[SPEAKER_00]: We were doing the same thing and the
spectrum was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think it could be beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still I'm not convinced it can be
beat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just being stubborn old man,
you know, when I when I first got the
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs, everybody was telling me about like
PAR and PPFD and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, man, I check with my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I can't do that with these
LEDs, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, my hand's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you crank them up and just pry
the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guilty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guilty as charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guilty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still learning with my LEDs.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you running right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of spiders at the moment
and they're going to do it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite lights is actually,
and this is really terrible for me to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of my favorite lights right now is
just a Mars bar light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's 2000 or 3000,
what model it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it from the homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came in a box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it together and it's killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just waiting until, you know,
it glitches out on me and starts coming on
[SPEAKER_00]: at night because I've had those guys send
me lights before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll go into my bedroom in the middle
of the night and the light will be
[SPEAKER_00]: flickering on and off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, God damn you, Mars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn it, Mars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a that's a personal thing with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've hit me up so many times about
sponsoring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: They harassed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God, who was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hoda Erb.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know Hoda Erb at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were harassing him forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he would post about him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, they can't be that bad,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they started harassing me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not they're not bad lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a couple of friends of mine that
are local here that really, really love
[SPEAKER_01]: the Mars Hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing about them is they do
produce a lot of heat just because of how
[SPEAKER_01]: they're built.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're great lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, it's the company that I'm like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, not all of their models are built
the same for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: After we get done with this interview,
I'll send you an invite link to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Discord server.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's dudes in there that are like
fucking science wizards with the with the
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs and really help you dial them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: My plants are fucking looking great with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmer Fly, another one of our Patreon
members and our our personal friend,
[SPEAKER_01]: says, what was your impression of the
Hopar Valley Land Race?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hopar Valley?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't finished any.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm guilty, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't finished any of the Hopar yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that what I've seen from Farmer
McFly looked amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he's got a bike cross going
right now of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw him working with that with the Hopar
and I just kind of got rid of mine and
[SPEAKER_00]: moved a different direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, personally, don't want to step
on toes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see a homie working the line,
especially using a male of something,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stray a different direction
and then just wait until he's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just going to snag some of his
crosses and run that and just get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: point, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm at the point now where I just kind
of want to run the homies crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to I want to run some of my some
people's work that have worked some of my
[SPEAKER_00]: gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm constantly getting seeds from people
who are using my lines and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, at some point it'd be cool
to just take a break and just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just not even my stuff, grow stuff that
they've produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who would you say were some of your
inspirations when it came to cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been asked this before, and this is
one of the trickiest questions for me to
[SPEAKER_00]: answer because we really didn't have any.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for us, I really I really didn't
have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it wasn't until I started breeding
later on, you know, I went a good decade
[SPEAKER_00]: without really looking up to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I guess you could say like maybe Mel
Frank or Ed Rosenthal back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot has changed since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say I look up to him now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of get to the point where you see
how the sausage is made and you stop
[SPEAKER_00]: eating sausage at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once I started breeding, it was kind
of like Bodhi seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bodhi was really cool to me coming in,
you know, encouraged me to work with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of his stuff, gifted me a lot of a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was that was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then watching, you know, just watching
my buddies kind of kind of work alongside,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, back in the old face group book
days of Delta 9 THC days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of people kind of
starting off and then you had like
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor P and dudes like that that were
in the group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was pretty open.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of open communication and
transparency that you don't get now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like Facebook kind of censored us
out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody shifted to Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Instagram is shifting and censoring
us out of Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I've been telling every breeder
that I know move to Discord like just like
[SPEAKER_01]: a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's basically how you can run
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just gather your people there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your thing on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your thing on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else is word of mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's way easier for everybody
and everybody that I've made one for,
[SPEAKER_01]: really, that becomes their spot,
you know, just like ours is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even like I said, I'll send you a link
after the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check ours out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you you can you moderate yourselves,
you know, you decide what your server is
[SPEAKER_01]: like, what you're going to handle there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just so much better having that
shit without the worry of being flagged or
[SPEAKER_01]: taken down or losing your people over
fucking night.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was I was at like 12000 plus
followers and had years worth of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, pictures archived and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then lost it all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lost it all overnight,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like getting the followers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Losing the followers wasn't a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most people can tell you that
losing track of the people you follow is a
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger deal, because even though you're
going to get some back, you're you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to lose touch with the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's always shitty, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for joining me,
Red Scare.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for donating the
curvature, the GMO fuel and the Ludens
[SPEAKER_01]: cough drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been an amazing episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys have any more questions,
don't hesitate to get them in because
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got about 10 minutes left here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I want to thank you again so
much for taking this time out with us to
[SPEAKER_01]: tell us a little bit about yourself and
what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any cultivars that you're looking
to work that you haven't got to work yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's tricky, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You threw one at me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, curveball.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few things going now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of digging into some like
straight away from citrus for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's just to me, it's vile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some people like grapefruit and
they like to smoke the grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's like repulsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But recently I've been I've been finding
that like if it's in in a cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like a few generations back,
you know, if it's a second cousin twice
[SPEAKER_00]: removed, it can do nice things for the
palate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've kind of been digging into some
stuff, you know, some citrus type stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's that's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some, let's see, kind of going
like back and forth on a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some caramel grape donuts from
the homey, the real mint blunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be interesting to kind
of see what what that does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep shutting out as Farmer McFly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like ISMW88.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmer McFly from now on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a back to the future thing with my
son.
[SPEAKER_00]: He always thinks he's like Marty McFly or
some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really just looking forward to growing
the homies work.
[SPEAKER_00]: 305 genetics, dude, dude out of Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like really under the radar looking
to grow some of his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just small, small time guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, if you decide you want to do some
more land race selection again,
[SPEAKER_01]: let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I've got some that you need,
I'd be more than happy to share with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: All this information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmer McFly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't do that to you, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You already did, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on a first name level with him or it'd
be embarrassing, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I'm with you, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you so much for the for the
narrow leaves, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really cannot wait to grow those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are some amazing seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: The 21 Himalayan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Book from Full Power.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got that one as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you go through any of those?
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through some.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still kind of going through some.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a comprehensive drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which ones did you go through?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried a few more than once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, I've learned some
lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still stuck in Molana at the moment or
Melana at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just lost a crop of Polama Pink
repeatedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I put the plants out again and
the cuts out, I lost my cuts, lost the
[SPEAKER_00]: backup cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The deer will do anything for these Polama
Pink, this Himalayan strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen anything like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look like a dude that hunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, Erasinardi F2 that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's locked down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to going through those
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to I'm going to message you
about some of those Ludens cough drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be more than happy to support your
business and lift you up, especially for
[SPEAKER_01]: taking this time with all of us to tell us
about Red Scare.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we got one more thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, I forgot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we talk about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red Scare is going to be rebranding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to talk more about that,
man?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the new name and why the rebrand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been something I've thought
about for a little over a year now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new name is Garden Goblin Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it's kind of an inside joke
between me and some King Gizzard fans,
[SPEAKER_00]: King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard shout
out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we're just, you know,
if you if you look into the Garden Goblin,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will see some more, but it just
provides some different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different marketability, a different vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to stray away from the militant
vibe of RSC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of see the badge or the or the
stamp, and it's it's just something I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: moving on from for the time being.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to say I won't revisit that,
you know, somewhere down the line in a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years, but it's time to move on from that
side of things and kind of kind of open
[SPEAKER_00]: things up artistically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm an artist and I know a bunch
of artists and I don't want to pigeonhole
[SPEAKER_00]: them with red and black and yellow colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it's fucking lame.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't McDonald's.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it is, I would go there every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before before this name change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's going through a rebranding,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys are going to get some of the
last packs here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Red Scare seed company name.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also sent us these and these are actual
wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is going to come with each pack
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, shout out to Cultivated Laser for
making those.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also bred some amazing gear back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: A dude needs to get back in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they, stickers?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you peel the back off and they'll
actually last quite a quite a while on a
[SPEAKER_00]: car.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using color, but his lasted a year on a
car, so that's really cool, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm going to I'm going to be
fighting somebody for the Ludens cough
[SPEAKER_01]: drop, and then I'm going to be buying like
four more packs off if you got them.
And.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, where can people find your seeds
if they want to acquire some at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Red Scare seed company dot com or find me
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red Scare Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Green, I guess you can look that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red Scare Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.0 and I think Gobble Garden Genetics is
my new page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, follow the back up as well,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red Scare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome interview, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on testing really
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, testing was, you know, it's not for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like tested gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of requests for untested gear,
so you'll see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me oftentimes release packs temporarily
for like twenty dollars a pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people want to buy them and stash them
and not test them right away, they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're untested and are typically so
to such.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I like untested gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost grow exclusively untested gear,
probably because I'm getting so many seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: sent to me from so many of my friends that
I just pop them with faith that you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the guys growing them and breeding
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I trust I trust the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next time, guys, this has been Doc
Callix with Dr. Green Sky of Red Scare
[SPEAKER_01]: Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: and now Garden Goblin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's give them a big shout out round of
applause.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.
