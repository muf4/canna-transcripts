[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, what's up everybody good
evening and welcome to another exciting
[SPEAKER_02]: episode of the Calix crew podcast We are
joined by our good friend today the clone
[SPEAKER_02]: coach.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good You're going to be smoking with
us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna be talking about keeping
healthy mothers keeping healthy clones I
[SPEAKER_02]: know you were interested in Some of what I
was doing as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think plenty of people that are joining
us over here and chat Have you know had
[SPEAKER_02]: problems with their clones and are looking
for tips and advice on how to keep Healthy
[SPEAKER_02]: clones and get successful rate Throughout
their cloning and I think the big thing
[SPEAKER_02]: about that is You need to start a good if
you're gonna have a good house.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to build it on a good foundation,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, which would include keeping a
healthy mother You're very experienced in
[SPEAKER_02]: this if you guys aren't familiar with the
clone coach, you can go catch him over at
[SPEAKER_02]: clone coach calm He actually does
consulting over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that you were doing 50 clones per
tray What's your average tray amount?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you ranging between these
different consultations you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's for concoach calm.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a coaching program So I try to do
this as remote as possible so I can help
[SPEAKER_01]: as many gardens as possible, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's different Coaching programs for
clones and mother plants and then if you
[SPEAKER_01]: really want to get in depth and you're
doing commercial scale stuff There's an
[SPEAKER_01]: on-site option as well, but there's two
guides come with a PDF of video Training
[SPEAKER_01]: video and a one-on-one coaching call with
me like this So that really covers should
[SPEAKER_01]: cover a hundred percent of everything you
need to solve all the clone problems
[SPEAKER_01]: You're having and get you the best clones
ever same thing with the mother plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little package PDF document a
training video in a one-on-one coaching
[SPEAKER_02]: call Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome, man So like we were saying,
you know all those cuts to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: successful rate Most of my growers are
home growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a little bit smaller scale But you
know if you're keeping hundreds of
[SPEAKER_02]: literally hundreds of cuts just between a
couple trays In a commercial setting it
[SPEAKER_02]: should be more than easily possible to get
four or five good cuts off a mother in a
[SPEAKER_02]: home grow situation But a big part of that
is having a healthy mother and I think
[SPEAKER_02]: more often than not home growers Skip that
fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have their mother in perfect
health before they take those cuts and
[SPEAKER_02]: that that's kind of like a Setup for not
for having bad success, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: 100% I mean it I Started as a home grower,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I started with the small with the small
bedroom and before that was a closet with
[SPEAKER_01]: some plants in it You know for a mother
plant specifically you could have a small
[SPEAKER_01]: closet have one mother plant and one tray
of clones that you could root right next
[SPEAKER_01]: to it keeping things very Simple and get
get success, right and that one mother
[SPEAKER_01]: plant if it's in a little two by four
little closet area You should be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: get oh probably a couple dozen clones off
of that on a really consistent basis and I
[SPEAKER_01]: say clones where they're just all tops and
Real uniform in the growth, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So uniform in the tray uniform and veg
uniform and flour so on and so forth but a
[SPEAKER_01]: little two by four Man, you could you
know, probably do 50 clones a month off
[SPEAKER_01]: that space keeping it very small But as
long as you keep it simple keep things as
[SPEAKER_01]: steady as you can wherever you could
maintain your parameters as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity and temperature This is I'd
rather have consistency and play with that
[SPEAKER_01]: than have irregularities and
unpredictability in your room environment
[SPEAKER_01]: so keep it simple keep it steady and You
know, you'll get plenty of vegetative
[SPEAKER_01]: growth clone them root them and you know
share them with friends Fuck yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to back it up a little bit I want
these guys to get a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: familiar with you How did you get into
cannabis and how did you go from that
[SPEAKER_02]: first experience with cannabis to becoming
a clone goat?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean we're talking be third.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just turned 34 so that is 16 years
without counting my minor years as a
[SPEAKER_01]: journey right because you know as a minor
I was consuming cannabis and because I
[SPEAKER_01]: became an advocate for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was I was that guy in the family,
right, you know That that was me,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know late teens going into you know 18
I got my medical card here in California
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've been a patient ever since right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an advocate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a patient through and through and
Earlier on, you know, I didn't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to like there was no commercial
facilities that I was able to like work at
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, I had the desire to to
cultivate, you know did the collective
[SPEAKER_01]: thing cultivated that way and stuff here
and there but really grew that into when
[SPEAKER_01]: 2016 hit like 2015 hit I left my corporate
job because I just couldn't ignore the
[SPEAKER_01]: desire to to cultivate and and you know,
give my all to this plant really and You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, I made that a switch, you know,
I turned a spare bedroom into a little
[SPEAKER_01]: nursery and I was back up one quick step.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to you know garden,
you know make a garden, you know cause we
[SPEAKER_01]: had a little room, but when it came time
to get plants to fill the room get clones
[SPEAKER_01]: to fill the room was where I got stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't find a dependable consistent
source of good clones so I could plant a
[SPEAKER_01]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my first struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I did my first room I was able to
finally source genetics and clones and
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of flipping them to flour I said
look I'm just gonna fill that need because
[SPEAKER_01]: I had that need and I you know took my
first tray of clones and turned a spare
[SPEAKER_01]: bedroom throw up a few lights and and just
was off to the races applying the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries and medical collectives out
here in the area and then 2018 hit
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational came to California and I
started working at a recreational facility
[SPEAKER_01]: huge license commercial grows started
popping up here in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like I dove head into there and
I've done brokering with sales for clones
[SPEAKER_01]: for different nurseries and stuff,
but it's always been nurseries.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's clones nurseries mother plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I've maintained the focus
throughout the whole cultivation career
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've had you know up until now and
just to quickly sum it up so now it's you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, I've always had a good desire to
help people and you know, I was turning
[SPEAKER_01]: around nurseries that I was you know
managing I'll take him from point A to
[SPEAKER_01]: point B and point B was a lot better than
point A and you know turning these
[SPEAKER_01]: nurseries around and I wanted to help more
nurseries and the one I was just working
[SPEAKER_01]: at so I started helping friends that were
remote, you know I would send in some info
[SPEAKER_01]: at help on the phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I send him emails I would you know do
everything kind of just just scattered
[SPEAKER_01]: around until I finally kind of packaged it
up and said, you know, let's let's see if
[SPEAKER_01]: this really helps people with this package
that created and it's it's been working
[SPEAKER_01]: people all over the world are getting
results with this package with the
[SPEAKER_01]: coaching call, you know, and now we're
really changing the standard of what we
[SPEAKER_01]: accept as like viable clones like no more
little sick purple yellow little baby
[SPEAKER_01]: clones that you need to spend another two
weeks to tenderly bring them back to
[SPEAKER_01]: health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's a quick the quick journey
of the last, you know, 16 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know playing with this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm glad you brought up that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was saying, you know, you have to
have that healthy foundation, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big problem that a lot of people
have with their clones is that wilting
[SPEAKER_02]: that purpling the yellowing and rotting
tips, you know, that's a big problem that
people have with their clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do see that more often than not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find that that's due to either just
water in the shit out of them thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: that they need water fucking constantly to
the point where they don't get air or just
[SPEAKER_02]: too high humidity levels in general
without that air exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually the coupling of those two is where
I see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's been your experience with the the
yellowing the rotting tips?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean if that's happening in your
clones, it's if you're getting rotting
[SPEAKER_01]: fuzziness Damping off mold things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have excess humidity and it's a very
common problem It's like it's like over
[SPEAKER_01]: watering your your vegetative plants or
your flowering plants You could have too
[SPEAKER_01]: much humidity in your clone domes and your
clones for too long and that leads to
[SPEAKER_01]: problems so a huge tip that I could give
the people Is just let the plants breathe
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them breathe don't trap that humidity
that stagnant stale humid air on These
[SPEAKER_01]: clones for days and days and days on end
if you just eliminated that out of your
[SPEAKER_01]: process You let these clones breathe a bit
more You'll have you'll you'll eliminate,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know good chunk of those problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just mentioned so a very common thing
is just like too much humidity for too
[SPEAKER_01]: long that and if you combine that with a
little bit cooler temperatures like in the
[SPEAKER_01]: low 70s Recipe for for for disaster recipe
for issues recipe for extending your
[SPEAKER_01]: rooting time recipe for all the above
really Yeah, I think you and I kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: came around the same era with the HPS and
CMH kind of being like the new thing Wow,
[SPEAKER_02]: these are pretty cool, you know Now
there's LEDs are dominating the fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well when it came to the LED switch
They're so efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're often running lower power Which
results in lower temperatures?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something that should have been
brought up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm glad you mentioned that Our patreon
member prod Eddie wants to know what is
[SPEAKER_02]: the optimal temp and humidity?
[SPEAKER_02]: I run mine like low 80s high 70s And I
don't think I ever surpassed like 70% on
[SPEAKER_02]: my RH.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if those are your parameters,
that's that's spot-on it's real good
[SPEAKER_01]: advice If you could maintain a steady
environment shoot for 80 degrees If you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to deal with a little bit of a swing,
you know Try to see what side of the swing
[SPEAKER_01]: is better for you, right a little bit
warmer rather than a little bit cooler,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: With humidity if you're capped at 70% like
that's a max that your room hits.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's great You know shoot for 65
60, you know You don't want to be 40s and
[SPEAKER_01]: 50s because then it's you're too dry and
you're really gonna do Readjust your whole
[SPEAKER_01]: dome protocol to compensate for that lack
of humidity there But even if you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more humid and you stay at 70
As long as your room could breathe if you
[SPEAKER_01]: treat your room like a dome like one big
dome and let that air exchange happen
[SPEAKER_01]: without days and days and days of trapping
that humid stagnant air humidifiers
[SPEAKER_01]: pumping and If you just let it breathe,
you'll be able to you know, deal with a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more consistent higher humidity
as well Good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is some of your favorite methods for
cloning?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had growers that are I've personally
have used the hydro cloner I've cloned
[SPEAKER_02]: directly into soil before that's actually
one of my favorite ways just because for
[SPEAKER_02]: the home growers cheap easy And if you got
your you know, you got everything in line,
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll happen for you with pretty good
success rates But I've done that I've done
[SPEAKER_02]: those though, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Rapid router keeps I have used the
Rockwell I wasn't crazy about the
[SPEAKER_02]: Rockwell, but I wanted to know a little
Bit about what your preferred method is.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you seeing the best success with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, it's a little bit different
grower per situation per situation,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the man himself Let's hear let's hear
your little thing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously you can't give us a secret sauce
But yeah, I mean my favorite versus what's
[SPEAKER_01]: the best are two different answers I would
I would probably say right off the bat,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, but you know my favorite I like
You know any like 50 You know clones per
[SPEAKER_01]: tray that's that's a good solid number for
me But in the tray mediums, you know root
[SPEAKER_01]: riots work good I mean you could always
root in a root, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing I don't like it's like it's
a little bit inconsistent in the holes But
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, you'll get that thing to root.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But the the insert trays as long as
there's a little bit of a gap between the
[SPEAKER_01]: insert tray and the solid tray in the
bottom I really prefer that because then
[SPEAKER_01]: you could really get these huge noodles of
roots Hanging out in that inch of space
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's just enough humidity and
moisture where those roots can grow kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of waking it up Untouched the up and
that's how you get those really big like
[SPEAKER_01]: chunky You know squared out roots of you
know inch work down the cube.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some gap in there That's my
favorite because visually when you lift
[SPEAKER_01]: that tray It's just noodles everywhere,
you know good point with the roots hanging
[SPEAKER_02]: down the secondary tray How I like to do
it If I'm gonna go that route is the
[SPEAKER_02]: little ridges at the bottom of them I keep
that Like fold to the top with my nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: water, but I don't really let it go above
those higher ridges Just so the moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: is there but it's not That they're not
sitting in a pool of water, you know and
[SPEAKER_02]: that Probably gets changed every day if
not every other day You know life happens,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but yeah Leave in a little bit
of nutrient solution at the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_01]: tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love doing that, too I only have to you
know, usually do it And like the last
[SPEAKER_01]: third of the rooting process, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the very end of the rooting process
the last You know three or four days of
[SPEAKER_01]: the rooting process is where I'll
potentially start leaving nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: solution for me Yeah, just start
acclimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and then if they're ready Like
they're already switching a veg then hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I want to give them more nudes more
light Do you know make them use that that
[SPEAKER_01]: root system that I'm building up?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that trick and that's really how
you get those Long spaghetti noodles that
[SPEAKER_01]: are you know that lift up and super long
because they're hanging out a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of nutrient solution So is there anything
that we can do?
[SPEAKER_02]: To our mothers to kind of prep them for
more successful clone Just make sure She's
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it Like that's number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that you know The plant is
vibrant enough that it's transpiring
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to where it's drinking the
nutrients on a consistent basis,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's up taking that water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not being come bogged down that root
zone is really healthy and active You have
[SPEAKER_01]: that good balance of light to where it
could veg out enough and as long as she's
[SPEAKER_01]: green and happy and praying and Eager for
that next watering right like it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: vibrant plant That's that's what you
should do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter what nutrients Brand you
use doesn't matter what just a healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: plant do that follow some simple recipes
some simple additives Keep it real simple,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know and just make sure that plant is
thriving and that's how you really prepare
[SPEAKER_01]: for a good cloning session is just having
the healthiest plant you can and if you
[SPEAKER_01]: want like specifics, I usually Allow two
weeks of growth before a clone So two
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks of uninterrupted growth and then
clone if you're gonna keep vegetating
[SPEAKER_01]: After that then you would need a prune and
time it to where like two weeks before
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna clone is where you just leave
it untouched Let's go a little more
[SPEAKER_02]: detailed into the actual clones themselves
because I believe I was looking at your
[SPEAKER_02]: stories a little while back and It made me
laugh at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me really happy for you when you
did your experiment with your shorties the
[SPEAKER_02]: little clones in there I Was always taught
take a healthy size clone the more Nodes
[SPEAKER_02]: you have the more auxins your you have the
more rooting hormone you have So it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really cool to see you getting these
entire flats of these little tiny shorties
[SPEAKER_02]: and shit like that and at the same time I
Was watching that and retaining something
[SPEAKER_02]: else that I had seen on your page Before
that and it was that you didn't use clone
[SPEAKER_02]: X you you weren't a fan of clone X What
route what rooting hormone what rooting
[SPEAKER_02]: practice are you using?
[SPEAKER_01]: I Think you may have gotten that mistake
and I did do I do like clone X gel Okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the clone X solution or you
know I don't need to clone X solutions,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know for my soaking a mess beating
Yeah, the mist or the solution but the gel
[SPEAKER_01]: is what I you know do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay Joe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah So that is your oh then that's what
you were using in the ketchup bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome Yeah, by the way, that's love
coolest fucking hack I've ever seen you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, man Those shorties and that ketchup
bottle tech once again, I was managing a
[SPEAKER_01]: nursery, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was you know from sales production to
build out the design the you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the the plants everything and You know the
shorties came about from you know The
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy plants gonna give off roots no
matter what so the level of auxins and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that you mentioned in my head As
long as that plants healthy through and
[SPEAKER_01]: through wherever I cut it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll it'll root.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll want to root it'll need to root,
you know So those shorties came about from
[SPEAKER_01]: like needing extra revenue like hey,
how can we you know juice things up in a
[SPEAKER_01]: nursery?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, well, we're throwing away all
of this material all these nodes that we
[SPEAKER_01]: trim off these stems just green waste,
right we were paying for that to get
[SPEAKER_01]: picked up and you know from from trash to
cash with those shorties man, it was just
[SPEAKER_01]: and Because the consistency is there for
these side nodes as well like you'll find
[SPEAKER_01]: a little rhythm or pattern on your canopy
We're like you'll have this size shorties.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have this size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, maybe don't plug these all of them
this size plug them up, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was the same process and you know,
those little shorties are Shoot man if
[SPEAKER_02]: they're healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely And I think that's a big
part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think me without knowing or recognizing
it I think that was a big part of my lack
[SPEAKER_02]: of success with the short clones was
because I was usually taking ones lower
[SPEAKER_02]: down on the plant that just weren't as
healthy as that canopy they weren't
[SPEAKER_02]: getting as much light they were Really
stubby, you know, so kind of going in they
[SPEAKER_02]: were a little bit sub part of my even
canopy I was known for doing like multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: tops flattening things out So everything
just was kind of lackluster underneath and
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was kind of incriminating
before the get-go But that that leads into
[SPEAKER_02]: a good question as well is the location of
your clones I believe that you said you
[SPEAKER_01]: like to do tops Yeah, well, yes tops for
the consistency in the trays and the
[SPEAKER_01]: consistency that passes on to the
vegetative state and the flowering room,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know when I've always managed my
nurseries, it was always you know
[SPEAKER_01]: Nurseries for sale, you know stock for
sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was providing other cultivators their
stock So I had to provide a consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: product that was number one So that's you
get that with that uninterrupted growth at
[SPEAKER_01]: an even, you know starting with an even
flat canopy uninterrupted Growth for 14
[SPEAKER_01]: days you'll get all even clones from the
same size same amount of light that they
[SPEAKER_01]: got the whole time so and so forth That's
where you I like You know taking mom stuck
[SPEAKER_01]: off that next like B or C level stuff that
the canopy you're leaving behind There's
[SPEAKER_01]: nodes there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's clones there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's you know branches you could cut
and root but those are B and C grade,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're starting to play with
that so You know, you'll get at max B or C
[SPEAKER_01]: grade Coming out, you know So I tried to
keep at the top, you know, the bottoms are
[SPEAKER_01]: just like if you got to keep the genetic
alive or whatever But it's not good
[SPEAKER_01]: practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm with you on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I didn't even ask you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you smoking over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh I think this is a little melon og Melon
og yeah, what's your typical favorite kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of flower?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what kind of you into the fruity
stuff the sour Is the hazes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh You know if I could still get good haze
like some super silver haze or something I
[SPEAKER_01]: used to get back in the day man I would
bless that person Yeah, I like yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I like I like stuff that keeps me working,
you know, I'm a smoker and a worker,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's I kind of get in the zone
and just You know get get in my you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like putt like I got like a writer
puffing cigarettes and drinking coffee or
[SPEAKER_01]: something You know, I'm fucking puffing
joints So anything that keeps me that
[SPEAKER_01]: career You know kind of sharp and then the
complete opposite as well, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's just like behind the eyes
You know just brings you down and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: just like alright time to relax,
you know, so Accomplishes is those two
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrums, you know Good flower on top of
anything as long as it's burning good
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking good tasting good Then that's what
I'm more concerned about then I could kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of pick and choose from there really,
you know So with what I do I'm more K&F
[SPEAKER_02]: specific We've got growers all around the
world that are doing synthetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing commercial and homegrown So
on the homegrown scale I do more of like a
[SPEAKER_02]: no till on K&F type style practice So
we're usually using organic natural
[SPEAKER_02]: products and I really like using aloe and
kelp To help promote my clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you do anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I am like a true believer in both of
those things right and so the journey is
[SPEAKER_01]: You know finding the best quality and a
best source and the best producer of those
[SPEAKER_01]: active ingredients That so yeah hundred
percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do more experiments with organic
cloning, you know with With like a full
[SPEAKER_01]: organic line, you know I've rooted in like
loose cocoa right that's pre-charged with
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients So some people that I've reached
out to me Like hey, you know, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: organic growers and like how do you
suggest I do it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't just mix up, you know some liquid
nutrients and Put that into you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: my cubes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've just suggested them to try it
Yeah, we'll get the same kind of soil
[SPEAKER_01]: that's still active at the plant came from
it's getting the same food That is a real
[SPEAKER_01]: theory behind it gets the same food So as
it roots it'll root right into the same
[SPEAKER_01]: food So all we got to do is initiate
rooting the aloe and the temperature and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff the humidity and then once it hits
That it was already feeding that and it
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't too much and it was happy then That
moist media and that extra humidity and
[SPEAKER_01]: the root striking should keep the momentum
at the same pace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that What do you what do you think
about like using the same soil that you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, it's already that's what I do
typically Yeah, I use those root guide the
[SPEAKER_02]: first time I ever attempted cloning I did
of rock wool and I was I never I've never
[SPEAKER_02]: done synthetic I've done synthetic Organic
nutrients, but I've never done a synthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that just like bottled organic stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was I think it was like an
eight-part system from roots organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was too many fucking balls to be Doing
that was the old norm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not in the norm anymore, you know,
let's know You know secrets out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean 50% of secrets out And then I after
that I had moved to the root riots Or
[SPEAKER_02]: rapid Rooters kind of those
interchangeably, but I had the same
[SPEAKER_02]: problem that you mentioned I was really I
got irritated about the inconsistency of
[SPEAKER_02]: the holes on one you'd have one that was a
perfect size maybe even five in a row and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you'd have one that was barely in
there and then you try to open it up and
[SPEAKER_01]: you just rip the Cube and it's just not
viable enough to where you could pierce it
[SPEAKER_01]: with the stem, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right so much resistance and like you
couldn't just pierce a new hole like you
[SPEAKER_01]: could even with Rockwell You can make any
80% of the time with Rockwell 70% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: time because there are those little hard
spots, you know that you hit every now and
[SPEAKER_02]: again So there was this point where we
were Let's say this was early 2010s.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were getting really in heavy with
hunting Thai land races and one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Thai land races or there's a certain
region about that Burma Myanmar border
[SPEAKER_02]: where they Have a certain type of plant
that they call a creeper and the humidity
[SPEAKER_02]: is so high there that the lower branches
will actually touch the ground they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: start rooting to the ground and Then
they'll just keep going on you can cut
[SPEAKER_02]: them right there disconnect them and
they're their own clone You know just
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally like that if you don't I was
like we'll just become a stronger base of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant Exactly, and I'm just like so if
they can do this in nature if they've got
[SPEAKER_02]: enough rooting hormone because they are
healthy outdoor plants that get whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: they Need in this humid humic environment
Why can't I do the same thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I basically took the exact same
practices Which it sounds like you and I
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of cloned similar, you know within
similar conditions and everything I was
[SPEAKER_02]: utilizing the same practice but I Started
using my soil instead and it started off
[SPEAKER_02]: using like solo cups and then I put a
little hole in there You know same same
[SPEAKER_02]: idea Pre-moistening all my medium before
doing it And then I would just take like a
[SPEAKER_02]: ziplock bag or something and put it over
the top and tape it on You know as a
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity dome after a couple days I would
cut one corner of the bag a couple days
[SPEAKER_02]: later I cut the other corner of the bag
and just you know increase that airflow
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was getting a hundred percent
success and I wasn't having problems I was
[SPEAKER_02]: like what the hell I had a couple that
died and they had like that dampening Off
[SPEAKER_02]: around the end there, you know roots
rotting, whatever So I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, we got to open up a little bit more
airflow on the root zone So it started off
[SPEAKER_02]: with just mixing some more rice holes in
with it and aerating it more It doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: need as much nutrition at that point,
but it doesn't need nutrition So I added
[SPEAKER_02]: some more rice holes and I got a little
bit better better Process with that one
[SPEAKER_02]: and then what I ended up my favorite thing
to do is take like a little small soil
[SPEAKER_02]: blocker same Thing add a little bit more
rice holes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's more aeration, but then I'll
take a soil blocker, which is like a look
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen one?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a blocker?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's called a soil blocker.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little tool where you can reach
into your your soil there It's like this
[SPEAKER_02]: size of a square tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get like a one by one or two by
two square They'll do four at a time and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you just clench it together and it'll
pack that soil together in a square almost
[SPEAKER_02]: like a Rock wool cube like that type of
size and then you just A little hole in
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I have seen that I have seen that a
commercial nursery productions have that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a tool I have a loose bad a soil just
boom scoop it pack it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a you know, 12 by 12 or whatever
comes out of the whatever Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then just suck it the same way,
you know and keep the ridges at the bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: with a little bit of moisture in them I do
great with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, look man when it comes to cloning
All we're doing is initiating rooting
[SPEAKER_01]: right the plants gonna want to root it has
hormones in it That tell it to root you
[SPEAKER_01]: you supplement those same hormones to
encourage rooting you initiate the rooting
[SPEAKER_01]: process But once you start rooting You're
switching right back into the vegetative
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just right back to where it was
before just growing in a veg You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's that's it, you know week of rooting
a week of veg plan is ready clone is ready
[SPEAKER_01]: if you just You know take it a step back
and like how you did it, you know fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: rudimentary with a ziplock, you know,
but you You were accomplishing that and
[SPEAKER_01]: you got success, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants gonna want to do those natural
gonna take those steps naturally,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so yeah, man, it's it's I I'm
glad we're on the same page there with
[SPEAKER_01]: like just using the same medium of The
plants at the mother the mother plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: an organic situation, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, and I haven't used I did use the
clone X in the rock wool I use them in the
[SPEAKER_02]: end in the Rapid Rooters as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I started moving to my soil I
wanted I just kind of I'm a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: a hippie and I wanted to get it as organic
as possible so I started taking something
[SPEAKER_02]: that gas told me and that was taking
fillets off my aloe plant and Dipping them
[SPEAKER_02]: dipping my clone straight into that aloe
to get Yeah, right same thing or doing a
[SPEAKER_02]: full years with kelp and root drenches
with kelp and things like this I was under
[SPEAKER_02]: the impression that you ran Heavy
synthetic nutrients in most of your growth
[SPEAKER_01]: as a base nutrient I do I do run the the
base MPK with just you know, a simple
[SPEAKER_01]: two-part, you know synthetic nutrient but
the bigger piece of a healthy plant are
[SPEAKER_01]: all the bio stimulants and nine times out
of ten their organic bio stimulants like
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what makes a really healthy plant,
you know for me like it's it's always been
[SPEAKER_01]: like You know cocoa and you know bottled
base nutrients and then organic bio
[SPEAKER_01]: stimulants and that right environment
right light that gives me a healthy happy
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, you know So I mean, but I'm right
there with you man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's if you could have the
organic covering your bases Then bio
[SPEAKER_01]: Simmons don't change Right if you got your
MPK covered the bio stimulants don't
[SPEAKER_01]: change the plant wants all those natural
healthy things.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: The use of microbe inoculations with with
hydro synthetic growth It's one thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: I say I won't grow without Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you feel about the people that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Say that the salt based synthetic
nutrients are killing off these microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what salt nutrients do Right
microbes and beneficial fungi and
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial bacteria that are active in
your root zone could only get killed by a
[SPEAKER_01]: fungicide or You know something like that
that kills fungus and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what kills it whether that's a
chemical fungicide Is usually the case
[SPEAKER_01]: right where that would kill off your
microbes, but salt based nutrients are
[SPEAKER_01]: just providing exactly what's in them
right that the nitrogen phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium copper sulfur, you know all the
micronutrients As a base and that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: MPK value, but you know, it's not a
fungicide, you know, and it's chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature, so it won't kill off any
beneficial fungi Very cool Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's something I've always Appreciate
being able to talk about because I'm nor
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not one of those new no-till guys It's
like oh man organics all the way you're
[SPEAKER_02]: the devil if you I've got growers all
around the world that do every kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: growing and I ask personally out of
Curiosity because I have not got to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: in that way I haven't grown in your way
with the with the other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I I'm curious to man because this
plants an amazing thing right like so the
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs that it receives and we provide it
like that's What drives a curiosity were
[SPEAKER_01]: like because that drives different results
and you know for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: A healthy plant is undeniable like I don't
have to tell you I'm gonna show you and
[SPEAKER_01]: you just see it and the plant will tell
you that it's fucking yeah You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so healthy is healthy healthy is
undeniable Absolutely, I think I had my
[SPEAKER_02]: biggest wake-up call Back in the days when
we had to hide our growing shit like that
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at a local nursery and I was still
into soil building at that time I was
[SPEAKER_02]: doing super soils and pre mixing
everything and I was I was looking at some
[SPEAKER_02]: amendments and the guy from the store
comes up to me he goes what can I help you
[SPEAKER_02]: with and he goes I don't know what it was
at this time, but he started pointing out
[SPEAKER_02]: a synthetic nutrient I was like,
oh no, I don't I don't use anything like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really strictly organic and everything
he goes Well, everything on this earth
[SPEAKER_02]: comes from something Because was so all
these salt-based nutrients are made out of
[SPEAKER_02]: organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just raw real They might be lab
created but they're created from something
[SPEAKER_02]: that was of this earth It just opened my
eyes where I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you got a point there man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right Those are just elements,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's elements And nutrients like
that's what we're going after right where
[SPEAKER_01]: we need the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need the same minerals like That's
that's that's funny man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I'm gonna borrow that I'm gonna use that
if I can remember it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Something else that I saw that you
had suggested earlier Really intrigued me
[SPEAKER_02]: because I've never not done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you you don't scrape your clones you
don't split the stems I Don't
[SPEAKER_01]: but I Have and I've definitely done it but
for me it's always been you know helping
[SPEAKER_01]: others and managing crews and teams to
execute certain steps and Get certain
[SPEAKER_01]: consistency out of the out of the
production of the nursery stock,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know So I wouldn't implement it
because everybody's scrape is a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tissue is different on the clone So
how many layers how deep those layers are?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know those those slices become very
inconsistent and You don't need them to
[SPEAKER_01]: make roots, you know clean simple cut in
the right environment You'll strike roots
[SPEAKER_01]: from the whole inch the bottom inch of a
sim, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you you also don't you don't need it
to gain the success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it bad?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will it hurt you?
[SPEAKER_01]: No No, well if you could do it and you
could you know keep everything as
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent as you can with your slices and
cuts and scrapes then Yeah, there's really
[SPEAKER_01]: no harm in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just for like Scaling up and managing
people then I like to avoid it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know at that level What do you use to
cut your clones?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you use to sterilize those
tools?
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to use razor blades single-sided
razor blades Then Chikamasa scissors were
[SPEAKER_01]: always classic clean cut, you know made a
clean cut That's to cut the stock off of
[SPEAKER_01]: the mother plants and then I'd always use
either razor blade or scalpel to do the
[SPEAKER_01]: final slice where I'm Measuring the clone
on them on a measuring mat cutting mat
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting board So make them all the same
size make the 45 degree cut all the same
[SPEAKER_01]: size of the stem That's usually with the
scalpel And then yeah, man, you know 10%
[SPEAKER_01]: bleach is always gonna work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always gonna work as far as
disinfection And it's and it's usually
[SPEAKER_01]: always handy in the cheapest option.
[SPEAKER_01]: So clean not RO water I wouldn't say mix
RO water with the bleach, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just get some filter tap water or RO
That's topped off with some tap water And
[SPEAKER_01]: make your 10% bleach solution to dip your
tools and your blades in you know That'll
[SPEAKER_01]: get you as much protection, you know as
you could could desire our patreon member
[SPEAKER_02]: twist says Any tips on taking clones after
flower?
[SPEAKER_02]: I recently took five clones from a
flowering plant and I'm wondering if I
[SPEAKER_01]: should be doing anything special So I have
not so much experience with this firsthand
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of experience with the second hand
and I've seen a lot of people just you
[SPEAKER_01]: know get success with it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that plant at a certain stage
kind of depends on when in flower because
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen stuff like before harvest get
cloned and You'll they're obviously more
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitive to humidity So, you know that
that nug and that moisture is already made
[SPEAKER_01]: up of you know, 70% 80% moisture So just
anything special watch that moisture,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know on that foliage on those buds And
just treat it the same treat treat the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots the same, you know We shouldn't
strike roots and encourage rooting and
[SPEAKER_01]: then take it right back to you know this
vegetative growth I Wouldn't say it's
[SPEAKER_02]: ideal to go to a revenge it's definitely I
Do it quite often with my phenol hunts
[SPEAKER_02]: just because it's a little bit faster need
Easier for me to find that genetic that I
[SPEAKER_02]: like and go back to it Which brings me
into something else I wanted to ask you
[SPEAKER_02]: Which might be a little bit different for
rec in commercial?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a hundred percent sure but how do
you feel about seed mothers versus clone
[SPEAKER_02]: mother?
[SPEAKER_01]: I Would prefer them if you have the
ability to choose the right Plant to make
[SPEAKER_01]: mother stock from that's from seed,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A mother's mother stock whether it's from
cedar clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be a proven genetic should be
something that's proven Trustworthy,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you want to duplicate it over
and over again, you know But if we have
[SPEAKER_01]: the ability to get seed stock and choose
your mother from that You always get man.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing like a seed right a real
healthy seeds gonna be super vigorous You
[SPEAKER_01]: give it all the inputs just you'll
probably get some Jurassic-sized looking
[SPEAKER_01]: fan leaves just a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just crazy thriving, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So 100% if you could do seeds and find
that right when you want to make a mother
[SPEAKER_01]: out of Yeah, it's a way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any difference?
[SPEAKER_02]: Between the time that you would keep a
seed mother around in the time you take
[SPEAKER_01]: keep a clone mother around No,
but I guess a seed mother would have more
[SPEAKER_01]: of a longer life just because of the early
stage of the seedling and Then slow and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that extra time that gets added You
know would probably be the only Okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: so you're not seeing any any weakening in
the genetics going on from a seed mother
[SPEAKER_02]: to Clone duplicate mother of that seed
mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: No Unproven healthy genetics, you know one
or two generations or even a handful of
[SPEAKER_01]: generations down if you keep that plant a
healthy state You know free from pests and
[SPEAKER_01]: disease and just gives it all that give it
all the inputs that it needs You have a
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy plant, you know, I've seen very
few cases of that genetic drift,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know You know in that sense and the
plants are getting older and like all the
[SPEAKER_01]: old mom stock genetic drift, you know,
it's like well and A plant that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: is gonna live for a very long time
Shouldn't get the same recipe as a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that's gonna live for a short amount of
time You have to you have to look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole picture, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's usually the plant you could keep a
healthy plant going for six months nine
[SPEAKER_01]: months Like you can you just have to do a
lot of things to make sure it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy and free for yet these for that
period of time You know, that's awesome
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we used to do that for Our outdoor
season we started running these big old
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses outside and I was like man
This is not indoor growing anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've got to kind of change our
headspace up We need more veg if we're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna wind up with these gigantic ass
plants, you know, yeah So we would fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: there was a couple cultivars that were
really really slow growing and to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: nice proper bush and the Other thing is
going from an indoor environment when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're growing over the winter You know
and getting a nice healthy one before that
[SPEAKER_02]: spring and bringing it out there You
already got something big that acclimates
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot faster than you know Like a little
tiny clone would that right was already
[SPEAKER_02]: used to an indoor environment So we'd bush
these things out for like six months
[SPEAKER_02]: Indoor, you know We just get these huge
ones that were about to touch the light
[SPEAKER_02]: and then just move them outdoor and wind
up with like 14 foot plants of some Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it is a pain the ass and then you got all
that defoliation that trimming and just
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to keep that shape Oh, but see
there was one in specific that's coming to
[SPEAKER_02]: mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a femme of And I don't grow very
many femmes But we did have one that we
[SPEAKER_02]: liked and it was called blueberry
cheesecake and it was such a finicky
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic If you grew it outdoor in all
natural Sun, it's completely fine Would
[SPEAKER_02]: give you amazing yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would grow like a tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be really really tall You grew that
same thing indoor under synthetic or
[SPEAKER_02]: unnatural lighting and it would throw a
nanner or two every single time Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, it was like we were keeping it over
winter just to grow it outdoor I mean is
[SPEAKER_01]: different in that sense and like where it
grows and how it grows and the inputs that
[SPEAKER_01]: it receives and what it likes and what it
can thrive in or is really unique to each
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic, you know, like They're bred in
certain ways bred from certain lineage,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like there's there's real to
that, you know these environments guys,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of you have to grow,
you know your veg with your clones or Mix
[SPEAKER_02]: it up like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you can spare the time To make your
own clone room.
[SPEAKER_02]: They definitely have their own conditions
that they grow in And to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: control that environment a little bit more
what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Light schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you prefer to use for your clones?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know a lot of these guys are
using are doing the same thing Like I said
[SPEAKER_02]: growing veg and their clones in the same
room So they're probably running 18 6
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe 24 What what light schedule do you
like to use?
[SPEAKER_01]: For four clones, I like 24 hours man for
clones like 24 hours I like consistency
[SPEAKER_01]: that I could kind of predict You know that
that stable environment in my in my you
[SPEAKER_01]: know little micro environment With the
clones, you know And if I have 18 6 going
[SPEAKER_01]: on nearby I'm not worried about That
little bit of light interruption,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, because you're you're still in a
vegetative state You know, the plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: still asleep right a little bit of you
know, lighting is not gonna You know make
[SPEAKER_01]: it stop veg, you know, make it veg more
like what's gonna happen I said the veg
[SPEAKER_01]: more like So I'm not scared of a little
bit of you know over lighting,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like a little overlap,
you know Indirect yeah direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's a different story.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just light You know,
but uh, yeah with the clones 24 hours,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know keeps things nice and stable And
you said you were using kelp as well How
[SPEAKER_02]: do you like to use kelp you use as a root
drench or do you use it a foliar both?
[SPEAKER_01]: Both both both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah How do you schedule your your
kelp weed to the time that you take clone?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So They get kelp on day one of clone as
well, so I kind of just Reverse,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know go back from there, you know and
and have my weekly root drench You know
[SPEAKER_01]: planned out of you know about a week
before that You know kind of based on when
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna clone because it's gonna get
another treatment then right so Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's I kind of just take it back,
you know about a week before and Give me
[SPEAKER_01]: some kelp in the roots kelp in the foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like a little sooner Like the day
before or you know within a you know day
[SPEAKER_01]: or two before Cloning I like to do a
little root foliar spray with the kelp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah getting those natural plant
regulators in there To get those roots
[SPEAKER_02]: shooting out before you get them taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome, man Have you cut is there
any?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any types that you've come across that
you're just like you walk into a room.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, alright clone coach We're
doing this today and you're like fuck
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you haven't worked in the license
industry Well, look man, it's there The
[SPEAKER_01]: license regulated industry the companies
that are popping up just cultivation sites
[SPEAKER_01]: in my experience at least You know,
I can only speak on you know what I've
[SPEAKER_01]: experienced, you know from 2018 of working
at different spots there There's startups
[SPEAKER_01]: that are like kind of micro corporate,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like corporate startups,
but Funding from you know all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: place because they're just startups right
and startup operators and stuff and then
[SPEAKER_01]: the state and all the extra regulation and
just all this stuff like it's Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, if you're asking if ever have I ever
walked into a room is a fuck after hearing
[SPEAKER_01]: some news Yeah, man, it's happened once or
twice Walking into a cold you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so you've come across that are like harder
to clone than anything else There's some
[SPEAKER_01]: harder ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just some uglier ones,
you know It's just things that just don't
[SPEAKER_01]: veg nice but you know and don't give off a
lot of clones in a mother plant or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like that, but they You know had
a popular flower, you know, so But yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's some stuff that this doesn't veg
very well What's been some of your
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite genetics to work with?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I start off with the first genetic
that I worked with You know, which was
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonder Woman from Nirvana seeds That I
ordered in high school hadn't stored in a
[SPEAKER_01]: drawer and had a brother a friend of mine
Need them provided the seeds and then when
[SPEAKER_01]: I was when I quit my job to start cloning
Those are the first clones I ever took was
[SPEAKER_01]: from those that genetic that they said
going you had a little bathroom of it went
[SPEAKER_01]: into the bathroom got a couple mother
plants took my first like 30 40 clones of
[SPEAKER_01]: this Wonder Woman strain and Started my
nursery there man, like that was full
[SPEAKER_01]: circle with those, you know seeds that I
bought online You know as a kid,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know in my teens What lights were you
using back then?
[SPEAKER_01]: middle highlights middle highlights were
like that I kind of just stuck with early
[SPEAKER_01]: on in the early days and Now you prefer
the CMH showing I do I do yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the plants do so You know,
I listen to them Do you have some do I
[SPEAKER_01]: hear some resentment to the LEDs I Hate
having to adjust everything to accommodate
[SPEAKER_01]: for these LEDs That's just me And still
and still You know not get I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's still there's still not a
resentment man You know, there's I've
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely read some solid mom stock and
veg stock underneath LEDs, but it You're
[SPEAKER_01]: playing a different game and you you
really are adjusting everything else and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're usually higher inputs not lower
inputs You know for this lower light LED
[SPEAKER_01]: lower wattage, but then you know Yeah,
but they're on the efficacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They require a little bit more Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I mean for me to get the
same result in my plant You have to give
[SPEAKER_01]: it a bunch more right if I under CMH I
could have very healthy very solid green
[SPEAKER_01]: solid green and from from top to bottom
solid green plants Healthy like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know the low twos in the EC right low
low to mid twos in the EC with healthy bio
[SPEAKER_01]: stimulants and light and stuff like that
But with LED like I would get purple
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where I get purple stems purple
striping so I have to adjust base adjust
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake adjust, you know that started
adjusting and for veg specifically I Don't
[SPEAKER_01]: you know That the wattage is not that big
of a difference like I don't need a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: wattage and veg anyways So for flower,
maybe it's a different story, you know But
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's not that's not my round.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but for veg man, you don't need
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean you Less than a thousand watts over
four by you know over 32 square foot,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know for baits You know Trey,
you know, you get a thousand watts on that
[SPEAKER_01]: you get get a thousand clones a month man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't no problem Good point Good
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I switched over to all those LEDs But
honestly, I still prefer and I wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: ask you about this as well to see if it
lines up if you're in a Situation where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing clones on racks and you need
that low profile lighting, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you still go?
[SPEAKER_02]: LED strips or would you go with the t5 out
high outputs or something else?
[SPEAKER_01]: For that for that vertical racking,
you know You can't go see image because I
[SPEAKER_01]: tried that and right like 16 inches,
you know with an LED light You could
[SPEAKER_01]: probably be at 4 inches T5 I never really
liked I never really liked using t5s and
[SPEAKER_01]: ever needed to because I was using the
other lights and stuff So I just don't
[SPEAKER_01]: like him because I've just never never
used them enough to really like them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know But yeah, man, I'd go LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm playing with them too I got
you know some LEDs in the closet right now
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's oh sure You're still doing home
grow as well You know it comes and goes
[SPEAKER_01]: You know whenever whenever I'm able to but
yeah, you know, I'm a patient first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but I am kind of re Regrouping that
room to make it more value based for like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know Trials and research and stuff for
you know the channel for clone coach and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff So I'm you know gonna give it a
little bit more effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's on pause for now you know,
but Yeah, man, I've you know a spare
[SPEAKER_02]: bedroom changed my life, you know,
