Let's get started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, everybody, and welcome to
another episode of the Calyx and Crew
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm your host, as always, Doc Calyx.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today I am joined by two very lovely
women.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canna Queenie here.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing, Canna Queenie?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good, Doc.
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for asking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have Canna Queenie inspired.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came here to talk to you guys today a
little bit about what you guys do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canna Queenie, you are an absolute
powerhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been helping mentor you, and I can't
wait to see you fucking explode with life
[SPEAKER_02]: because you've got so much going on for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canna Care, you are already an independent
boss by the time I met you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm very excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know a little bit more about
what you guys do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Canna Care makes edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I should run and grab on those
during the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I should be doing,
because I promised her I would.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have that lemon cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to know what, Queenie,
what is the Canna Boss Beauties?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me more about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so Canna Boss Beauties are women who
are no longer in the green closet.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're not hiding that they medicate.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are not hiding that they use the
plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're mothers.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not mothers.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're their sisters, their best friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just women that want to come
together, unite, smoke, medicate,
[SPEAKER_08]: heal, treat themselves, and be able to do
it in a safe, positive space without
[SPEAKER_08]: judgment, and make money, and turn that
love of the plant into some type of small
[SPEAKER_08]: business, because a lot of the Canna Boss
Beauties are disabled.
[SPEAKER_08]: They suffer with chronic illness.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they need to make their own stream of
income.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can be a Canna Boss Beauty.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can be a Canna Boss Beauty.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, because it's not limited to
women dying.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not know that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was strictly women.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: We accept everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: As a matter of fact, a part of the
platform, in reality, is a big spotlight
[SPEAKER_08]: on mental health for men.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a lot of men who come onto the
lives, and they talk about their own
[SPEAKER_08]: trauma, their own relationships.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think in listening to all of us,
they're learning so much about themselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think a Canna Boss Beauty can be a
male or female, because I think men are
[SPEAKER_08]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think beauty is limited.
[SPEAKER_08]: To just a woman.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm down.
[SPEAKER_08]: I accept everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm inclusive, not exclusive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, everybody seems to kind of
have their niche, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was wondering if that was part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you guys definitely empower a lot
of women, especially women that have small
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses, to, you know, blow up and kind
of expose them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You all help each other out, kind of like
we do over in the Discord.
[SPEAKER_02]: You all group together and you're out to
help each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not there for competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're there for one purpose, and that's
helping each other out constantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk to you about your edibles
here for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's bring you up really quick on the big
screen.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how long have you been making edibles?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like maybe a year now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you serious?
[SPEAKER_02]: Only a year?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the first edible you made?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just cookies, regular chocolate chip
cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did we go from cookies to cake
pops, nerd ropes?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like baking and I cook a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just constantly am making new things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was always, it infused everything
with DHC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, once I started using it for that,
it was like constantly infused everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can we fit this in?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge congrats.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to grab your edibles here in a
little bit and show everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only are they awesome, but they're
extremely potent, way too potent for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been growing since oh four and I've
made the classic brownies and cookies and
[SPEAKER_02]: all that shit, but never in my life have
I, I think the most intense thing I've
[SPEAKER_02]: ever seen is like a silo Simon infused
truffle, like a chocolate truffle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the, the shit that you do with campus
is pretty damn cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 200 milligrams or a cake pop,
that'll knock out a horse.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will not.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I need two of her cake pops.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a horrible metabolism.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a horrible metabolism.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I need two.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I am a frequent shopper of candy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did try the cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cookies were very, very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I have yet to have a cake pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I'm going to take at least
I'll take half of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take half of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not as cool as you, Mel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't take that many edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is and dab anybody on
to the table or smoke them out all fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: day, but I ain't about to get into an
edibles race.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when did the cannabis beauties thing
start?
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I started canna Queenie combos back
in, I think it was, um, March of this,
[SPEAKER_08]: of 2022.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the girls started just coming on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we couldn't figure out a name because
at the beginning I was like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_08]: can a mom boss for cannabis boss or
whatever, but I can't be like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause not all the girls are moms.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm like, okay, what are we going to
do?
[SPEAKER_08]: And baby, Oh, Olga, I was on a live one
day at an event.
[SPEAKER_08]: And she's like, you know what,
Mel, cannabis beauties.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that was like June of this
year.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we put cannabis beauties together with
the Cali trip and it just kind of stuck.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what we are.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I keep saying it's men and
women, because when you, I get the thought
[SPEAKER_08]: like cannabis beauty, you think women,
but again, we've got to start including
[SPEAKER_08]: men in, in the business.
[SPEAKER_08]: I empower women, but at the same time,
if I shut off my mind to not dealing with
[SPEAKER_08]: men in some sort of, in some sort of
capacity, then you and I wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_08]: having this exchange right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I had to find a balance.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where I could still, I could still include
men, but make the women feel like they had
[SPEAKER_08]: their voice.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm still trying to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think I'm, I think we're on the
right track because most of the men that
[SPEAKER_08]: come to our lives are super respectful.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've been in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: They kind of know what we're about.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we've already showed people
that if, you know, if any of the men come
[SPEAKER_08]: to our lives and they're disrespectful,
or, you know, they can't treat us the
[SPEAKER_08]: right way.
[SPEAKER_08]: We kind of unite as a group and we stick
up for one another and we'll go to bat for
[SPEAKER_08]: one another to make sure we're respected.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys had your Cali meetup pretty
recently and everybody sounds like they
[SPEAKER_02]: had a very amazing time at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's a Vegas situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't explain everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need every detail here,
but what was some of the highlights of the
[SPEAKER_02]: trip?
[SPEAKER_07]: My shrooms trip.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I like to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely a psilocybin advocate,
just as much as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tell everybody I use cannabis for the
physical.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use psilocybin for the mental.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a definite highlight of the trip.
[SPEAKER_08]: Me and Awal had a very deep conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I remember physically having a
conversation with Awal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And expressing my emotions.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the first time as a woman that I
was like, I am actually speaking to Awal,
[SPEAKER_08]: but change is happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This wall is listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: This wall fucking understands right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't even smoked today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we need to change that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Canikure got me through that shroom trip.
[SPEAKER_08]: Canikure really got me through that shroom
trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: She really did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God you got somebody like Canikure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll do it again with her any day.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll trip on shrooms with her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that your first time doing shrooms?
[SPEAKER_08]: It was.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was, you know, okay, so the back of
the box said...
[SPEAKER_08]: Three to five pieces, happy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Six to 10 pieces.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to feel like you have energy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it said 10 and up.
[SPEAKER_08]: The walls are going to melt.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I ate 12 because I wasn't raised to
be a quitter.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I went balls to the wall and the walls
melted.
[SPEAKER_08]: The walls truly did melt.
[SPEAKER_08]: Spider-Man was moving.
[SPEAKER_08]: Spider-Man was dancing on that painting.
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear to God.
[SPEAKER_02]: You lost me at shrooms in a box.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so it's chocolate.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was chocolate shrooms.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so this was like a homegirl or that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, where the hell are you getting
mushrooms in a box?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I need to go down to California.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go Costco on that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you smoking on over there,
Queenie?
[SPEAKER_08]: From my personal pharmacist in the West
Coast, OG Runts.
[SPEAKER_02]: OG Runts, right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about you, Candy Care?
[SPEAKER_03]: I am smoking the white Runts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's Runtsing up their life,
huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn, I'm the only one different over
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have to change that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to expose you guys to a little bit
more of the Runts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I will say I enjoy you know,
West Coast gas.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're in the West Coast, right,
Doc?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, I'm up in Washington.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that the farthest you've ever
traveled?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see you all pulling out shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can shut up for a sec.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can hit something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not smoke today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hit it, Doc.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say while you're warming up your
banger there, that Candy Care played an
[SPEAKER_08]: essential role in some of the changes that
I made.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of it had to do with the fact that
her and I, we connect on a level of being
[SPEAKER_08]: women with ADHD.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that this trip was the first time
that I was in a position where I was
[SPEAKER_08]: constantly being overstimulated.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't sleeping.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, strain after strain after strain
after strain.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was kind of like up and down.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I remember at one point, Candy Care
had a, we had like a deep talk.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of it had to do with the fact
that I finally found someone at 44 who
[SPEAKER_08]: could understand my ADHD and not make me
feel bad about myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: So out of the whole trip, I probably took
the conversation that her and I had
[SPEAKER_08]: together in her car.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was probably one of my favorite
moments out of the whole trip.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause it was like, I finally felt
understood and accepted for exactly who I
[SPEAKER_08]: am at such an older age too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to hit the mute button while you're
coughing.
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you said in the discord, Doc,
we die with each other here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't mute when we dab and discord,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: We just die together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gives me less to edit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The discord is like, so I've been doing
this on IG and like 14 or 15, somewhere in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And back then it was me and my ex and we'd
just sit on a couch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd have my phone right in front of us
and we'd just smoke weed and talk to
[SPEAKER_02]: whoever ever popped in.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't a point.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just getting high with random
people and it eventually turned into like
[SPEAKER_02]: people that I knew coming into lives with
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just talk about shit that we had
learned about cannabis and people started
[SPEAKER_02]: watching in realizing, you know,
who I was, what groups I ran with and shit
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just kind of naturally evolved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it got to a point where I never felt,
I never had enough confidence in myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: To think that I could be a business owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I I grew up in, you know, orchards and
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a farmer my entire fucking life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for anybody that's in that lifestyle,
it's kind of like this is the rest of your
[SPEAKER_02]: life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Farms get handed down generation to
generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you're going to do,
you know, and that you're not ever going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be much more than a farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something happened along the way where
I got seeds and I fell in love with the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and I disconnected with it for a few
years and then got a bag seed and a bud of
[SPEAKER_02]: like go strain haze and said, you know
what, I'm going to try to pop this one
[SPEAKER_02]: open.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I sure as enough cracked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was kind of like the old days,
just water it, let it grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't really understand too much
about the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at that point, I really wanted to
understand how some of these people on IG
[SPEAKER_02]: were like getting these, you know,
great yields and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it took my interest to learn as much as
I could.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just I can't even put into words the
amount of passion that I have in myself
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beyond anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything led down another wormhole
from going to learn how to get better
[SPEAKER_02]: yields and training my plants and the
soil, what's going into the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: the science behind the soil, what I can do
to make it better, the environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything I could learn about cannabis I
did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm still learning every single day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess at the end of the day,
I looked at it and I said, hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is still agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was time to up my game.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do something with my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a huge change to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And having that much confidence when I see
that and other people that have that
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking passion and that fire like you,
Mel, when I saw you, you had so much fire
[SPEAKER_02]: and passion in you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just knew you needed that little boost
of confidence and a little guidance to get
[SPEAKER_02]: you to where you want to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a really good friend help me out
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's nice having make friends with
people that are going to make you a better
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're surrounding yourself with shit,
you're going to have shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you surround yourself with fucking
leaders and positivity, that's what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to have in your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Surround yourself with the kind of people
that you relate to, that you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: become like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, take inspiration from those
people and don't let people, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: put you out at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're emotional creatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's always going to be somebody
that doesn't like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, fuck them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 10 people that do like you for
everyone that hates you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they hate you so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is my mantra to be friends with
someone that's not afraid to say your name
[SPEAKER_08]: in a room full of opportunity.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that's the type of people I want to
roll with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I go somewhere, maybe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I do make candles on the side and you
know, I don't even talk about it because
[SPEAKER_08]: it's not where my heart is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I forget that I even do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if I go somewhere and they're like,
well, I don't like candles, but I like
[SPEAKER_08]: edibles.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I got somebody who knows edibles.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I like somebody who does resin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, then we'll throw them to Santulli.
[SPEAKER_08]: Santulli does resin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I need someone that does shirts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, so we move like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sarah and I went to Thicket, the Thicket
Now headquarters out in Chino.
[SPEAKER_08]: And before we left, we would look at each
other and Sarah was like, I'm not leaving
[SPEAKER_08]: without something for the girls.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, I ain't either.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are we going to ask for?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, are we going to ask for nine
tickets?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, are we going to?
[SPEAKER_08]: And Sarah was like, yeah, let's ask for
fucking nine tickets.
[SPEAKER_08]: We walked out of there with
ambassadorships for each and every girl
[SPEAKER_08]: with their own code.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like,
[SPEAKER_08]: we gave them an opportunity to now become
ambassadors so they could go to other
countries.
[SPEAKER_08]: Companies and they can say, no,
I've done this before.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've already had my own code, you know,
and they feel empowered.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is what a cannabis beauty is.
[SPEAKER_08]: My sister's success is my success.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are not in competition.
[SPEAKER_08]: The cannabis community has to stop being
in competition.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's room for everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a common ground.
[SPEAKER_08]: So why are we trying to be in competition
with one another when we can help one
[SPEAKER_08]: another?
[SPEAKER_08]: There's always someone for something for.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'm still trying to find myself in
Canna Queenie, but that's where it keeps
[SPEAKER_08]: leading me down that road.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's helping other women get to where
they got to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe coming up with an idea for
another woman that she didn't think of or.
[SPEAKER_08]: But Canna Cure for me is more than just
edibles.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Canna Cure also does RSO and she does
like, you know, RSO greens and she does
[SPEAKER_08]: CBD and she just she heals my face.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so when I think of Canna Cure,
edibles comes to mind, but more her RSO
[SPEAKER_08]: and her dragon juice and her infused
lemonade and the way people can medicate
[SPEAKER_08]: without smoking using her product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm glad you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was a more recent venture.
[SPEAKER_02]: You getting into the RSO.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did that end up coming out?
[SPEAKER_03]: I started making RSO around the time my
dad died.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I made it before he died kind of for
somebody, a patient who would actually buy
[SPEAKER_03]: all of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I never got to use any of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when the patient ended up dying,
he was a cancer patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was you know, then I started making
it for myself or for my dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it was kind of too late on that
end also as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I kind of get to keep it for
myself and my patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's for you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't really treat myself before with
any of my medications besides with herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a big change when I did start
doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the inflammation has definitely
changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this difference a lot that I'm
losing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I use the RSO, I don't have
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very obvious.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoking and medicating with RSO is
completely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like smoking has almost no benefit
but for mental benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely not as powerful for pain
relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you smoke it, you're hitting
a lot of CB1 receptors when you eat it or
[SPEAKER_02]: digest it like you do with RSO and
edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're hitting CB2 receptors and those are
a lot better.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're better at treating that pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on a daily basis, what would you say
milligram wise was like your treatment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you like, I'm okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have very little pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably take like four drinks a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: In your most recent edible, you did the
lemonade, the sweet tea and there's one
[SPEAKER_02]: other.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were those?
[SPEAKER_03]: The pink lemonade?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they were 300 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: 300 milligram drinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard very good things about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That from everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely want to get into that sweet
tea.
[SPEAKER_08]: What was your favorite Mel?
[SPEAKER_08]: The pink lemonade.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pink lemonade?
[SPEAKER_08]: Hands down, the pink lemonade is my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about you KaniKia?
[SPEAKER_03]: The pink lemonade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that the consensus that you got and
reviewed all those?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was like everybody saying pink lemonade or
was there something that was a little more
[SPEAKER_02]: popular?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure it was the pink lemonade.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you need a third judge and I think
I need to be that person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll send you one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I saw that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that sweet tea and was like,
I'm all about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the newest adventure for your
podcast there Mel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's shout that one out real quick.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I'm going to start.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've committed to start dropping my
episodes every Wednesdays at 420 PM
[SPEAKER_08]: Eastern Standard Time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think I'm going to start focusing on
endometriosis, fibromyalgia.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think I'm going to start doing like
a dab review because I'm really liking the
[SPEAKER_08]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that that's the next venture.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm not going to do one-on-ones on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm going to keep one-on-ones on
my lives.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I think on the podcast,
that's just going to be me speaking,
[SPEAKER_08]: no camera.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm going to do outlines and I'm going
to stick to a whole kind of script.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's going to change.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be different from my first
four or five episodes moving forward.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to call it season two.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to call it season two.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's just going to be more me doing
my own cannabis education, my own mental
[SPEAKER_08]: health awareness, my own chronic illness
awareness journey, and do like strain of
[SPEAKER_08]: the day, like strain reviews.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's where I'm going to
start.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're both awesome women and you're doing
awesome things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want more people to find out about
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you guys to be more successful and
more happy with your lives, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Doc.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go grab that edible from
CannaCare really quick.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the States.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I've been to Dominican Republic,
Puerto Rico, you know, but I've never
[SPEAKER_08]: been, you know, cause I studied and I
lived in Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_08]: My husband's from Dominican Republic.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but this was the first time I went
from like East coast to West coast,
[SPEAKER_08]: like across the country per se.
[SPEAKER_08]: I loved the Cali climate.
[SPEAKER_08]: I loved the tacos.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had tacos every single day.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the tacos.
[SPEAKER_08]: Del Taco.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Del Taco.
[SPEAKER_08]: I enjoyed waking up every day and session
with my Canna sisters.
[SPEAKER_08]: I enjoyed being in an environment for the
first time as a woman where I was
[SPEAKER_08]: encouraged to eat, where I was encouraged
to snack, where I could walk around with
[SPEAKER_08]: just a t-shirt and underwear and everyone
would scream, Mal, get your pants on.
[SPEAKER_08]: But no one judged me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, I was able to heal from
trauma.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was able to be away from my husband for
the first time since I was 17 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: And be on an independent trip without my
partner in crime.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I had to grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to depend on myself for every single
moment.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for someone who's been in a
relationship more, more than she was alive
[SPEAKER_08]: without one, that was an incredible
journey for me to go on and to feel those
[SPEAKER_08]: feelings without being able to turn to my
husband and have him encourage me.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I learned a lot of self-validation and
a lot of self-correction on this trip.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And let me tell you, Ventura beach was
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pismo beach was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: We went to Ventura beach at night.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a bonfire, me, Kandika.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were waiting for Rasta.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I healed that night on the
beach.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a lot of trauma with the beach.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I held my sister's hands
and we went into the water at night.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I got all of that on,
you know, there were moments that maybe
[SPEAKER_08]: the girls didn't even realize were just
monumental for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they were the small things that no one
would think mattered, but they mattered
[SPEAKER_08]: incredibly to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like my drive with Kandika manicure,
seeing where she grew up, seeing the
[SPEAKER_08]: school she went to, you know, meeting her
grandmother, meeting her brother,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, it was a privilege and it didn't
escape me what a privilege it was to be
[SPEAKER_08]: accepted into her home, into Olga's home,
into Stoney the Latina's home.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I'm blessed to know these women.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I didn't grow up with this type
of community.
[SPEAKER_08]: So to find it at an age where I was
already starting to feel lost was life
[SPEAKER_08]: saving.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Cannibals and Canaquinis saved me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And cannabis saved me.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, cannabis saved my life.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I've encountered in Instagram,
good, bad, or indifferent, has saved my
[SPEAKER_08]: life.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has changed me for the better.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's my reflection.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what year did you start smoking?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your first experience?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, I'm from the South Bronx.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I grew up around weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I always believe that weed and
hip hop is the Bronx in New York.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, you can't talk about the
South Bronx and not mention weed and hip
[SPEAKER_08]: hop.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was probably like, I want to say 15
the first time, like I used to have a
[SPEAKER_08]: blunt with like a bacon, egg, and cheese
for breakfast, you know, but it wasn't
[SPEAKER_08]: anything but to be out smoking with people
and cutting class.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, in 2015, I was, was when my
endometriosis started to flare and I
[SPEAKER_08]: became, I had three months left to my
master's and one month left for my own
[SPEAKER_08]: department after working for 23 years to
get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And bladder endometriosis took all that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And none of the pain medication I was on
helped.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amitriptyline, gabapentin, Lupron.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did chemo for it, everything,
nothing worked.
[SPEAKER_08]: And finally, my friend's husband,
who was one of my patients at the
[SPEAKER_08]: hospital, he brought me a blunt.
[SPEAKER_08]: He drove from Greenwich, Connecticut to
New York City, which is like almost an
[SPEAKER_08]: hour.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he brought me a blunt and he was like,
yo, sis, hit this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, no, I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if I go back to work,
they'll drug test me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was like, no, hit this,
hit this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I remember just taking a pull.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then by the third pull, my bladder
just relaxed and pain that I have been
[SPEAKER_08]: fighting for three years, like it relaxed
and I never turned back.
[SPEAKER_08]: But now I do more than just smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: I dab, I take RSO, I take CBD.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I treat it, I do it more than
just recreational.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I feel like it's 360.
[SPEAKER_08]: I treat myself in different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that you went through chemo
for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lupron is one of the first medications
they give women with endometriosis because
[SPEAKER_08]: what it does is it causes medical
menopause.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the thought behind endometriosis is a
dominance in estrogen.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know you're a dad to three girls,
so it's quite an opportunity to be able to
[SPEAKER_08]: educate you while they're still small
because one in three women have
[SPEAKER_08]: endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you have three daughters,
the chances that one of them may have
[SPEAKER_08]: endometriosis is more than 76%.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so girls as young as nine begin with
signs of endometriosis and we don't get
[SPEAKER_08]: much research.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no treatment plan.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what they do is they say, well,
let me give you the Lupron because if you
[SPEAKER_08]: don't have a period in a year and then
your pain goes away, well, we'll do a
[SPEAKER_08]: hysterectomy because that's the only way
we can take a woman's estrogen,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is the problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm on the Lupron.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's tons of fucking side effects from
the Lupron and I'm talking hair loss,
[SPEAKER_08]: bone loss, bone density loss, um,
hot flashes, uh, chronic pain,
[SPEAKER_08]: fibromyalgia, depression, suicide,
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are all the side effects and I'm
still in pain and I'm not menstruating and
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still developing new endometriomas and
nobody can help.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so endometriosis is what brought me to
cannabis and I'm making it one of the main
[SPEAKER_08]: parts of my platform because I keep
meeting people like you, Doc, who have a
[SPEAKER_08]: daughter, you know, have three daughters
or, you know, a husband who's like,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, my wife is always in pain and I
don't know why.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's become almost a part of the vision
and the mission to make clear that
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis is the only proper treatment
other than surgery to help with
[SPEAKER_08]: endometriosis pain.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is the only medication that can help
manage stage four endometriosis pain
[SPEAKER_08]: period.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no one can convince me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you mix the flour with the RSO,
there's even studies that show that RSO
[SPEAKER_08]: can help generate new tissue.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is what women need new regenerative
endometrium lining tissue.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's, there's research that RSO can
help with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if I can bring that and I can just
help one woman, then my job is done.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how I'm going to bring 25 years of
clinical experience and my journey with
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis and endo to the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And see, this is that passion I was
talking about as you got into that and you
[SPEAKER_02]: told the story and you got deeper and
deeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could feel it bring you back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something close to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That chemo would not work for you,
but three hits of cannabis and you almost
[SPEAKER_02]: get instant relief saying something about
the plant facts.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you recently, both of you recently
joined my discord.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canna Queenie, you're a member over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I hear you came in recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think of it so far?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I look forward to certain people dabbing
with me when every day when I dab,
[SPEAKER_08]: we all know who that person is.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like my personal cheerleader.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's painting.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just makes me feel like I did a five
gram dab and it's like a tiny and he's
[SPEAKER_08]: like, yeah, Queenie.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's the tiniest little dad,
but I love the vibe and I love the
[SPEAKER_08]: environment that you created at your
discord.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just period.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a fact.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's a hard thing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will tell you, one of the greatest
tips that I can give you is don't be
[SPEAKER_02]: afraid to fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing that you ever do for the first
time like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to start off awesome or
there's nothing to learn?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reason to grow at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to fuck up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had some big fuck ups during this
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all those fuck ups are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you sit there and you focus on them,
you're going to drive yourself insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, like you got to
realize you're going to fuck up and you
[SPEAKER_02]: just got to deal with it and move on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would not have made a decision if you
did not think it was right at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just make your decision and move on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But stick true to your values because,
you know, not every person that you bring
[SPEAKER_02]: into your group are you going to be like,
yep, you're right for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the point of finding those people
that you do vibe with is you just got to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, stick to your morals,
set your boundaries and the rest will do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll work itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: Facts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we over at Canna Queenie, we're always
saying that our journey is like an
[SPEAKER_08]: elevator and not everybody makes it to the
top.
[SPEAKER_08]: So on every floor, people get on and off
when you're in the elevator.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thus far we've had people get on and
off, on and off.
[SPEAKER_08]: And right now me, Canna Cure and,
you know, a selective few that we're still
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of binding together and making it
work.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like we're the ones that are just
going to make it to the top together.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm ready to make it to the top of
Canna Cure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Going up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not want to sit for 10 minutes off
the stream rummaging through my fridge
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to find that lemon one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I promise you I'll eat that one within
the next couple of days.
[SPEAKER_02]: But instead, what I brought you guys is
this amazing arch enemy of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: The baby muffins.
[SPEAKER_08]: The muffins.
[SPEAKER_08]: See the muffins are good though.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's laughing her ass off because I ate
like one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I felt, I said, don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think she told me 150 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since there was three in there,
I assumed that they were, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 milligrams apiece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're 50 milligrams apiece.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why she's laughing at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I tell her, I said, don't worry about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I do over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I make some cookies and I make
some brownies, but I'm not, I'm an awesome
[SPEAKER_02]: cook and I make some really, really cool
cannabis infused dinners, but I don't fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: around with edibles too much as far as
like treats and snacks and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do like an infused salad or infused
pasta infused barbecue sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: We make infused salsa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it's just like keeping cannabis
covered and it's making regular recipes
[SPEAKER_02]: with infused ingredients, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's not too much different to
me, but I'm not that creative where I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to go out of my way to make a nerd's
roof and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cake pops, cake pops kind of,
okay, there's two treats on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the high section of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two treats that piss me off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sugar cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of hate sugar cookies and I hate
cake pops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not, not the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can it care?
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot wait to have it, but I'll tell
you why.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when I think of cake pops,
I instantly think of, uh, and they have
[SPEAKER_02]: those fucking cake pops on a stick and
they won't, what, like five, six bucks for
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like one bite of cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just buy me a cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: A piece of cake bite.
[SPEAKER_02]: No,
[SPEAKER_02]: I will not pay that much for one bite of
fucking cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's infused, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that one's going to fuck me up,
you know, for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's where I got the lime
coconut bar idea that I make for what the
[SPEAKER_03]: one edible that I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually got it from Starbucks because I
went there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go to Starbucks every day before work
and I never eat any desserts, obviously,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I did see that on the menu one day and
I ordered it because obviously that's an
[SPEAKER_03]: awesome idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I got the ingredients and I made
it that day on my way home from work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the best, the best thing on my
menu now.
[SPEAKER_02]: On that one, so Starbucks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which muffins are those?
[SPEAKER_08]: Which muffins do you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the banana net.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are so good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're so good.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to try the bacon maple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I saw that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like bacon maple.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's like, well, like,
is that a cream cheese or like a vanilla
[SPEAKER_08]: frosting inside?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a maple cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a maple cream.
[SPEAKER_08]: That coffee sets it off, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: The coffee sets it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're giving me the munchies.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got the munchies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's just high as shit thinking
about food now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Screw you both.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just did a 12 hour shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came in to do a podcast with y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still not have not eight, not have
eight.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have not eight yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I not have eight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not have eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not have eight nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's teach poor grammar while we're on
here because we're high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to I'm going to bite into one
of these muffins really quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: What other flavors did you make,
Kanakir?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking lion and coconut.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like I would be all over that
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely the lion coconut bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite kind of thing to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a bacon maple.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every time you say it, I taste it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every time you say it, I can taste it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're not green at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can smell the weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they want to be green.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, look at the way he's smelling though.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like when people start with like a
really like, do you do you ever do butter
[SPEAKER_02]: infuse much butter?
[SPEAKER_03]: For me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I make butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I make everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to make butter all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: So right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you make butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you make butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not a trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to think there's people watching
the stream that have never made an edible
[SPEAKER_02]: in their life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't know what to infuse.
I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize you're talking to me,
but you can completely relax.
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck, dog?
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't fucking know muffins are made
with fucking butter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, butter is literally on her
menu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calm down, Kanakir.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're about to get into the section where
we have to speak Spanish.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't taste any weed at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes like damn good banana nut bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you sprinkle sugar on the top?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, do you like?
[SPEAKER_02]: I love your nuts in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what she said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, that that one's getting left in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's getting left.
[SPEAKER_02]: No shame.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm completely confident in my sexuality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Working a factory is my job around men for
12 literally half my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think I'm scared of a nut in my
mouth joke, I'm not at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm enjoying this right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Loving my nuts in your mouth, knowing that
they were in my hand and they're in your
[SPEAKER_03]: mouth at this very moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you could go as far as to say
there were other people involved between
[SPEAKER_02]: them being in your hands and going into my
mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just one.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even have to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I'm trying to think about how many
people have touched Kanakir's nuts before.
[SPEAKER_08]: How many people touched the nuts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, your nuts have been all around the
world at this point, just dropping in
[SPEAKER_02]: mouths, making people happy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had I too have had Kanakir nuts in my
mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got some really sweet, fruity nuts and
that's saying a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them have an off taste.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone loves a moist, nutty muffin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone loves a moist and nutty muffin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, y'all like my net.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who doesn't like a moist muffin?
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate that word.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most people do, doc.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most people do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just sound so vulgar.
[SPEAKER_07]: Moist sounds vulgar, but not your nuts in
my mouth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your nuts in my mouth isn't vulgar.
[SPEAKER_07]: But moist is.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's comedy relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing comedy about moist to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not laughing if you say moist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I'm saying that driving myself
insane over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you put the muffin part in
there, it just got worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess when it comes to.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, I will change my wording.
[SPEAKER_08]: I too enjoy a non-dry muffin.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love a non-dry muffin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who doesn't?
[SPEAKER_02]: This train is going off the tracks right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoy my own podcast most because I give
no fucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's throw it all in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've done a few interviews.
[SPEAKER_08]: Best one yet is this one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear to God, it's the funniest and most
real.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another good tip for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your number one best quality that you
could have as a podcaster going into you
[SPEAKER_02]: said you weren't going to do the one on
one interviews anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's extremely important for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even if you do group interviews or,
you know, smoke sessions and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that, make sure your your co-hosts are
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, well, the more the more you're over in
discord, the more you'll see it,
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's like doctrine filtered over
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I get that vibe over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I feel free to be me over
there, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the point behind it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, there are no pussies in this
court.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I don't get that vibe.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, there are no that's not that vibe.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you can't.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really I.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, shut up, Mel.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead, Doc.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was about to eat the last bit
of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really, I really feel like the best
thing that you could give me is feedback
[SPEAKER_02]: about what I've created.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like to be in this court,
you can't be a bitch.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't be a bitch because we do a lot
of everything is texting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything is a lot of it is texting.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in this court, it taught me how to not
read a text with emotion because in a lot
[SPEAKER_08]: of the no matter, I don't even know
sometimes if it's a man or a woman because
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what their handle or their
avatar is.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this court has really taught me to not
read something with emotion, to just read
[SPEAKER_08]: the words for what they're saying.
[SPEAKER_08]: What they are, you know, because it could
be, I don't know, it could be any of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're just writing while they're
driving.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I learned how to not be such a bitch
in this court.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no there's like there's no crying
in baseball.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no bitch ass in this in this
court.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just me.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look like I'm going to take a
screenshot of that during that part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast, because you when you said you
can't be a bitch, you literally got that
[SPEAKER_02]: like hard look like you're like.
[SPEAKER_08]: Discord, I agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what I love about your discord.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is just that type of vibe.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no everyone's taking shots.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone's lighthearted.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel like I'm home there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like I'm just amongst a bunch of
cousins.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody's taking shots.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that's me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's there's a lot more to
experience about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you were saying, not reading info or
not reading emotions into what people are
[SPEAKER_02]: writing in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I try to stick to I do so much
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard for me to stick to one single
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking to one person for too long,
messaging everything throughout my day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather send you a, you know,
voice chat or something, because my
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking I can't write to that many people
a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I try to make the focus on it where
there is cannabis information.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can share different things,
talk about things and text fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really, really have been trying to
focus on the video.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we have like the voice
smoke room sessions and stuff where you
[SPEAKER_02]: can turn on your camera, you can turn on
your audio, you can get to know that
[SPEAKER_02]: person.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can connect with different growers all
around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I care?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go to the bottom of the server,
find the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: connections, click on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll show you every state in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Click on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody in that thread is growers from
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Tim.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's an awesome feature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then obviously our live shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are going to be on do or dab coming
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so proud of you, Mel.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm stoked for that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I must secure the dab for said
competition, which I will, because it's
[SPEAKER_08]: the end of November.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know who my opponent is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not run the do or dabs anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I host the do or dabs, but I do not.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Panda that gets all the writers
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Hostile Panda.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Panda.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was Dank Panda and then he became
Hostile Panda.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hostile Panda.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hoping he puts me up against the
amateur like myself, because I'm I'm
[SPEAKER_08]: afraid I'm not going to be at a pro level
yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I need an amateur dabber like myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hoping.
[SPEAKER_08]: If not, there's going to be a lot of
dabbing and a lot less do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to go against another female
or do you want to go against a male?
[SPEAKER_08]: Now go and dab experience either way.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go up against anybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: I ain't a punk.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my girl.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so proud of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just practicing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't be a bitch.
[SPEAKER_07]: No bitch ass, Mr. Dabbit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be a bitch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, that's what we say.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, can't cure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually ask can't cure.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we say.
[SPEAKER_08]: When we were in Cali and we would choke on
the dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be like, don't be a bitch.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't be a bitch.
[SPEAKER_08]: You better swallow that shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: You better not throw up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be a bitch.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yo, we were trying to see like who could
take the big.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like a sorority frat house.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the highest that you've ever been?
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I normally I've never dabbed so
much in my life.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now when I find myself with out dabs,
I can feel the difference with just
[SPEAKER_08]: flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not happy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to be.
[SPEAKER_08]: You see me with my flat iron doc.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to make homemade dabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know what the hell I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wants to be an overnight success.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually talked to another podcaster one
time that had a reel that went super viral
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said, that's the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, well, why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then you have one video.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's getting, you know, a million views
and you're getting no interaction at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because these people like that video.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't like you, you know,
and there's going to be a couple that
[SPEAKER_02]: stopped by.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as the algorithms concerned,
you fell off the face of the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like being a one hit wonder back in
the nineties.
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree that slow is the best place to get
to where you want to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I believe low and slow is the best
way to do damn near anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cook food, grow a server, grow a
following, you know, try to get live rosin
[SPEAKER_08]: out of flour with a flat iron.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so that brings up point number two
about the flat iron and me, because my
[SPEAKER_02]: perception was a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said you were in the elevator.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always pictured one road.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the beginning of your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: End of your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's on that same fucking road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people walk faster than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people walk a little bit slower.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on different paths, but we're all on
the same fucking journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't matter if you're 80 years
old and I'm 20 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might know something that you don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you probably know a lot more than I
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Age is just a number.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we all go down these different paths
of life at a different rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't there's no reason to compete with
anybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think some of the best changes I've
made thus far have been from the women in
[SPEAKER_08]: my group that are not mothers and are
probably 20 years younger than me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I've had tough conversations with
my kids because in my cannabis beauties,
[SPEAKER_08]: I got young mothers like Bella.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I have someone young like Stoney,
who's not a mom.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I get both perspectives.
[SPEAKER_08]: And because we love each other
unconditionally like that, I'm open to all
[SPEAKER_08]: of their advice.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're open to all my advice.
[SPEAKER_08]: And together we grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just how I think about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't care if you're 20 or you're 60.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to learn something from a
conversation because we are not at that
[SPEAKER_08]: same age.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not experiencing things at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are like the plants you were
explaining.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like taking one and taking another and
putting them in two separate environments.
[SPEAKER_08]: And even if they're the same strain,
they're going to grow different.
[SPEAKER_08]: So and I got a whole bunch of strains.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis beauty is a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'm taking the best out of each
plant that's in front of me and I'm
[SPEAKER_08]: creating something amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm creating a happy miracle or what do
you call those happy accidents or no,
[SPEAKER_08]: they're not accidents.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're happy miracles.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you can keep the happy accidents.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm cool with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a huge Bob Ross fan and we do not make
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We only make happy little accidents.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I grew up in an environment where if
you weren't a mom, you could never give
[SPEAKER_08]: advice to a mom.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you would hear something like,
oh, if you don't got a kid, you don't
[SPEAKER_08]: you'll never understand.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's that's a false statement.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, some of the best advice you can
get as a mom comes from someone who isn't
[SPEAKER_08]: a mom because they they're not jaded.
[SPEAKER_08]: They haven't lost sleep.
[SPEAKER_08]: They haven't sacrificed for their they
haven't gone through that.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not jaded.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the most innocent.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like sometimes Tony will say, oh,
why don't you ask Marcos like this?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, I didn't even think about
that because she's not dealing with those
[SPEAKER_08]: stresses.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's easy to just sit back and give
almost the most innocent point of view.
[SPEAKER_08]: So who am I to tell someone they don't
have a right to give me advice?
[SPEAKER_08]: What if that advice is the most best life
changing I could get?
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to stay open the same way you open
up your mind to different strains when you
[SPEAKER_08]: go to a dispensary and you're you're
willing to just to you're willing to
[SPEAKER_08]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like you got to do that with
people.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just got to be willing to experiment
with different people and see where it
[SPEAKER_08]: takes you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's pushed you?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's driven your confidence and helped
you out more than anything else?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't need anybody to approve or
validate who I am.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's up to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And once I stopped waiting for people to
like me and I started to like myself,
[SPEAKER_08]: I realized that I had been in my own way
the whole time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not looking now for anyone to tell me
what they want to see from me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to give them what they got.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to give you what I got.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you stay or stay, if you don't,
you don't.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've learned to be good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about you, Kaniyia?
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, like I just don't listen to
anybody else bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just listen to my own.
[SPEAKER_03]: My own self, my own God and my,
you know, because all the other noise is
[SPEAKER_03]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Noise.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know what I like, I guess I need and
I and I just block everything else out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the best advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You focus on those stressors.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to become stressed,
it's not helping you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's nothing you can do to change
something, there's no reason to waste your
[SPEAKER_02]: time stressing out about it, because you
can do nothing about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are going to not like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are not going to like some of the
decisions that you make.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as long as you're cool with what you
did, you need to stick to that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't give a fuck what anybody else
thinks, because it's not about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not there to have them criticize
what you're doing to change it or warp it
[SPEAKER_02]: into something that you did not intend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always block the noise.
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be the best piece of advice I
would give someone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't share every idea with everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some ideas just need to keep to yourself.
[SPEAKER_08]: And hold sacred because not everybody is
supposed to understand your journey.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so sometimes the opinion of opinion of
others could really block the blessings
[SPEAKER_08]: that are right in front of you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So sometimes the ideas that you have as
enthusiastic as you are, you have to be
[SPEAKER_08]: able to bring that in for a minute and
take time to focus on it before you share
[SPEAKER_08]: it with the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not everybody deserves a seat at your
table.
[SPEAKER_08]: They really have to earn it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, don't give that away so freely.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my biggest advice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't give away your talent so freely and
even your respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a damn good piece of advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for saying that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually could use that.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, you're helping me out just as much as
I help you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something I love about both of
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of sorry, I'm going to say both of
you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something I love about both of y
'all is you're very, very strong,
[SPEAKER_02]: independent women, but you are also very
inclusive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you were saying, when I first met
both of you, you guys were doing lives
[SPEAKER_02]: that you do regularly with all of your
cannabis beauties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's always a different, you know,
arrangement of y'all, but you all have
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you all bring something to the table
that's a little bit different,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you're all there for the same reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what attracted me to you guys
is live so much right from the get go is
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of fucking mainly
sisterhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say, yes, there's some men in
there, but there's a lot of sisterhood
[SPEAKER_02]: beyond all of y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even the men that you hang out with,
you're very, very close with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you guys, especially with how close
you are when you start going off on stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we just did with the fucking nut
muffins.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when I just go crazy is because you
guys did such a good job at talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, being serious, going in depth
about different things that have helped
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you just go off the rails and
that's exactly how I like my podcast as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys all did an awesome job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your story is extremely moving,
Mel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, already know how I feel about
you and your story.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are one of the strongest women that
I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just got mass respect for both of
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get going here through all your
years of cannabis, what's been your
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite thing you've ever smoked?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll let Sarah go first.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to say I remember smoking
something like Skywalker OG way back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The OGness obviously, but it was
definitely, definitely a head high,
[SPEAKER_03]: but like also a body high.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Santulli's blueberry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hands down, Santulli's blueberry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I smoked it at her house back.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a day before my birthday.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll never forget.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Friday, May 13th.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I sat there in her, on her sofa and I
took that first poll from a white owl and
[SPEAKER_08]: instantaneously my head got fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_08]: My body pain relaxed and it was like,
everything was okay with the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: And she sent me home with a little gift.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I cried when that stream was gone,
but long and behold, she gave me a clone
[SPEAKER_08]: and I'm growing it in my own backyard now.
[SPEAKER_08]: That blueberry has my heart and it's from
Santulli.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love a good blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Santulli just came into the discord not
long ago too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen a couple of her growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's doing very, very well.
[SPEAKER_08]: She is very dope.
[SPEAKER_08]: Her and Sarah, amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there anybody you guys want to shout
out before we get going here?
[SPEAKER_03]: My little sister Stoney.
[SPEAKER_03]: She found some love and I just want to
give her a shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love her.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took her to find love and I'm really
happy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to shout out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to shout out all my Canada boss
beauties.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to shout out my husband and my
three boys and my dogs for putting up with
[SPEAKER_08]: my crazy self and shout out to you doc and

[SPEAKER_08]: Y'all dope.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we're all such a dope vibe and I love
y'all.
[SPEAKER_08]: I truly do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you both for taking the time out of
your days to come do this with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was an awesome episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a lot of fun with both of you all.
[SPEAKER_02]: This edible should be kicking in very,
very soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I might even do an IG live later.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this will be edited very soon and
it'll be available to all of you on
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube probably within the next couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So look forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you missed any part of this live,
you can go back in a couple of weeks and
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll see it fully edited with all the
fun effects and transitions and crazy shit
[SPEAKER_02]: that we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get going, I want to give a
quick shout out to the Canada boss
[SPEAKER_02]: beauties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously you can go find canna cure
inspired over on IG at canna cured
[SPEAKER_02]: underscore inspired.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find canna Queenie at canna dot
Queenie to ease to ease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of them are very, very awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a shout out to all my
Patreon members as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are the life behind this and I could
not do it without you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You all are fucking awesome and you've
gone above and beyond to help me build
[SPEAKER_02]: this into what it is now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got much, much love for all of my
members.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canna Queenie being one of them over
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously Pink Tank, KW, I couldn't even
go on forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Roger for being with me for so fucking
long.
