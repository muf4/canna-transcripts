[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, go ahead here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I hear a dab going.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, oh, I hear a dab going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna ask you about that if you did
much concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, more than most people, but less than
some.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody, and welcome to
another exciting episode of the Calix and
[SPEAKER_00]: Crew podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a very special guest today,
none other than the man himself,
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeder Steve, a man that is from Ontario,
has been growing since 89, started Spice
[SPEAKER_00]: of Life Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's here to talk to us today about a
little bit about his history, and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to talk about what he's doing now
and everything in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, Steve, for taking this time
today to join us and talk to us about you
[SPEAKER_00]: and what you've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me, Doug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you, you know,
for everybody that's following right now
[SPEAKER_00]: that has no idea who Spice of Life is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got so many generations of growers
over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that's not familiar with Spice of
Life, do you want to give us a little
[SPEAKER_00]: background about how you got started
growing and how that became Spice of Life
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I started growing my own,
really like 89, 90, there was no easy
[SPEAKER_02]: access to clones or seeds for the average
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to, you know, network a little bit
to find some.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't just go to a shop or go on
the internet and order them, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was imperative that if you found
something you liked, that you started to
[SPEAKER_02]: save some seed of it, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just got in as a hobbyist,
out of necessity, saving seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And trying to cross this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would just do, you know, a branch on
the bottom here and there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had like a film canister of seed,
which was used back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I moved to Vancouver after
university, Mark Emery was there from,
[SPEAKER_02]: also from London.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember his City Lights bookstore
and that because he was the first one
[SPEAKER_02]: selling High Times or True Life.
[SPEAKER_02]: True Life crew, and that was prohibited,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I was always aware of the
dude, but I didn't know him or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he had the hemp BC.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd got busted selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was the only guy selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought it was, you know,
hey, if this guy wants to keep selling
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds, I should donate him some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went down and I took a film canister
of seeds and just said, I know you got
[SPEAKER_02]: busted selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to keep doing it,
I just wanted to donate a jar to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, well, what are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got pictures, descriptions,
anything I said, no, nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just see what people think.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, then I was in there a few months
later and picking up a magazine or papers
[SPEAKER_02]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, hey, you gave me those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: People really like them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make as many as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep bringing me seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, oh, you could actually do
that as a business because I was purely a
[SPEAKER_02]: hobbyist.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just figured I'd work in other
things and just be a hobbyist forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the reasons I moved to
Vancouver, it was the only place in
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody was in jail for growing even
personal, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was the safe place to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as such, all the growers were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a very international city as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a real, you know,
melting pot of seeds pouring in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was seed from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd get Indian seed, Southeast Asian
seed, you know, all the West Coast stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, California and Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's just so much to choose from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while I got there, I just made a point
out of collecting any, cutting anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: with something or trying any seeds friends
gave me, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have lots of friends from around the
world that live there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was so fun, you know, that I was
just constantly playing with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't worried about cranking out big
pounds or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just love to start a lot of seeds and
look at all the different plants and then
[SPEAKER_02]: pack a whack in different jars,
you know, just have lots and just be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to share it and enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a hoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, you know,
most people were more into growing pounds
[SPEAKER_02]: of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, of course, you found something really
nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You made sure to get, man, I would love to
see this weed everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want these cuttings out there like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweets got cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You pass them around to get everybody
growing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'd see more of it in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it was great fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would give it to anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just sharing it with people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just saying, if you really like this
weed, you want to grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it takes 12 weeks to flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not your standard VC big bud or
whatever, but it just tastes heavenly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I say, I'll give it to you for free,
but just promise me you're going to give
[SPEAKER_02]: it to anybody else that wants it for free
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just get it out there, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's friendly wildfires over these cuts
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ones that I had that were like
super interesting for one reason or
[SPEAKER_02]: another, like a sterile plant where I
thought, oh my God, I should hang on to
[SPEAKER_02]: this and tell you that you can do
something with it officially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wouldn't share them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I would lose them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ones that I thought were too
special to share, which didn't last very
[SPEAKER_02]: long because I learned my lesson quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you put it out there, it's never
lost, you know, if it stands on its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if it stands on its own,
you'll still find it 25 years later.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's not worth keeping,
it'll be gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you try and keep it in too small a
circle or just by yourself, it's too easy
[SPEAKER_02]: to lose a really beauty cutting that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you those seeds that you
gave to Mark Emery, those first seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: you gave to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any recollection of what those
were?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were something I brought with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I called Medway Madness through the creek
outside London, Ontario or in London,
[SPEAKER_02]: Ontario.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my Medway Madness, but I rebranded
it out there because I said nobody's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to know what the hell Medway Madness is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I called it Jolly Rancher because it
was kind of sweet and tangy like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and it seemed like a happy name
for the Jolly Rancher.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the first one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I remember when he opened them up and
it was they were really, really big seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you didn't get as many in the canister
as if you get really small seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you open them up and he pulls it out
and he says, you're freaking coconuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they were they were like small peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really big seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, especially when you said a lot of
the stuff that was coming around right
[SPEAKER_00]: then was mostly land race heirloom type
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those carry small seed,
at least in my experience, but I've mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: worked with Asians and Pacifics and those
I haven't done very much South Americans
[SPEAKER_00]: or Mexicans like you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty damn cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of a lot of small seeds in
the tropical seed, but there is some big
[SPEAKER_02]: ones too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for hemp ones, a really fat one is
like the tropical hemp Yunnan,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Chinese one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are big beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, as a breeder, if you're
selling them by the seed, you're really
[SPEAKER_02]: happy with small ones because you harvest
them by the weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so if you harvest 10 kilos of
seeds, you know, you've got twice as many
[SPEAKER_02]: if they're small than if they're big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very, very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've seen some Indians that are
damn near like the end of a pin,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just tiny little black opals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're almost like poppy seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you follow up the Medway madness
with the sweet pink grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people don't know this,
but you do not claim creation to the sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: pink grapefruit at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I named it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a clone I collected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the clone was, I said, what do they
call it?
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing worth growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could tell that it was a sweet herb,
but it was always cut too early for my
[SPEAKER_02]: taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was kind of had a lot of orange hair
and it just it was underdeveloped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small calyx, you know, and I was like,
I bet you this would be nice if you got it
[SPEAKER_02]: finished and had a plump up, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really was wanting to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the girl I knew selling each of it,
she was like the exclusive seller of this
[SPEAKER_02]: guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was kind of a friend of a friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she'd she said, oh, yeah, he'll sell
you a trade on the minimum orders,
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 clones for five bucks each or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I first moved there,
just sit in my apartment and send anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: that means somebody selling clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was always lots of people
because we go down to Red Beach and places
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like every day you could go out and find
foreign people to sell you some clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a hotbed at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still is, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyways, it was just so fun to collect
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just throw, you know, tag a
couple, keep as many moms in the
[SPEAKER_02]: collection and then flower the couple,
see if they're worth keeping, get rid of
[SPEAKER_02]: the ones you don't like and just keep
doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then before you know it, you say,
oh, these are my six favorite plants from
[SPEAKER_02]: the last year or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and and you can pop in seeds on
the side, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's nice to collect the clones that
are going around town and then just see
[SPEAKER_02]: who grows it better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and then it's like a one design
race when everybody's growing that same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the but when I first flowered
that out was on my balcony in my first
[SPEAKER_02]: apartment in Kitsilano that was on
Broadway and U.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were just on the second floor,
but I had a really spacious balcony there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people from taller towers across and
people on the bus and stuff would go by
[SPEAKER_02]: wave because I had this balcony covered in
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even on the railing, I had 21 gallon
pots with the 20 grapefruits.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, maybe 19.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I kept one as a mom in the closet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then then these ones that were the
only thing worth growing, just spread
[SPEAKER_02]: along the rail of the balcony and just
growing the plump little things,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and maybe one ounce plants or
something, the chunky little things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would ask people because I let it go
and it was smelling super, super sweet
[SPEAKER_02]: pink grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just said this like a ruby red that you
just covered in white sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: People would come over and I had like 20
different plants on the balcony,
[SPEAKER_02]: not counting those and tomatoes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first people would come out and
see tomato.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they kind of realize,
holy shit, this is all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say, smell those ones on the
rail and tell me what they smell like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 20 out of 20 people went, sweet pink
grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, everybody said it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was just to me, I was like,
well, SPG.
[SPEAKER_02]: They made a fresh label on that,
the SPG, sweet pink grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it didn't have a name for it,
so it needed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, that's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I think that what I've heard
various lore and legends of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: that it was like 17 years on the islands
after being 17 years out of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: or grown in Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that it was some early Northern Lights
language.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's entirely plausible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I have no way of knowing for
absolute dead certainty, but I think
[SPEAKER_02]: through the sequencing and everything that
they've pretty much determined it was an
[SPEAKER_02]: early Northern Lights one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had been so, it was a pleasant
smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a pleasant smoke in that it doesn't
put the hurt on people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice at a party because it lights up
a party and people are social and happy
[SPEAKER_02]: and chatty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas you can bring in something heavier
and then everybody's just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: stupefied.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's nice to have that light
pleasant hurt that is maybe 20% THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: not super strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they probably, when I've seen it
tested from different people's tests,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was anywhere from 17 to 22 or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say the average 19, 20, 21 is probably
the most common for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's possible to get it a little
stronger too, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the strongest batches, I don't,
you know, never had them tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a nice happy herd.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a, I think I almost want to make
like red hats with the white letters that
[SPEAKER_02]: say, make cannabis sweet again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't see so much of the candied
flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have had some in the last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the Hellu Jelly from Humboldt seed
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just had met the guy that,
the head of, Mauricio Nami down in
Columbia.
He's Colombian American.
And they have a Hellu Jelly.
He was telling me about it, but he didn't
have me with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another friend here from Vernon
Drake, he came to visit me in the summer
[SPEAKER_02]: and he brought me a few different flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of them was Hellu Jelly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two Finos actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the Finos was really nice and,
you know, jelly-like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love the sweet fruity stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do love the floral stuff as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have to be sweet and fruity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind a little spice or even the
pineys and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many permutations of aroma and
flavor in the species.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a joy to, you know, weave your
way through them and you start leaning to
[SPEAKER_02]: certain departments.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some people really want that
heavy rank and some people want the real
[SPEAKER_02]: ethereal light, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really have a thing for the
narrow-leaf plants with what I call the
[SPEAKER_02]: high tones, you know, that they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get those notes in weed that
doesn't take 16 weeks to flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these aromas and the undiluted
versions of them, let's say.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get hints of them crossed down
with the Afghanicas in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, that family of plants,
the Afghanica plants, which form a
[SPEAKER_02]: backbone of all indoor breeding,
you know, by and large, and modern
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding in general, they've been such a
huge contribution to potency and yield
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, hardiness in certain
conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're, of course, absolutely not
jungle plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take those plants to the tropics,
forget it, you know, if they're just going
[SPEAKER_02]: to mold, because they're designed to catch
and hold water, not to shed it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need these pencil-thin things and
they have, they're not always exquisite.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had some pencil-thin ones that I
couldn't stand the smell of, I think in
[SPEAKER_02]: Indonesia in particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: But overall, I would say my real passion
is chasing the tall, skinny girls on this
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're just so special.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely where my heart lies,
is with the more equatorial sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been something that I really,
really love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought of a question that I had no
intention of asking you, but since you
[SPEAKER_00]: brought it up, I want to know what your
thought process is on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and many others knowing you for now
have running tens of hundreds of thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, I think you would know more
than anybody One of my idols once told me
[SPEAKER_00]: that they saw a link trait between heavy
hermaphrodism and the stinky smelly plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and saw less of that in the sweet phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen anything similar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think it's equally possible
across the board?
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, my experience is that it's
equally, you know, I haven't never,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not saying he's wrong,
I'm just saying I've never made a
[SPEAKER_02]: correlation there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's never hit me, but that was the
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an interesting theory, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I thought so too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen hermaphrodites all across the
board, depending on, I think it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: based upon the breeder in the,
the amount of effort that they put into
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting and knowing their cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of the, I never sold
feminized seeds, you know, and I was
[SPEAKER_02]: ruthless about killing hermaphrodites back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really think, I think the only one I
ever had that I let through for sheer
[SPEAKER_02]: potency at a really low amount was the
P-19, the mother of the blockhead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one was, it was so unique and so
punchy, but if you did stress it too much,
[SPEAKER_02]: you would see if you, I never,
I didn't have a problem getting seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, hermaphrodite seed,
if I did it since in the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I've heard, you know, from people I'd
give the cuttings to where they were
[SPEAKER_02]: really cold or whatnot, they would start
with an A and on certain to get a herm on
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never saw it in my hot greenhouse where
it was totally happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see it, but when I heard one or
two people tell me that I still didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to get rid of it because it was one
of the highest THC things in the stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, this is really punchy and
it doesn't smell or taste like anything
[SPEAKER_02]: else.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really unusual.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a neat plant, the blockhead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really liked the blockhead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the odd person mention it that they
were saying, you know, that's the only one
[SPEAKER_02]: of your seeds I ever got hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never got one in your sweet toons,
never got one in your shishkeberry,
[SPEAKER_02]: never got one in the tropical trees or
tropical tamas or any of the other things,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the blockhead, I got a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're like, the rest of them are
awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to release them, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, but overall I've had a real
prejudice against them, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like because I don't like a seed popping
in my joint, I'm a smoker first and
[SPEAKER_02]: foremost, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just ruins a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's not even funny, like funny,
funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny, sad, but I see legal market
joints in Canada with seeds popping in
[SPEAKER_02]: them that people are cutting open joints
with seeds, like half the weight of the
[SPEAKER_02]: joint being seeds and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from one producer twice on different
batches, six months apart with different
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, how can you do pre-rolls
with half the weight seed and not notice?
[SPEAKER_02]: Half the weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like the guy weighed him and it was
like a one grain joint that was 0.49 seed
[SPEAKER_02]: and 0.51 shake, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: It just looked awful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was this in Canada?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then somebody else gifted me some.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't even remember whose it was or
anything, because I'm not that familiar
[SPEAKER_02]: with all the brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was really appalled because he
pulled it out and said, here, this is a
[SPEAKER_02]: really nice joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a $15 joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think of joints like, you know,
10 cents or whatever, because I grew my
[SPEAKER_02]: own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like $15 joints, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I smoked the thing and it popped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you fucking kidding me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like get it together, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't be a professional bud sales
and sell seed in your bud, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought the only smart way you could do
that is in Canada, they overtax seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a dollar seed excise tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's ridiculous in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't get my head around playing that
game because I want to sell seeds for less
[SPEAKER_02]: than that, like taxes on flowers,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the thing that drives me nuts is why
should they get 50, 60 thousand a kilo
[SPEAKER_02]: from your seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's you taxing the unborn.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't even know if it's a male or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like give me a break.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to tax the seed and it's not
even alive yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might not sprout.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just overreach.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's appalling overreach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if I have to ask you or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's you know, that's a reason why I
vitalized you and your work is because
[SPEAKER_00]: you've always put quality first and
foremost.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about new seed companies,
a lot of them coming out, a lot of them
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, a lot of them coming out or saying
there's no need to test these if we knew
[SPEAKER_00]: the mother was good, we knew the father
was good and there's no reason to test
[SPEAKER_00]: these seeds because there's a certain
amount of instability that is in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and it will always be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, ideally you want to test it first,
but I absolutely sympathize with people
[SPEAKER_02]: who know that they're like the mother's
killer, the father's killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter what, the fucking kids are going
to look good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what they're going to look
like, but they're going to look good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to play that game,
that's your brand to play with,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really all that's happening in
you know, the bleeding edge, I think,
[SPEAKER_02]: of the hype is always you have to be the
newest of the new news.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got to get the newest and cross
them before anybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's the newest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's this like arms race to have the
next inevitable crosses made on the road
[SPEAKER_02]: to homogenization.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time it's all mixed together,
it will eventually all be the same anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's awesome because you think like a
million monkeys if you come up with
[SPEAKER_02]: Shakespeare, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: A million monkeys with their freighters.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how it's survived.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it's evolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, all of us growers saving
seeds for whatever turns us on about those
[SPEAKER_02]: plants all over the world for millennia
and millennia, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just a little link in a very long
chain, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all get to make some picks and make
some crosses and put our stamp on it for
[SPEAKER_02]: the next generation, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of us will do more of it than
others, but it's just as long,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if you're into it, definitely do
some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make one for yourself, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Find your favorites and make something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really encourage people to breed their
own.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's how I started Pure Out a
Hobby.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really, you know, I didn't go far
with breeding and formal education.
[SPEAKER_02]: I studied other things, but I employed PhD
breeders and master agronomists and all
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I learned so much from my staff all
the time, you know, because I'm not the
[SPEAKER_02]: most versed in molecular genomics,
but I'm totally stoked to read great links
[SPEAKER_02]: and to learn about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know because I have looked at it for
quite a while what can be done with it,
[SPEAKER_02]: like long before we could ever get our
hands near it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, 20 years ago I'd sit in my
office in Switzerland and be reading about
[SPEAKER_02]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, if we could only do this, you know,
think of what we could do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at that time it was like if you
weren't, you know, a big government like
[SPEAKER_02]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: or Monsanto or somebody, you were not
sequencing anything, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's become so affordable and
available that it's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's beautiful, beautiful to see the
world, you know, catching up with cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: as what it was meant to be is just for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been locked down for 100 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as it comes back up, it gets to enter
the modern world with all the stuff it
[SPEAKER_02]: hasn't been able to access when it was
underground, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the attention that it's getting in
research circles now, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in so many types of research from
medicine, you know, not just in growing in
[SPEAKER_02]: that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so astounding to see how mainstream
it's become.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I still pinch myself sometimes
that, you know, we're living in the times
[SPEAKER_02]: we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's been hellish for so many,
but it seems to be turning the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still hellish for so many.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's face it, for the majority it's still
horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely a blessing that's been
bestowed upon a lot of the world that you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our Patreon members, Jesse James
from Australia, wants to follow up with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's got their own, you know,
checkbox of what they want and what they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to breed forward to.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to know how do you test your
plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have in-house at the main farm,
we have, I'm trying to think of the brand
[SPEAKER_02]: of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's a Korean one, but I forget
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have a GC and an LC there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can test for cannabinoids and
terpenes on site.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the genomas send off samples,
but I don't know which labs they're using
[SPEAKER_02]: because they interpret them for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say I need genetics interpreters
because I can't read a sequencing report.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can segregate the traits and say,
okay, I know that group A is all purple
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and group B is all green plants,
but I'm not going to tell them what the
[SPEAKER_02]: trait is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just send you off group A and group B
samples and you've got 50 tissue samples
[SPEAKER_02]: of each.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll analyze them and then do a
comparative analysis to see which plasmid
[SPEAKER_02]: is different, which section of the
chromosome is different in these groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you say, okay, then you can tell
them this one's purple, this one's green.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can do that with resistance to any
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a mildew resistant plant or
virus resistant plant, and then you have
[SPEAKER_02]: ones that are susceptible, but they're
sisters and they're otherwise pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that some are better against the
mildew than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how those types of genes get
identified.
[SPEAKER_02]: You segregate the plants and then look for
the common denominator in each group
[SPEAKER_02]: that's different from the other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how we do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can develop once you have no,
I don't know if it's proteins or enzymes,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever they need to turn the colors,
they can do one-off dropper kits where you
[SPEAKER_02]: can pulverize the sample and say,
you can put a drop in and it either stays
[SPEAKER_02]: blue if it's a male or turns pink if it's
a female.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do these single tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you can develop them, it's not like
either automatic, but you have to know
[SPEAKER_02]: something about the biochemistry,
which I could never figure out in the life
[SPEAKER_02]: of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't know exactly how you go about
going, oh, well to break down this enzyme
[SPEAKER_02]: into pink, we need this or to make this
one flip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how that stuff works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what I want them to do and they
figure out how it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would First Plant Steve think about
Steve now?
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these different pieces of
equipment that you have access to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to do what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever think, hey, was there a point
where you had so much passion and you were
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I'm going to take it to this level?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I was still thinking of it as a
hobbyist that I wanted to do it hardcore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I was in university was really
when I got at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to university a year early.
[SPEAKER_02]: I finished high school in four years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really when I got into growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went there to do constitutional law
thinking that would help me legalize her.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after sitting through the classes and
the people, and I felt like it was just
[SPEAKER_02]: such a square environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was more of a daily doser kind of
guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, even though I want to really
understand all this, I can't let you have
[SPEAKER_01]: your own day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, I couldn't get my head around
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say, you know, what is the
legitimacy of all this constitution?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where does it come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, okay, from a king or queen
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where does their legitimacy come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, from some God botherer in a funny hat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, give me a break.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is in fairy tale.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: The land's founded on genocide.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no other way to put it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, where's the legitimacy of this
institution?
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, it lacks legitimacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I say, the best I got to accept is it's
like a mafia that rules the land and
[SPEAKER_02]: extorts the people and controls their
lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, you've just got to
bob and weave a little bit and just maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: one leg in, one leg out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure a lot of people be, you know,
enough to stay somewhat sane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because to me, it's just, once you kind of
look at the big picture, it's quite scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you think, oh man, this is whack.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I've been, I'm so far gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really dream of a post-national future
for all earthlings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think the nation states that
divide us are, you know, the biggest
[SPEAKER_02]: problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if it's the stains on our
planet, you know, let the earthlings be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you were coming up with a spice
alive seed company, was there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I would love to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a company.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just spice alive seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't make it a company because then
it's part of the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really whack out there at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I have company.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the time, when I first started
that, it was really just a hobby.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was an activism, you know,
before it was actually really a business
[SPEAKER_02]: because I never really took a bunch of
money from that endeavor and bought
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: All I ever did was rent more houses to
breed more pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it all just rolled back into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just a joy doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it wasn't like I was buying a
new Ferrari every year with it or
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was never, you know, because I
always figured to us like, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you do accumulate a bunch from it,
then when they come and get you,
[SPEAKER_02]: they've got something to take and they're
more attractive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas if you've got nothing because you
just kept spending it on concert tickets
[SPEAKER_02]: and growing more weed, there's nothing for
them to take.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I was always like,
I never want them to come and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, we found the dude with a bunch of cash
and keep it spams, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What concerts were you spending it on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would go out to see bands in Vancouver
every night and, you know, just go to
[SPEAKER_02]: restaurants and have fun in town back in
the mid 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was quite a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that sounds like a great life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have any idols coming up in that
time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, there was a couple guys I
really should think, and one would be Ed
[SPEAKER_02]: Rosenthal and Mel Frank, or two,
I guess, because I remember their book was
[SPEAKER_02]: the first one I'd read.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd ordered it at the same time I
ordered Marijuana Botany with Robert
[SPEAKER_02]: Connell Clark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ordered those like with money orders
out of the back of a high times.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm sure then got them mailed to
me at university.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I read their books and really back to
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had the Grower's Guide and then the
Marijuana Botany, which is more about
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was hooked to it simultaneously,
you know, I was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was obvious to me, I had to do both,
not just one, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really felt compelled.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I still, you know, grow a little sense
crop with 400 watts under the stairwell in
[SPEAKER_02]: the student house, you know, wouldn't
bother making seeds in there or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for keeping like an envelope of pollen
and just seeding a bottom branch of a big
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor bed on a day when it's not windy,
you know, just hit the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just have seed in the bottom
branch and the rest of it would be sense,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was good at just, you know,
selectively seeding different branches for
[SPEAKER_02]: having a bunch of different crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would give you a jar of each,
which is more than I needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody always wanted to buy my
homegrown because I would eat really hit
[SPEAKER_02]: it out of the park with nice 12 type
organic mix type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always good at picking a sunny site and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would never sell my homegrown
because you can't replace it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but I would always tell people,
if you want to do it, here's a one page on
[SPEAKER_02]: how to mix the soil and plant a hole and
pick a site and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a one page how to and I'll give you
20 seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just you go and do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you get it figured out,
teach other people how to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it really was just wanting to
get it out there and keep it alive because
[SPEAKER_02]: all the forces that be in the world were
trying to make the species extinct,
[SPEAKER_02]: which, you know, if that isn't proof
enough of their, you know, lack of
[SPEAKER_02]: legitimacy, you know, what right do they
have to exist as legal fiction to outlaw a
[SPEAKER_02]: species?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to get some hurrays in the
chat?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody agrees with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are on the right podcast, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man, I vibe with you a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked before the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you had your own winery for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really got into wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of your favorite wines?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just started getting into wine a couple
of years ago, seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I like all of them pretty much if
they're done really, really well,
[SPEAKER_02]: like any type of wine or any region.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always nice to have the best of any
region, you know, because like a reason
[SPEAKER_02]: from the Alsace is great if it's a really
nice one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even from Niagara, too, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the other hand, you get a very
different cabsove in Napa than you do in
[SPEAKER_02]: Niagara.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a whole lot to choose from in
wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the wine, I always figured it was
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started to love wine when I moved to
Switzerland to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just sort of learned about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first wine tour was in Burgundy with a
friend from Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd been going every month since he was
five with his dad to buy their household
[SPEAKER_02]: wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he knew Burgundy like the back of
his hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was really an eye-opener for me that
trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was only like my first year
living in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then later, once we had kids,
he said, you know, when the Swiss place
[SPEAKER_02]: started to be a hassle, he said,
let's just change gears and try making
[SPEAKER_02]: wine for a while while the kids are young
and do something non-controversial.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I figured out by the time I learned to
make wine and get good at that,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll learn something about the because I
figured when cannabis was legal,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was going to fall into place much like
the winery business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually it is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like now they're going to allow the craft
of growers to open up direct sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you're a craft grower and you
can only sell to the government,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're pretty screwed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have any bargaining power there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas if you have direct to the public,
you have closer to what the market will
[SPEAKER_02]: bear for what you're growing and you get a
better spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how in BC, that's how the
wineries, if they're land-based wineries,
[SPEAKER_02]: they can sell direct to the public and
they only pay sales tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no excise tax on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can have tastings and people can
come and buy some and go sit up on the
[SPEAKER_02]: hill and enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought this is exactly what cannabis is
going to be like when it's legal in
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't be like what I had in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here they'll license it and they'll tax
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's fine if it's reasonable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can live with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's too much, it's just
embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a parallel universe of flavorful
intoxicants making wine because you're
[SPEAKER_02]: growing something to make something that's
smells great and tastes great and has an
[SPEAKER_02]: effect and ostensibly some medical benefit
too in moderation, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: A glass of red wine a day or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just an appreciate for terpenes and
being able to pull out all those flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was funny, while I was in
Switzerland, I was in an area where they
[SPEAKER_02]: only grew Merlot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole valley was Merlot basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all the grapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the different country restaurants
had their own Merlot and they didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: bottle it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a jug at the table with your
dinner, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they drank it out of Bokalini.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look like little finger bowls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people didn't believe me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've had guests come in and they see me
drinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're drinking out of a finger bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no, that's Bokalini.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how they drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'd give me like a ceramic jug with
a liter of wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like 20 francs, which was like 20
Canadian white.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you judge these restaurants,
not just on their food, but by their wine,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it was literally their wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You park by the vines and just walk in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was very rustic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really thought it was super cool how
that was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of them would never bottle their
wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I realized, boy, they've got all the
good grow sites too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you remember from way back when you
had to hide your plants, the most
[SPEAKER_02]: successful commercial pot production was
always blended in to other agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the common thing would be corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course they'd look in corn because
everybody grows their wheat in the corn,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But in vineyards is not quite as common,
but it's still done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can grow wheat in a vineyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got 100 acres of irrigated
drip line and trellising all out there and
[SPEAKER_02]: another cover crop, you can easily put in
10 acres of wheat if you did every 10th
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or every 20th.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant would be like five acres of
wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how the large scale commercial
production has always been done,
[SPEAKER_02]: is blended with other agriculture so that
it can be right out in the open and worked
[SPEAKER_02]: on openly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't go and hide a field in the bush.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can only hide a field within a field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how it used to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, I thought if I had a vineyard,
I could start testing out some plants in
[SPEAKER_02]: the vineyards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they like growing with the vines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a friend in Switzerland that bought
a vineyard, ripped out all the plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: kept the trellising, which was in
Switzerland they had concrete posts with
[SPEAKER_02]: the steel wires.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the neighbors were all really
pissed because it was surrounded by
[SPEAKER_02]: apartment buildings.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was this big vineyard in between
apartment buildings.
[SPEAKER_02]: He ripped it all out and planted wheat in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the people were really pissed because
they liked the view over the vineyard and
[SPEAKER_02]: they did not like the view and the aroma
from his urban fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy was Felix.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was in Locarno.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the funniest place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the craziest place.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was so funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have to bleep that out?
[SPEAKER_02]: That name?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, everybody will know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope he's well and I hope he's watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still do that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still planting cannabis in the
middle of the vineyard weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I swear to God, everything that I've
had out of those, something about the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology in the soil, it makes it
taste like vineyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had some excellent vineyard weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, one of my favorite ones I grew
in the vineyard was actually grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was one of the strongest ones I had
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was decent altitude and it was a hot
year and dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was, you know, all of those,
the grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a real hitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember too, that was like,
I remember having that thinking,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is maybe the strongest grapefruit
I've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've grown some good, strong
grapefruit before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like as strong as it could be,
I thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I pulled some out of the
vineyard, I had some friends that did put
[SPEAKER_02]: the herd on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hadn't seen that before.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, oh, that joint just
destroyed me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were losing their shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, it's not usually that
strong, but this is really exceptionally
[SPEAKER_02]: good for grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I never had that tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like to test that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always remember that in Switzerland,
seeing all these vineyards around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially because we'd have trouble with
rippers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd be growing like solid fields of it or
solid greenhouses of it or solid
[SPEAKER_02]: warehouses of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rippers were always a concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he got hit by some and definitely hit
some back.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thinking, boy, I bet you if I just
put them in these vineyards, you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, nobody even, no thief is going
in the vineyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not there to steal grapes,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: No thief is going in the vineyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought, I bet you they'd be safer
out there than behind the fence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Behind the fence, people like,
hey, what's in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: We gotta get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's greenhouses and weed
behind the fence.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the vineyard, they'd just walk right
past us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would never go look in the vineyard,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just too much work to go look up and
down the rows, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody had drones back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing in Ontario, the rippers
are so bad now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got drones all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people chasing, going in with flags,
just like, you know, the cops used to go
[SPEAKER_02]: in with the flags into the cornfield,
like the tall flags so the choppers can
[SPEAKER_02]: tell them where to go because they know
we're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, the rippers are doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, but I mean, the best thing is
just that you leave it alone until it's so
[SPEAKER_02]: ubiquitous that it's not worth stealing
just like grapes, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually had had people come and steal
grapes from the other the stuff that was
[SPEAKER_02]: growing over the fence.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had like a family that was taking them
to make their own wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, if you don't have a behind the
fence, people think it's fair game.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hidden in plain sight is a good way to
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're still somewhere where
you've got to hide your plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a great way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you were in France,
they don't even allow irrigation in the
[SPEAKER_02]: vineyards.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'd still be out there hanging
watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in British Columbia, the vineyard
wouldn't survive without water,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, not in the interior.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the, in Ontario, you don't use much
irrigation, I don't think, in the
[SPEAKER_02]: vineyards.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have drip lines out there,
you know, you got drip lines and trellises
[SPEAKER_00]: and cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was telling you before the show that a
good friend of mine, Professor P and his
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy Solo Farms over in Massachusetts,
did a preservation of the grapefruit work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a picture that I wanted to
share.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a video that I wanted to show
you really quick of one that I grew out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that that was more leaning towards the
sweet pink, and one to see if it bared any
[SPEAKER_00]: resemblance to you to the old stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you've got my attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see the top again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see the stocks of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is an old video, see?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's an old video.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you were moving it around or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's believable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so it has, you know, the texture
of the leaves looks like it, the shape and
[SPEAKER_02]: size pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it starting again?
[SPEAKER_02]: You started again.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You did a good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it looks like pretty close.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a little pointier, but not too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that is good to hear, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will pass on that news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that was that was the main
phenotype that you were getting out of it
[SPEAKER_00]: was plants that were looking like that,
which is that rare one that I was telling
[SPEAKER_00]: you about earlier that was a little bit
more sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little bit more potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It leave you a little bit more head
buzzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, instead of the up head buzz,
it was that extreme, like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did they work it with?
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I don't want to misquote this,
because I feel like I keep getting it
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong, but I'm pretty sure Professor P had
the one that he called the inbred line or
[SPEAKER_00]: the the grapefruit inbred line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Solo over in Massachusetts had
the sweet pink grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that was from your stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he claimed that his was from your
stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they took those two that were kind of
unrelated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're both grapefruit,
different coastlines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they took them together and brought
them together to kind of open it back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And preserve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a little rounder top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those ones were a little pointier.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, those are a little bit pointier.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't look exactly like it,
but it's very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the type of resin on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it really looked like that kind
of velvet leaf kind of is a neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, just dead on ruby red
grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it yielded really, really well to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're chunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're chunky and they're tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what the people like about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you a funny story, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the, let's say, the mid to late
90s, there was a lot of really nice
[SPEAKER_02]: grapefruit and sweet tooth ending up in
New York City.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would then one time they took
some different weed that was a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: stronger and wasn't as tasty, but it was
stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, the next time they were
back, they said, we don't want the strong
[SPEAKER_02]: one again.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a routine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We take 100 pounds of storage every
morning and break it down to 10 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go home that afternoon and break it
down to 10 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go take their pounds and then they
sell ounces or so to the guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone else's to sell eats and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they break it down and says,
the guy comes home from work to like
[SPEAKER_02]: career comes over with his $85 eight,
you know, and it's so tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just like, I have another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just hit bong rip after bong rip
because it tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by midnight, it's all gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next day, the whole cycle starts
over.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he said, when you put the real potent
stuff in that round, it took them two days
[SPEAKER_02]: to finish it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a cool thing is there's a type of
cannabis for damn near any time of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And OK, that brings up a point I did
really want to ask you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of breeders that I know lay claim
that breeding with feminized seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding with S1 is kind of dirtying up
the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think overreliance on S1s has put
a lot more arms out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never been a big fan of them and I
never sold them seeds, but the market,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course, demands them at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really just getting to be crucial
around the time I was taking a break,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, retired from the seed business
for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I've been making them for five plus,
but I haven't got back in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually had my first hemp seed at one
of my companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the first time I ever made a hemp
seed and it's a feminized hemp line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that came out in the fall as a
registered hemp seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next registered seed we have
coming out is a company like my company in
[SPEAKER_02]: Columbia that is not just me, of course,
but it's a one to one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this something that we can look forward
to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those will be out there literally being
harvested this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just posted a picture, I think,
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll post a picture of it on Twitter
maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was this one to one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if memory serves, that one was a 15 to
15 for your THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a pretty plant and I hope people
like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not spice of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, you know, it's its own brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, it'll be white labeled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the first batch coming out,
the first commercial batch won't be an
[SPEAKER_02]: enormous one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now it's registered.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll get those out there and get
people to see how the demand is for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then produce a lot more so they can be
really inexpensive and broadly available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can tell you there's somebody
already looking forward to that because I
[SPEAKER_00]: really enjoy one to ones in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's become like, it's been, it's like my
morning coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it doesn't get you blasted out of
your mind, but it equalizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried a bit, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, of course, but they don't really
hit me at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like any of the ratio plants, I usually
like, oh, that was just a waste of oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I just don't get enough off it
to float my boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had one that was neat that, instead of
the same, I have friends that absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: adored it, that they were there and they
can't smoke the high THC stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had some plenty of outdoor that was
over 30%.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have rock solid outdoor down
there that can be as good as anything out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's absolutely stunning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I smoke, you know, I won't even
reach for the strongest one all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll often reach for one of the tastier
ones that are, you know, mid twenties
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of low thirties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the low thirties too, it's a
different smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not as fruity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I find the strongest ones aren't to
me as tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like them and they have a very distinct
taste, but it's a lot more austere.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's not, it's like what they
come with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the strong plants always come
with that, well, that cleaner,
[SPEAKER_02]: like really a pungent, you know,
piney cleaner kind of smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more astringent than pleasant to me,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can appreciate it for being the
astringent beast it is because I know it
[SPEAKER_02]: totally gives me the headband and the
sweats.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh my God, I can't feel my
legs from the knees down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives me really stoned, that proper
fuel pot there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I take like a spike punch or
something, maybe 26%, that tastes really
[SPEAKER_02]: nice, then I far prefer that, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm still lit, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not like, I need to turn my phone
off for half an hour later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But down Twitter, Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So speaking of some of your favorite types
here, what are some of your favorite types
[SPEAKER_00]: that you did not create?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, easily my my lifelong love of
cannabis has been Santa Marta bold without
[SPEAKER_02]: a doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's she's so nice and there's there's
didn't you do a release that was a Santa
[SPEAKER_05]: Marta goal?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I had, you know, my biggest one of
my biggest regrets in cannabis collecting
[SPEAKER_02]: was when I had it pure, not knowing what
it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I had seeds that was gifted to me from
a friend of a friend who said this was the
[SPEAKER_02]: best weed I'd ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was on holidays in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was golden and sticky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, the best weed I've ever
smoked, give it to your friend,
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grows very weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it to him, see what he can do with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he gave.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my friend brought me these seeds and
his name is Lionel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I called it Lionel's killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it changed to Lionel's killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that was what it was grown as it
just said LK on it for Lionel's killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they and as it grew, it was growing
with all this other stuff that took on
[SPEAKER_02]: average eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't flowering, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, oh, you thought this stuff
is so skinny and so slow, but it's got a
[SPEAKER_01]: compelling smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you rub the stalk in that and the
leaves were just pinite, like really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really thin and paler.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had the male and females,
the guy had two males and two females or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, well, it's totally unusual,
but I'm going to leave it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I just kept the male away,
it didn't do anything with the male.
[SPEAKER_02]: I let them grow just to have them a sense
these two females.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had backup mothers of them and
fathers at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I grew them out and I.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took 16 weeks to flower and they were
absolute pencils, but they smelled like
[SPEAKER_02]: cherry pie filling or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just exotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had I packed them into a glass
spaghetti noodle jar, one of the tall
[SPEAKER_02]: jars, and I packed them in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess it was maybe two ounces,
but they were just tiny, thin,
[SPEAKER_02]: thin buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they took 16 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't share them with my best
friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't share it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was not getting seen in my bedroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would like go up there in the
morning, wake up in the morning and smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: on there before I even left my room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like, oh, this is this is too good
to share.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I was like, OK, this stuff's
magical.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to make some seeds with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But instead of making a pure batch and
keeping it pure, I said, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: nobody's ever going to want these because
they're too skinny and they take too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of making a pure batch,
which I could have easily done to the
[SPEAKER_02]: first, I did the male Santa Marta gold
with a Dutch treat, which was fast and
[SPEAKER_02]: frosty and compact.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I crossed it with a Dutch treat and
that was tropical treat one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could have easily put the female at
the same time and got a pure batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was too stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did the female separately and I used
the same male, which turned out to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: northern light haze that was the father of
the sweet scone, strawberry blonde and
[SPEAKER_02]: some other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was tropical treat number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had the two lines of those came out
and I had pictures back from people
[SPEAKER_02]: growing them in Australia, in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were raving about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was like, they're still so
slow, though, you know, and I grew out of
[SPEAKER_02]: testimony that they're still so slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I crossed them later with Shishkeberry
and Sweet Tooth and called them Tropicana
[SPEAKER_02]: one and two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did those in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I was growing out the tropical
treats one and two in Switzerland,
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam the Skunk Man came for a visit one
time and had this really cool hermetic and
[SPEAKER_02]: sealed door to slide open into the back
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had 36 lights in the aquarium and a
total selection crop going on with a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: range of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like my first big seed selection
right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Sam came for a visit and he would open
the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: He saw those at the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, they're just against the wall
because they take two crops anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just put them at the back of the
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he went, oh, Santa Monica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and he just beeline for them,
you know, and he's now going, this is the
[SPEAKER_01]: best Santa Monica I've seen in decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did you get this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, oh, that's crossed out once
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, it's still pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I know it's really good still,
but it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have seen the parents,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I remember the parents like it was
yesterday with some of my favorite herb
[SPEAKER_02]: ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not shocking that that's the
genetic they had in Barbados that
[SPEAKER_02]: originated out of Columbia, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though it was grown in Barbados,
which I totally believe is a nice
[SPEAKER_02]: limestone, beautiful place to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen fantastic growth in Barbados.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow dynamite down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, the smell of it is so special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I've been back in Columbia six
years, trying to recreate, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: from every collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've collected Santa Marta Gold from 20
different people in 20 different places.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some lines are closer than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually I'll find like, okay,
one out of 20 is right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other 19 are shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to sift through them,
you know, and I'm continually doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have got some now that I'm pretty
proud of that are getting more and more
[SPEAKER_02]: like what I remember it to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually know some of the families
in the North Coast that were the people
[SPEAKER_02]: that were growing the Santa Marta Gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they, you know, they haven't seen it
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I send them pictures of here,
look how close this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that the guys that used to grow
it that are very old men now, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: still looking at these pictures and going,
go, go, go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're so stoked and their kids
have been to see it and that, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've gone and sat on the tractor,
like in the field where the best Santa
[SPEAKER_02]: Marta Gold supposedly came from,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been all explored the area,
the region of pretty, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: where it was best grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was grown really widely, but there was
some areas that were considered the best
[SPEAKER_02]: zones like Pinot Noir and Burgundy,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's considered a special place to have
it, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where it was, you know,
developed for X amount of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a true area and it's special.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd really love, I'd love to get it,
you know, it's been a real dream of mine
[SPEAKER_02]: to really restore it and make it available
for more people to see and experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it has these high notes that most
people haven't really been exposed to yet,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Hayes is a close friend of mine,
close as close people get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Hayes, original Yellow Hayes was pure
Santa Marta Gold, acclimatized in Santa
[SPEAKER_02]: Cruz, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it became the Green Hayes and
somebody, a guy, Michael, supposedly added
[SPEAKER_02]: the tie into it and it became the Green
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my understanding, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure somebody can correct me,
but that's...
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be along the lines of the Hayes
brothers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Presumably, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never talked to them, but I can't
say.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all hearsay for me, that's all I'm
saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from pretty good sources, like Sam the
Skypan, I remember what he told me about
[SPEAKER_02]: them, I hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was pretty simple with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's pretty obvious when you know what
Santa Marta Gold tastes like, that that's
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty close to what Hayes tastes like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you get the Yellow Hayes over the
Green Hayes, you notice a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like that popular Amnesia Hayes cut
that's out and around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had even the last three years in a
row is the only one that I've continually
[SPEAKER_02]: put three years in a row in my yard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't keep very many plants in my yard,
but a friend had given me one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, oh, give me a cut of that every
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's the closest thing to Santa
Marta Gold that'll finish in the Okanagan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because I do cheater outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're totally outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when the rains come, I pull them under
the porch, which is south facing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they never get rained on when they're
in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they still get a half day of sun or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not competitive environment by back
here because there's shade in the morning
[SPEAKER_02]: and shade later in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it gets the best part of the day,
it gets direct sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's cooking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they turned out good, my back yard
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm happy for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hobby thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I travel so much, so I can't bother having
an indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't even have a closet at
home.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, plus when you're home,
do you want to take your work home all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, of course I want to smoke at home
all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've got so much for growing in so
many places, but I've got so many skilled
[SPEAKER_02]: people working with me and taking care of
it up in the day to day that I've become
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel hands off until I have my
summer plants where I have my personal
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, you know, like hashtag pool,
but I just have a little joy for watering
[SPEAKER_02]: them myself, you know, rather than having
80 people on the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm never watering something
when I go to the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm walking around and making notes and
talking to people and taking pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not hands on with the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at least in my backyard, I get that
connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I feel like I've become too much
of an executive grower on some level,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, even executive breeder,
because I have breeders working for me
[SPEAKER_02]: that are far more qualified as far as
scholastically speaking, but they're
[SPEAKER_02]: freaked out because I can look at the stem
of a male sometimes and tell them what it
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, that's not normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have really a lot of fun working
together because they're from outside
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a real eye opener for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not as easy for me because I had
to teach them to grow in the first place
[SPEAKER_02]: and teach them what to look for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas in other projects, you know,
like in Thailand right now, I have Steve
[SPEAKER_02]: Reisner from Potent Ponics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's there on the ground taking care of
the plants, killing the shit ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: taking video shows, showing the whole
world what's going on on his YouTube
[SPEAKER_02]: channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get live, practically live updates
from the farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I get more from the Taiwan than from
the ones in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in Spain, they're more research based
crops right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have EU funding with the Basque
government.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have another project with the
Catalan government and we do genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: research and propagation work,
micro propagation work to do genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: embryogenesis and hopefully eventually in
suspension culture, because we do it now
[SPEAKER_02]: in petri dishes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to have, you know, the goal was
to do it in suspension culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the hardest type of tissue
culture to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, we're on it because like with
sterile plants, I can't make seeds for
[SPEAKER_02]: sterile plants, but I can make cuttings of
my sterile plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are at no risk of ever getting
seeded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they root in three or four days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're amazing plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can do that with just about any
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I get the different selections
sterile, then we'll get them registered
[SPEAKER_02]: and then hopefully distribute those as
artificial seeds or synthetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: People get scared when you say that,
you know, because they think you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: GMO or something and it's not like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's just, it can be a
convenient way to ship micro propagation,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to round back really quick,
would you say that amnesia haze was one of
[SPEAKER_00]: your favorites?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, that, you know, lately,
okay, I can see of backyard stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been a nice one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amnesia haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: This summer I had a creamsicle,
pie hole, chem glue, grandpa's breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Godbud, not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Godbud is a neat plant because it has some
really strong mildew resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a nice chunky frosty
appearance, but it hasn't had any flavor,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and I don't get any buzz from
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, it was very disappointing
because it looks so good, but it's just,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks to me deceiving people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm often skeptical of super frosty stuff
that it's going to be super tasty because
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had so many super frosty stuff that
was a real letdown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first time I saw that was White
Widow, where I remember thinking,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, this looks, I saw it when I first came
out of the first cannabis cup and Scott
[SPEAKER_02]: Blakey there, Shanty Baba was there with a
live plant of White Widow and a live plant
[SPEAKER_02]: of White Rhino.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember, you know, respectfully
looking at them, not touching them and
[SPEAKER_02]: squeezing them to smell, but seeing how
close they could get with their touching
[SPEAKER_02]: to try and smell them, it wasn't a lot
coming off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then later I see this frosty bud for
sale in the coffee shop sale, better buy
[SPEAKER_02]: it and try some, and super frosty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, fucking tastes like,
hey, you know, and the buzz was five
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just like, this is, this is
useless.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I started looking at these
frostier ones often under the loop with
[SPEAKER_02]: the measuring scale and they would have
very small heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you started making hash with them,
you'd find you'd get more small heads in
[SPEAKER_02]: some of these like more 45 and 73 or
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And under the scope, they have very long
stocks, like the gland stocks,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you, when you separate it into screens,
you go, damn, I've got more stocks than
[SPEAKER_02]: heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you just, you know, used a single
screen and packed your teeth, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're happy with that kind of B grade
hash, yeah, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the, but the, there's a lot of the
glitters that is not gold, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: often the biggest heads with the tastiest
resin, they're spread out on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got short stocks because all the
energy has gone into the head rather than
[SPEAKER_02]: the stocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when, when you get those long fuzzy
stocks, when you get there with a
[SPEAKER_02]: microscope and look at them, the heads are
really tiny on them, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the buds and the naked eye,
it looks just white.
[SPEAKER_00]: I equivalent that I grew up in a
agriculture environment, mostly like
[SPEAKER_00]: apples, cherries, pears, things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you give that, that fruit,
when you go through and you thin up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a bunch of pears, then the rest
of them have more room to grow bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen that same thing that you're
talking about right there with the resin
[SPEAKER_00]: populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they have more room to grow,
they usually do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Favorites, California orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always liked that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had a really good one, there was an
old one that was absolutely smack orange,
[SPEAKER_02]: like just crazy good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one was really special.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were some of the other ones?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the real Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a bitch for growing because it had
a very bad mildew tolerance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very susceptible to mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was notoriously bad for that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was punchy and it smelled like the
urinal pucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it had that piney smell, like a
urinal puck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could never think of anything else that
it smelled like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh, it's real Romulan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like a urinal puck, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime somebody's brought me Romulan,
like in the last 15 years, nothing like
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it says Romulan, but it's nothing
like it, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen a real one in a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they're out there, but I just
haven't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't go out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for weed, as you might
imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whatever rolls through, rolls through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a lot from friends that share with
me and I try and share some of mine that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've grown to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing it long enough that if I
stopped growing my own right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I could get by on rosin and bud in
my fridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a separate fridge and freezer for
personal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got jars in the racks and jars in
my wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it could probably stay in there
for about 15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like pounds, pounds of rosin or sift,
they're all frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll often just turn the plants right into
ash right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to cure them too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I'll wrap them up and put them
away for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I've smoked in the ones I grew five
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to ask you about that,
you know, coming up and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagined back then you guys weren't
getting as much hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in Canada, yeah, maybe it wasn't
special.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't special.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, we, we did get hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hash was amongst the first things we ever
had.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually it was, uh, usually it was
Lebanese, blonde or red.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a big Lebanese community in our
town.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Lebanese, we had Pakistani,
which they called Afghani, but we all knew
[SPEAKER_02]: was Pakistani.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that had the gold mascara on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that came wrapped in that red plastic
like Gouda cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a wrap hash, hash cutting
and wrapping factory in Holland that all
[SPEAKER_02]: of that hash used to come from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of a, that was,
you know, the bulk of what Canada smoked
[SPEAKER_02]: for a long time was that red wrap gold
seal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started to get occasional brick weed
from Mexico or Jamaica and a lot,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of Jamaican green oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you knew it was Jamaican green oil and
not local green oil because you could
[SPEAKER_02]: really taste the overproof rum they made
it with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I knew that I actually knew
these guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were friends of one of my friends,
older brothers, and they got taken down.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a crazy story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you, cause it's the guy's dead
now and I think it doesn't matter,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the, he, uh, these young guys,
they went to Saunders high school,
[SPEAKER_02]: one that I'm very, they, they were dealing
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they were about to graduate and
they thought we need to scale up our game,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're, we're selling so much dope around
town.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they, they went to Jamaica and they
took a bunch of cash and they took a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of hookers from Miami and they threw a big
party for the boys and put the top two
[SPEAKER_02]: floors of some hotel in Montego Bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had an arrangement then that they
would get, they would have a Jamaican crew
[SPEAKER_02]: that did the bathrooms and the planes that
the plane crews would go in and fill up
[SPEAKER_02]: bags of oil under the sinks and then put
the seal them back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the Jamaican ground crew in
Toronto would unload them and they did it
[SPEAKER_02]: for a few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the way they got caught was this
guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he was out, he was like 21,
22 years old, has a big yacht,
[SPEAKER_02]: having a big party with all these rockers
on it, you know, guys and girls,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's all crank and black Sabbath or
whatever we listened to back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a teenager and these guys were like
22 and they, and they got caught in a
[SPEAKER_02]: fishing net.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a lost fishing net.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got tangled up and they were way,
way out in Lake Huron.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one girl was on acid and she
grabbed the radio.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the guys were diving off the back,
trying to cut off the net, she gets on the
[SPEAKER_02]: radio and then the coast guard and police
and everything show up and they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: is this your dad's yacht?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, no, this is my yacht.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you are, you know, so then they looked
into him and they took the whole thing
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we used to get our Jamaican
green oil back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there is no more spice of life,
when Steve's not around anymore,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you want people to remember when
they think of you?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really hard question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to represent all the work
you put into cannabis to date?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm just getting started at it
still.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope I can put out some much better
work than I ever have yet, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like it's far from done,
but I would love to be remembered as,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, competent breeder, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that, like more than that,
maybe as a decent person, but maybe not.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a tough one, too.
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably one of my favorite anchors
I've ever gotten to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, like I said, that's probably one
of the best, most humble answers that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever heard to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's really cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we get going, I want to ask you
some quick fire questions from everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: that's tuned in, everybody in Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you guys right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of Canadians in here saying,
you know, some of the same things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that hash Jamaican oil in
abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to I'm going to pronounce
this wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mississauga.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the Toronto airport is
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mississauga.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, that was like that was probably
the dominant form of cannabis at one point
[SPEAKER_02]: in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, shout out to Dang Panda,
everybody give Dang Panda some thanks,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, for helping put this together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate the fuck out of you,
my buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stu says, always interesting to me,
East Coast versus West Coast Canada in
[SPEAKER_00]: northern B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash became.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash maybe came to town twice a year and
was twenty dollars a gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in Ontario, we didn't see much grass
until, well, the late 80s, I think was the
[SPEAKER_02]: first time I saw northern lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had been 86, 87, maybe the first time
we saw northern lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was I had some grown in Rockwell
indoors and I'd had some grown in fields
[SPEAKER_02]: outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guys that did fields outside,
three guys did 700 pounds of it by paying
[SPEAKER_02]: a farmer with bean fields to let him put
in small plants late in the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did like 20,000 little plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they paid the bean farmer 10
grand to be out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cops are looking all over the corn
fields and everybody's driving by the bean
[SPEAKER_02]: fields because they're only knee high and
nobody grows beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smartish.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's how people tuck them into
crops to pull it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the bean moves a sweet one because
they'll be looking at all the fields
[SPEAKER_02]: except those because they think they're
too short for weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, now I've given out the
secret and nobody can ever get away with
[SPEAKER_02]: it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because if you if you can be out in
the field with the tractor and trailer,
[SPEAKER_02]: people can drive by.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's going to think anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're working in broad daylight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would just be taking a post hole
diggers and drilling the hole,
[SPEAKER_02]: dumping in the soil mix and following
along with the clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'd be tossing them in late.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they just grow up a nice pogo stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they when they were bringing them to us
to settle, we get like 20 pounds at the
[SPEAKER_02]: top.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't know at first how they were
growing or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, I remember me and a friend,
we split.
[SPEAKER_02]: They fronted us like 20 pounds to flip.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were teenagers.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so we said we better start putting
some into bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all in garbage bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we start pulling out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, man, just look at the size of
this top.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take this little crown of
calyxes off it with no stem or leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I call it the tip top, you know,
because at first we were like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, look at these giant tops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll keep the big tops for us and
we'll just sell the small buds because we
[SPEAKER_02]: were only selling it to get free smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we would.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, first pull out the big buds and
then we realized, damn, 80 percent of it's
[SPEAKER_01]: all these big buds like it's all big buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's very few little buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I started saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm clipping a few tip tops and just
took like a couple of crowns.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had like a half ounce bag that was
just calyxes really.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that made a damaging pan of brownies
for a Hamilton Grateful Dead show that my
[SPEAKER_02]: uncle cop ate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole other story.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I definitely want to
hear, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to get you on the podcast
another time here in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're a busy man, but I want to
thank you again for all the time that you
[SPEAKER_00]: took for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really quick before we get going,
Jesse James 3006 says, which strains of
[SPEAKER_00]: yours give the most couch locked effect in
your experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think of the all of the ones that I've
released was probably the Louis Legends
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimate Indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a real, you know, sit down and
relax kind of joint, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that may need a hash from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember one of my friends called it
the black of black because it was like
[SPEAKER_02]: blacker than black.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, and that was when, when I had a
sizable crop of that, I found it to,
[SPEAKER_02]: I had other things too, but I found it far
preferable for hash over grapefruit,
[SPEAKER_02]: but maybe not as much as Shishkeberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Shishkeberry is a dynamite hash
plant too, but they make a different hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would say couch locked probably
the Louis Ortega Indica by Sweet Tooth
[SPEAKER_00]: EX2P1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stone Stew says starstruck, I can't think
of a question, but can you let him know
[SPEAKER_00]: that grapefruit was the first thing that I
ever smoked in Northern BC that smelled
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet and had a high that didn't make me
non-functional, made me truly fall in love
[SPEAKER_00]: with the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jesse James from Australia wants to
know what's in the cards for the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, to keep doing these satellite
projects I've got going, I've got the
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity to test cannabis in more
environments than I ever thought I would.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I run and just keep at that and develop
based on what I find.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a, I'm not getting bored with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm totally just getting into it and
getting to do it on a level that I never
[SPEAKER_02]: had dreamt of.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, probably even 15 years ago,
I probably never thought, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have the ability to test
stuff in 11 climactic zones in Columbia
[SPEAKER_02]: plus two in Thailand and one in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got three locations in Spain,
you know, that is quite different
[SPEAKER_02]: environment from the Basque country to
Catalonia down to Almeria.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's getting to see all the plants
and all the different environments is
[SPEAKER_02]: really satisfying for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And seeing what I can pull together out of
them is really a joy, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to think now that I'm planting
seed companies and planting cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: research stations, not just seeds,
you know, because I'm training people,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and spending years on training
people to make the selections when I
[SPEAKER_02]: can't, you know, and when I just can't
make it or when I'll never be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: again, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I love to work with the people and I
really want to try and inspire and train
[SPEAKER_02]: as many people as I can and as many places
as I can to just keep pushing the envelope
[SPEAKER_02]: with it and make selections from big
numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know a lot of breeders think that,
you know, high number selections are
[SPEAKER_02]: outdated now that you have molecular
genetics labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the other hand, if you don't have
fields to test them, what good is it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: The real world testing is, you know,
I'm not knocking the labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love having access to the modern labs
that we do, but it's the, being in the
[SPEAKER_02]: blue sky with a green field, there's no
substitute, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm in church when I'm in
those fields selecting what you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm off to next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm down back to the equator and I have
375 lines ready to look through from some
[SPEAKER_02]: of them from quite high numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've really been looking forward to
that for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm stoked, yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I get back from there, I'll be
planning this next trip to go to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as I'm back from Jamaica,
I'll be back to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been to Spain in just over a
year now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people that are there doing a
good job, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not needed for, you know, day to day,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, if things are going good and I'm
getting reports of healthy plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything's on track, that's what I want
to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I can, I'm not micromanaging any
one site, but I'm getting a bird's eye
[SPEAKER_02]: view of all of them and just keeping my
finger on the pulse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Half of it's WhatsApp groups where I've
got WhatsApp groups sending me photos when
[SPEAKER_02]: I wake up in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in the last time zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Thailand is 15 hours ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the European mainland,
then some UK business, then the Colombian
[SPEAKER_02]: time and same as Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's up to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by noon, I've talked to everybody
around the world that's growing weed with
[SPEAKER_02]: me, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: By noon every day I'm done, you know,
because I've started at five in the
[SPEAKER_02]: morning and not every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but lots of days and it's partly
because we're just having fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't necessarily, I don't
necessarily need a picture every day of
[SPEAKER_02]: every plant, but if my friends go,
oh, check this one out, they're really
[SPEAKER_02]: good today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm stoked to see it, you know,
cause it's your hobby.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if it's your hobby, it's not
like waking up and shit, I got to get to
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks, you know, most days it's not
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I wake up, I'm like,
oh sweet, what's happening here?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's happening here?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm stoked to check in on the farms,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, I feel like I'm getting away
with something that I can just stay home
[SPEAKER_02]: ripping dabs in my pajamas and grow weed
all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if I get to show up and take
credit for it once in a while,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's fun too, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to get there in person and try some
and taste some.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no substitute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, there's some of the places
that does require a lot of training,
[SPEAKER_02]: but when I've been able to install people
with experience, over credentials,
[SPEAKER_02]: in those cases, it's a lot easier for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the places where I'm forced by
regulations to hire for credentials over
[SPEAKER_02]: experience, then I've got a little more
effort involved in making sure they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: killing the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've seen some, a lot of really basic
mistakes you'd think, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: certain, you know, growers shouldn't make.
[SPEAKER_02]: One example was, you know, ordering some
Coke or you can get domestic cocoa in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombia.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like you're importing it from Sri
Lanka.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Colombian cocoa, but they're pretty
damn slack about consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they might say on it that it's 0.1 EC
and you get it and it's 1.6 or 1.2 and the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants have toxic shock because the cocoa
hasn't been washed or buffered.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all salty and you're screwed,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've seen that happen as a mistake in
the learning curve for them and I made it
[SPEAKER_02]: very clear, you don't unload cocoa from a
truck until you've done this test where
[SPEAKER_02]: you run water through it and test the EC,
period.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all you got to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a big test.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a handful of cocoa, some water,
and does it change the EC?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't take it off the truck, send it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was back like four months later
and they did it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: That they bought a load of cocoa without
washing, it's not washed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been washed or buffered and the
plants get toxic shock within 48 hours of
[SPEAKER_02]: the transplant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I show up going, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just said, you know what,
no more cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just ruled it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, you can't get any more cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I make them just chop up hemp
stalks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say, we just fill the fields with hemp
and the other, we use Crotalaria as a
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crop as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I say, just chop up the Crotalaria,
chop up the hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: No more hemp, no more cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since we stopped buying cocoa and just
use medium we grow, you know, it's easy to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow fiber at the equation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of fiber plants, but the,
I've been growing even all my backyard
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff the last few years, probably three
years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been growing with all the chopped up
stalks of years before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it only works if you had bigger stalks,
but I had some really huge ones when I
[SPEAKER_02]: started, but I've been able to recycle the
soil and I just chop up all the stalks and
[SPEAKER_02]: put it into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a lazy medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have plants that are really
mildew susceptible, you might get some in
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've seen it affect some that way
because that's totally uncomposted,
[SPEAKER_02]: like just green stalks.
[SPEAKER_02]: But overall it works dynamite.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather just keep using it and not use
the plants that don't like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what kind of nutrients are you feeding
in that sort of medium?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mix up, like I used to make Steve's
special blend as a dry mix or as a wet
[SPEAKER_02]: mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's actually going to be released
again this spring under license by a
[SPEAKER_02]: company in BC here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was, I ate about 17 things in the
dry mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all different meals like alfalfa meal,
corn meal, kelp meal, corn grain meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gluten was the corn meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The green sand, rock phosphate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back then you had more of a range of
guanos and now they're not really allowed
[SPEAKER_02]: to sell guanos.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we used to have Chilean sea bird guano,
fruit bat guano, and then regular bat
[SPEAKER_02]: guano.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would do the bone meal at like three
different grinds to get an extra fine,
[SPEAKER_02]: fine medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: For slower release.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also starting to pelletize that dry
mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can use it as more slow release as
well, or just take it out if you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: a plant somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to just take some pellets out to
throw in the hole for kind of slow
[SPEAKER_02]: release.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what else was in that mix?
[SPEAKER_02]: Feather meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made a vegan mix with no animal
products, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had the regular one had feather
meal and bone meal and blood meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunflower seed hull ash, 0040.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would still use some Epsom salts because
you need the magnesium and the Epsom salts
[SPEAKER_02]: are naturally occurring salts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not like a script super phosphate
or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like making that good dry mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I add my homemade kitchen compost
from all my eggs, all my banana peels and
[SPEAKER_02]: avocados and all the kitchen compost I put
in the backyard, which I also use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a very tiny lawn on the one side of
the pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I cut that and dumped the grass in
there to layer it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's totally just homemade backyard
compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I wasn't using that, I would be
buying worm tastings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even that they're not all created
equal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you find a nice silky black worm
tastings, there's some good brands out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Steve, I know you're getting
tired and we're running out of time here
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to say thank you again for
your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have no idea how much I
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a huge idol of mine to a million
other people that are in here right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really appreciate you for all the
work that you've done and continue to do
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your appreciation is appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everybody in Patreon right now
that came in and shared your questions
[SPEAKER_00]: with Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are lifeblood behind this and
you've you've created this from absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got nothing but love for all of you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until next time, this has been Doc
Callux saying good night.
Good night.
