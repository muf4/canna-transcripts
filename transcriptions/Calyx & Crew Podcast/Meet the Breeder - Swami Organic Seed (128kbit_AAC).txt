[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening everyone, and welcome to the
Calyx and Crew Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your host, Doc Calyx.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we have a very special episode for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have my buddy, Gas, from Swami Organic
Seed on the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to be talking a little bit
about his history in both growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll be touching some spots on Roadkill
Skunk, as well as the nine original plants
[SPEAKER_00]: given to the Brotherhood of Eternal Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be talking a little bit about some
of the most famous cultivars, what he
[SPEAKER_00]: likes working with, what his methodology
behind breeding these different plants
[SPEAKER_00]: together is, and what he's hoping to
achieve, as well as a Q&A from our
[SPEAKER_00]: followers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get started, I want to give a
huge shout out to Stoner Days Apparel.

[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's just jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gas, how you doing today, my brother?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, good, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got all of your chocolate tie inbred
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got 100% germination rate on those and I
got them planted today, so I'm stoked for
[SPEAKER_00]: those to take off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the To The Package Danny chocolate
tie?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you cross that back with the
chocolate tie, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, those are good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw you post about it the other day and
it sounded awesome, but I figured it would
[SPEAKER_00]: be a good dig my toes in before I hit the
actual inbred line.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: The inbred line is the throw line.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just two lines from Snow High and
whoever else had it that gave me it way
[SPEAKER_03]: back when.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just finally got a hold of them and
opened them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Combined them again, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that wasn't the Darwo line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was real brown dirt warrior?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that chocolate tie is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like a bag seed from one of his
buddies in Canada or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for everybody here that doesn't really
know you or hasn't introduced themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: to Swami, why don't you tell us a little
bit about who you are and what you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've been doing this forever,
but I started out probably in my mid-20s
[SPEAKER_03]: as far as breeding plants goes or crossing
types together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back then, we didn't really have a lot to
work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you wanted seed, you had to drive
hundreds of freaking miles or go to
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam or take your chances with
whatever mail order service you could get.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 96, I drove 200 miles to Vancouver and
bought seeds direct from Mark Emery for
[SPEAKER_03]: $200 a pack for a pack of blueberry and
what was it, bubble berry and all that
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We liked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We worked with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody bought it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's amazing how time has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can just get on the internet and
order some seeds with your credit card.
[SPEAKER_03]: The trading scene alone is incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you get into the trading
aspect of it, the greed aspect of it just
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of falls away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we don't even count seed anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just like, oh, here, have some of
these.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have some of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have some of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed that when I planted all those
back crosses, I just automatically figure
[SPEAKER_00]: like 10 to 12 seeds a pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't even know what you threw in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was like 18 altogether.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a method to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you're giving more people more
seeds for the same amount of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing it the right way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's it's about getting people what
they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they want specific things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they select these types for these
specific trade or these combination of
[SPEAKER_03]: trades.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they want those they want those
results, you know, or they want that
[SPEAKER_03]: experimentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to they want something
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're supposed to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about late 80s when you
started breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first started throwing pollen
around, it was probably 88 or 89,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, just whatever we had with,
you know, California, Indica's and
[SPEAKER_03]: Mexicans and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were so young, you know,
you never really see anything through to
[SPEAKER_03]: fruition when you're 18, 19 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that comes with learning patience
with the plan as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, you know, I grew up reading high
times for my parents and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was all my nose is always in the ask
Ed section, you know, what's what's Ed got
[SPEAKER_03]: to say today?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I miss that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even some of the revs, articles and skunk
magazine early on were pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was it was all we had, you know,
if you weren't if you weren't buying the
[SPEAKER_03]: books that were that were out,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or whatever it was, you know, a dollar
seventy five.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could go down to the seven eleven and
buy a copy of high times and and get some
[SPEAKER_03]: weird grow advice, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked a lot about that,
like magazine culture this day and what
[SPEAKER_00]: people, you know, expect to get out of a
certain product that they don't even need.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's the it's the gray area and
cannabis that's always been, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the legality aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it created this subculture of word of
mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so, you know, just the craziest
non biological stuff that ever happened,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, was was somehow accepted as
common practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like everybody threw their soil away at
one point in the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember throwing my soil away because
it's no good anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't tell you how much I appreciate
some of the knowledge that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: instilled on me as far as reusing that
soil and the the results that you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, you know, back in the 90s when
we were doing this and throwing the stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: away, we got tired of trying to hide it in
dumpsters and weird places, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started putting it in our gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all the growers I knew,
that's what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, I was the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we started noticing that our gardens
were like, hey, we're doing good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and then and then people started
picking up the recycled soil thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and and figuring out that it was
it's really just based in mythology,
[SPEAKER_03]: the whole cannabis grill culture,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even aside from breeding, you're saying
that started late 80s, mid 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're also a lifetime cannabis
grower, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually come from generations of
growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, pretty much.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, let me ask you, when you were
getting into this, there wasn't as many
[SPEAKER_00]: people to idolize as there is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you were getting into it,
who did you look up to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who was like, this is the seeds that I
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I need to go after.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, my parents, you know, in 82,
they I remember fondling and playing with
[SPEAKER_03]: real roadkill stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I got cracked when I was 13
years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had two weeks in juvenile hollow because
I took some skunk butt to school.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was no joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one bong hit wrapped up in a
bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: He stuck down in your pocket sitting in
sixth period, blew up the whole freaking
[SPEAKER_03]: room, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and there was nothing like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people say, oh, it smells like
skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, but it it smells like
cannabis, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like good cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's probably the loudest thing I've
ever smelled, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I paid attention to what
was going on in the magazines and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember reading the old seed
catalogs that my parents had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was processing herb by 11 years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we just grew up around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they had all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had high times and all the little the
catalogs and everything laying around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as kids, we read that stuff,
you know, like the fabulous furry freak
[SPEAKER_03]: brothers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember reading those, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were associated with bikers,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they got the stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got the cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got, you know, whatever that those
guys are running up and down the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was that at that time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, just whatever they had.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I just I couldn't tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was before there was a metal halides
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: People just grew with fluorescent bulbs
and they and they had just all these weird
[SPEAKER_03]: designs of fluorescent spectrums that they
thought would do good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people go to this one growth door in
Seattle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the main source for all this
stuff, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that time, you know, fluorescence
were a step ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old incandescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I still vividly remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are these fluorescent tubes growing roads
kill skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was one of my first grows
was actually the very first grow that I
[SPEAKER_00]: ever had was with a chickens heat lamp
thinking that would be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, we shortly moved to
this the T5.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to T5 when those came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, as I grew up, you know,
regionally, wherever you were,
[SPEAKER_03]: you kind of source the best stuff that was
around, you know, to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, whoever is growing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I want to cut of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to I want to grow this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of the time, we never knew what
it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and then sometime around in the
game, people started paying attention to
[SPEAKER_03]: what things really were.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really the biggest, you know,
wave that started changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything was blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm talking like mid 90s now is
when this stuff took off and in the fruity
[SPEAKER_03]: names, the bubbly names started popping
up, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you working with now that you're
excited about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, just everything, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have so many things going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm not really in one magazine
culture methodology of breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we have to do F1, F2, F3 and then
select out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I do that with some type,
but that's not my gig, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's not a there's not a
certain profile that a type has to match.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I kind of do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of put things together based upon
what their similarities are or what their
[SPEAKER_03]: what their their lineages, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the one of the things I like doing
is taking older Afghanis and combining
[SPEAKER_03]: them with their ancestry, you know,
with newer collections, with older
[SPEAKER_03]: collections and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I had a really good question from a
viewer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many plants of apartheid particular
strain do you grow out when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: choosing a new breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, say you want to work with D.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Schwartz for the first time, how many
seeds are you going to pop?
[SPEAKER_03]: As many as possible, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I have 100, I'll crack 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a good way to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a it's critical, but if I only have
five seeds of something, then,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that really narrows your window.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I have five seeds of something and I
don't get any mail, well, that's a dead
[SPEAKER_03]: end line unless I figure something out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I'll do is I'll I'll go through
everything I have and say, OK,
[SPEAKER_03]: what's the best thing I have that's going
to made up with this type that's going to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, enhance its its characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have a personal question for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have thousands of seeds,
you have all the seeds that you need at
[SPEAKER_00]: your disposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many would you consider to be the
minimum amount to be a proper phenome?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, a hundred is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I like a hundred because you're
not going overboard and it's a pretty fat
[SPEAKER_03]: range of expressions in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives you the ability to call out
all the weaker stuff without having to
[SPEAKER_03]: worry, depending on what you're working
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if I if I have two parents of
unrelated genetic origin, say a Thai and
[SPEAKER_03]: an Afghani who've never met each other
before, and I combine them together,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I get my F1s, what my hope is there is
that they have heterosis vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That they express traits and
characteristics that are better than both
[SPEAKER_03]: parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's generally the case with with
working with unrelated genetic material.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why not?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not do that and give those to people
so they can really have some fun?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we love about you,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another really good question from
a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow here, it says, what three to five
strains best represent your work and why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, probably Mazard Giro because I've
worked the line so extensively,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, not taking the two land races,
combine them together and and really
[SPEAKER_03]: selected out the parents over a long
period of time to get the traits and the
[SPEAKER_03]: expressions and everything that I wanted
out of the line without boxing it in,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, because you're you'll still get
some I like to keep the lines open a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit so that people that don't like
a lot of Indica can select a little more
[SPEAKER_03]: sativa if they want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's it's reality, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I personally like the heavy
Indica Mazard 776 Giro myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some people, man, just really just
they're on the couch and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: slobbering, they're passed out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get up and they go raid the fridge
and they go back to the couch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's it's really nonproductive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what what type of strains do you
prefer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you prefer the more productive stuff or
is it a good mix of both throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: day?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I use it, you know, as a human
being.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll do the sativas in the morning and
the Indicas at night.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, have you ever noticed people
that react to those things differently?
[SPEAKER_03]: Generally, depending on what you give
them, you know, like if I smoke a haze
[SPEAKER_03]: dominant type with somebody who's not used
to smoking like sativas, dude,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, at like eight o'clock in the
morning here, have a cup of coffee and hit
[SPEAKER_03]: a haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: There'll be a loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Missy has a couple of friends that I've
given some really, really heavy hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We even smoked the mousse and lobster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor P, which has the Cali mist in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we gave that to her friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was down.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said she was tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was like, wow, really?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's interesting, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of women really like the Cali mist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was that was really successful with
the women.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just wondering if it's not one of
those things where they use like
[SPEAKER_00]: methylphenidate for ADHD kids and it
actually has the opposite effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's so much going on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the most incredible thing about it
all is every single one of these types and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything that I do has a different
effect or a different result.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can really narrow down what people
want in their methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, so a lot of my customers,
they're like, tell me what I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you find a lot of people coming to you
asking you, um, what do you have that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be good for my ailment?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's been consistent over the,
the, the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you actually have a type that is good
for PTSD, correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That Nigerian sunshine is another one of
those top three lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to dig into that so bad that I've
worked extensively and then isolated a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of phenotypes, you know,
but I like to keep that one open too,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I don't really, I don't want to
lose that 76 Nigerian expression in there,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome that you do that in,
especially in a day and age where a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people are cubing their stuff or they're
bottlenecking it in one form or another,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and I do that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I have my back crosses and my
cubes and for the people that are going up
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's, it's, it's uniformity,
you know, they want the uniformity.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, it's easy to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell us a little bit about this blue
orca that I see you crossing with
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the sister of the one, you know,
um, there were, there were nine cuts in
[SPEAKER_03]: 1983 that were distributed to nine
brotherhood of eternal love members and
[SPEAKER_03]: they all had names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the, the one was the one because it
had the narrowest leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the one that looked like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was tie dominant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they named these and they gave them
to those nine members.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue orca was coots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, there was Mary Poppins was another
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: A Nazi's cut was another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, crystal flowers was another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard that name, but most of these
are lost nowadays.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's seven lost sisters that
nobody knows where they were or what,
[SPEAKER_03]: or I mean what happened to them or where
they are, you know, they're probably
[SPEAKER_03]: extinct or they're, or they're types
nowadays that people just don't even know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for example, you know, when I grew out
the, I forget which chem it was Chem D or
[SPEAKER_03]: something, uh, some years ago,
the first thing I noticed was how much it
[SPEAKER_03]: resembled the one in blue orca.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there really wasn't anything out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That matches those profiles like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you've had the, the aft
gooey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a while, but from gooey breeder,
it's kind of like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: an Afghan and a tie dominant kind of thing
is just greasy as sweet as hell.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jinx was doing some work with that aft
gooey.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, you know, it was just kind of
loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell us a little bit about the story
behind the blue orca going to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that what?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not the blue orca.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that was the roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that was the one that was hit
with the European.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy, he, you know, took a bag from
Humboldt, which was the roadkill skunk and
[SPEAKER_03]: 85 to Mexico, to his sister who lived
there and they're heady as hell,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So she gives it to her favorite local
farmer who happens to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the export business and grows a
European type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was just the drug cultivar over
in that area, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they're supposed to be pretty
good from what I hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never smoked a period.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a pan.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wouldn't know them.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mexican farmer hybridized it into that
type for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a 30 year roadkill skunk Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, you don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we only got a few seeds in and we
split them between two guys and he got the
[SPEAKER_03]: females and I got the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I sent the pollen and it didn't hook
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was it a sterile male or was it the
female?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, just however the pollen got
there, maybe it got too hot during transit
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just didn't work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you do offer other arcades.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I took the males and the first thing
I thought was, oh, I got to save this
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: So naturally it was the one blue orca and
cherry bomb since they were the oldest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of those three crosses,
which one became your favorite?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I like the blue orca by the 85
Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it about that blue orca that just
does it for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's uniform, you know, like when all the
offspring are uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so it's just a very true breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it breeds truer than the one the
one did.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's F ones are always they're kind of all
over the plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you said it was more tie in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, unless you made it with something
that it likes and it'll go down that line,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But mostly it's a blue orca has has the
stability and the uniformity that that you
[SPEAKER_03]: need as a grower, you know, and the early
finish time and for a finish time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that looking like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue orca itself is 56 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fifty six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's always a fun harvest when
they come off as like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I work with it so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and a lot of these landrys
Afghanis, they go seventy five,
[SPEAKER_03]: eighty, eighty five, ninety days,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that you're typically
breeding the blue orca with is the longer
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering cultivars and trying to knock
them down and keep that hetero.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is bigger and early flowering times
and high resin, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take a short break.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be right back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we take a short break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make a quick shout out to
Coconaut sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can find them on IG at Coconaut
Inc.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's K.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: K.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: N.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: U.T.
[SPEAKER_00]: I.N.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can find them over at www.coconaut
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use code calex at checkout.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's C-A-L-Y-X all caps for 10 percent
off your order.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy a sensor from Coconaut,
not only are you supporting a small
[SPEAKER_00]: business, but you're buying a sensor
that's competitive with all the top
[SPEAKER_00]: leading sensors on the market right now
without the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: It monitors my temperature, my humidity,
my VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I heard from Anton coming up here
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is actually going to be able to monitor
CO2 levels as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're talking a fraction of the cost
of the leading brands right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original Mitsu, the original Coconaut
sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sensor is retailing for 69 dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick yourself up, maybe one or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out and tell me that I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I absolutely love the one that's in
mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can check it anytime on the app on my
phone, see where my conditions are,
[SPEAKER_00]: if anything's out of whack and if anything
needs to be adjusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm not sitting there worrying
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what's going on in my tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what's going on in my environment
in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have to worry as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge shout out to Coconaut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge shout out to Anton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get yourself one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's jump back into the episode with
Gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is up, Calyx and crew podcast
listeners?
[SPEAKER_00]: Before the break, we were talking to Gas
over at Swami Organic Seed and we were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about some of his practices and
some of his favorite cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I wanted to get more into those
Brotherhood of Eternal Love, some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanis that were originally passed
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what made the Afghanis so special at
that time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gas, can you give us some insight about
what it was over in the area that just
[SPEAKER_00]: made some of those different types so
desirable at that time?
[SPEAKER_03]: All unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what's really special about
them, you know, because, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess before the Soviet invasion and all
that, each family or tribe had their own
[SPEAKER_03]: type of hatch.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they cultivated their own type of herb,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like a Balkan Afghanistan is,
some people might consider it a Mazar
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghanistan because it's in the same
little area as Mazar.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's really quite different than the
Mazar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mazar Afghanistan, you know, even though
you could, it's like just a click down the
[SPEAKER_03]: road.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, it's quality is far superior.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hash is like food grade.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so like just creamy and nice and just
every Afghan has its own character.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that amazing?
[SPEAKER_00]: These little micro climates can influence
the plan so many different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just depends on what those farmers
were doing too, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: What were they doing with their,
with their herb?
[SPEAKER_03]: Were they taking it to market?
[SPEAKER_03]: Were they exporting it?
[SPEAKER_03]: What were they doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: What was their objective?
[SPEAKER_03]: How educated were they in farming and in
everything, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you're a shitty ass farmer,
you're, you know, you're probably not
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be very successful in market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where the herb speaks for itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like when I went through these,
uh, Jhalabad, you know, I went through
[SPEAKER_03]: like 200 at once and I saw so many
different things and these were fresh out
[SPEAKER_03]: of the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the next Passover from Khyber
Pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, is that where it is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, some really cool stuff,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was one of the coolest things
I've ever done and ever seen was opening
[SPEAKER_03]: up those 200, um, Jhalabad, you know,
out of all the land races and everything,
[SPEAKER_03]: that was just so cool to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing a, a Jhalabad cross by farmer
fly right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I've seen from
that is a lot of vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see these gigantic fat fingers
leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were so many expressions.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were index Indica expressions.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were sativa expressions.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were both.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are ones that were just tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are ones that were super short.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were loaded with resin or ones that
smelled like skunk, body odor,
[SPEAKER_03]: gas, fuel, um, ones that just smelled like
shit, you know, and you know, such a
[SPEAKER_03]: range, such a plethora of, of,
uh, untouched stuff, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing that I've noticed with
these is they are very, very stinky and
[SPEAKER_00]: they have a lot of vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really put my nose on it yet
because it's the first time going through
[SPEAKER_00]: veg, but, uh, definitely very,
very smelly fat fingered plants on the end
[SPEAKER_00]: that I got.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're definitely, um, Hindu related.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some, some definite Hindu,
uh, Hindu ask features in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what, what else are you working with
that just really gets your goat?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I love this, uh, you know,
five haze stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who doesn't, you know, it's, it's,
you know, it's one of the best hybrids of
[SPEAKER_03]: all time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everything, everything you do with it
is just incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that work is really interesting to me
is to, is to go through these NL ones,
[SPEAKER_03]: NL two, NL five and hazes and stuff and
experiment kind of continue on like with
[SPEAKER_03]: what Neville was doing and those guys were
doing with those combination, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, like, you know, one by a chocolate
tie kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you done that one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, everything is put together
for a specific reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, this isn't just random throwing
pollen around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've been doing it so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been at it so long and you're
working a lot of the same type.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I can identify traits and plants
really easy, you know, and identify origin
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty easy too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after you've worked with everything for
so freaking long, man, you just,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've talked about that before
too, as far as like Neville having the eye
[SPEAKER_00]: for a thing and you kind of have that eye
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have the eye, man,
you're not going to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you can't select,
you know, Easter eggs correctly,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's, I don't know, you know, I'm with
you, but you know, a lot of the things I
[SPEAKER_03]: do, everything has intention.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like the Wahak and IBL by the chocolate
tie, for example, I don't want to combine
[SPEAKER_03]: that with the velvet rush.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted, I want to make a mock
blueberries just because, because I
[SPEAKER_03]: freaking can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: That velvet rush that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically like your version of the
old juicy fruit,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was long.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was how many years before blueberry
became a thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think he did the cross in 79,
but TJ has always been, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: not really forthcoming with his
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't really know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if he said it, I never fucking heard
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's the Highland blue tie was only
imported for 15 months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what makes this particular one
unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by 1976, 77, the Scouts that had went
and got it, they knew what they were
[SPEAKER_03]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they're heavy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have some blue.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why the blue line from the
Highland, but that's the that's the blue
[SPEAKER_03]: line and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why any any blue cross that has
that Highland blue tie in it is always
[SPEAKER_03]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is that's wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's intriguing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're telling me that the blue tie was
what expressed a lot of those blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors that that's why where it got its
name from.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why, man, it's the basis of
everything blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought between the red tie,
the blue tie, green tie was just
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with the the bud color on it
and maybe where it came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, they were different regions,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, different tribes, people did different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but it wasn't just the blue coloration,
it was actually the flavor as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was the characteristics of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it just all made sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically just those two.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think the first line was juicy
fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eighty one, eighty two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say early eighties.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in eighty six at a Brotherhood of
Eternal Love Barbecue, Mel Frank gave us
[SPEAKER_03]: the velvet rush back to two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, the other half of it anyway,
they told him and said, hey, these are
[SPEAKER_03]: velvet rot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he took them and he gave them to his
associates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who took them to the hills of San Clemente
and did open pollinations with big crops
[SPEAKER_03]: for like five or six years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the plants were, you know,
they're they're like 20 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said they exhibited every color in
the rainbow.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had flour from the top to the bottom
when they took it to market, which was,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, L.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: and Orange County.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, you know, it's always the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: You always hear the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the best around, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the story behind that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where when back in 1990 or
yeah, when Cooke got the seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: back from them in 1990, he did a breeding,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: He crossed him to his eighty eight and all
five eight, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the one I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he had all those packs, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somehow that guy was hooked up and he had
everything, you know, somehow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can't even remember, but I saw,
you know, eighty eight G has I had that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think I gave it to somebody,
you know, because I had so much stuff that
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just all of a sudden had this
responsibility for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you've had that G 13 for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know your wife showed me some pictures
of the early grows in, I want to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Barney and a reefer man's
airborne G 13 by original.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, all right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was good, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody liked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as soon as I did Blue Orca,
hey, that shit was out the window,
[SPEAKER_03]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, everybody that I've seen
grown that is really, really appreciated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's it's it's for real.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it reminds me of Kelly missed
his team compared to Blue Orca Hayes,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they have that that uplifting kind of
everything's cool feeling, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So similar effects, but much more poke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, God, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not as is a debilitating as in
all five days itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is, you know, if you know anything
about in all five days, you know that the
[SPEAKER_03]: real shit will put you in a fucking fetal
position.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've definitely been there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not it's not a pleasurable thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we'll just go wide on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, if you enjoy that kind of
experience and generally younger guys
[SPEAKER_03]: enjoy enjoy that shit, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at this age, man, I don't dig that
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep my head straight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like Blue Orca Hayes is the cleaned up
version of 88 in all five days.
[SPEAKER_03]: He could still function and, you know,
be a psychonaut at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, get your shit done and enjoy
your high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely going to have to grow that
one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my followers asks, what is your
favorite get things done smoke since we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about your hazes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it that Blue Orca Hayes?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That worked for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the Nigerian by the Punto Rojo for
getting stuff done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nigerian Sunshine by Punto Rojo.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get to grow out any of the pure
Punto Rojo?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, the hybrids are better,
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not that's just not a type that a
lot of people get a hold of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to crack some Punto Rojo this
spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do CBG, you know,
Kenobiogen, Punto Rojo, and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: do the I think the Escobar Punto Rojo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do them all at once,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you already have something set in
mind to put that with?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I just kind of I have projections
for what I'm going to do every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to work the Mexicans this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to work the Thais this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: No teasers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year was the Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I opened up all the Afghanis and did a
bunch of Afghani work, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now now this year I need to repopulate
some things like, you know, the Panama,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Guerrero and some stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, just to freshen up the seed,
you know, once they get past four years
[SPEAKER_03]: old, I start I start getting nervous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because their viability goes down,
you know, right around five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize that was the start of
degradation.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're if you're well, I have them in
storage, too, you know, so they're
[SPEAKER_03]: protected.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also have some that I bring out and
I work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the jars are open.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in a space, you know, they're
sitting there because I'm packing speed
[SPEAKER_03]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you feel about people that are
refrigerating and freezing their seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you should really insulate the
containers that you put your seed in or
[SPEAKER_03]: it'll damage the enzyme.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, good tip right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't use rice and any of that dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just really, just really insulate the
container well, you know, put some cotton
[SPEAKER_03]: in there and then wrap it in a sock and
then wrap it in some tape or something
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to store your seeds in a
regular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it give it some buffer so it's not
direct cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're going to lose power.
[SPEAKER_03]: And weird things like that are going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's big temperature
fluctuations between cold and heat and
[SPEAKER_03]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really takes a toll on the enzyme in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just between freezing and room temp,
you're going to have some breakdown.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that can only happen so many times
before it just it just like screw you,
[SPEAKER_03]: buddy, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a hundred dollar temp right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had we had one smartass follower ask,
Will you be worth it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so out of the loop on any of that
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even keep up, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just it's just absurd to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did everybody start naming their
stuff after candy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's more they the taste that they
want to market.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to market it like candy because
that's the target group that they're
[SPEAKER_03]: hitting, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's just candy anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you when you guys are saying stuff
like, oh, this smells like rotten,
[SPEAKER_00]: dirty gym locker socks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what gets me off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll give something a name if the if
the if the genetic breeding is just way
[SPEAKER_03]: too long to say, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Matanuska, Thunderfuck by Shipper
again after any by Alaskan Thunderfuck by
[SPEAKER_03]: 88 NL five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even at that point, you're just
abbreviating pretty much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so why not just go, OK, Thunderfuck
is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're not calling it exotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheetah dumb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Banana cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Banana cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have planned for the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything that you've always
wanted to get your hands on that you
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't been able to touch?
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, no, man, I really have just
everything and.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I have a lot of IBLs and land
races, you know, so I basically have
[SPEAKER_03]: everything that I ever need to work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like, oh, I wouldn't mind getting
a hold of the puna bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we talked about that one man that
that one's a hard one to find.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen cuts around, man, but they don't
look like the cuts that I've seen that I
[SPEAKER_03]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look kind of wispy compared to the
chunky ones I've seen the puna bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was basically just the old Pona.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rumored to have lineage to Captain
Cook.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember my dad having a shoe box or
telling me the story about him having a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend that came over with a shoe box and
opened it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was just a big fricking cola the
size your arm in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the early 80s and mid 80s,
that was that we were kids in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_03]: Northwest.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were getting some Hawaiian stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one of them was Buddha,
but it was just it was just incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, wow, where did this come
from?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what was it about the Hawaiians
that just stuck out to you right away?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's probably just the soil that the
types were grown in, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: rich, rich, nice, good, tropical kind of
environment, you know, so and only the
[SPEAKER_03]: types that could make it made it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything that got mold or was weak,
it just kind of faded away, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there were different
microclimates to the islands.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, some heads took them to
other islands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some heads took them on the other side of
the island where they developed sativa
[SPEAKER_03]: traits, where they developed indica traits
like the Molokai type Molokai.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really the most indica dominant
Hawaiian type that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and you think why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would they select this indica dominant
type down there and whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was going to say that was one of
the few that I experienced where the buds
[SPEAKER_00]: on it weren't as beautiful as some of the
other Hawaiian type.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they were ugly as hell, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought it was a leopard colony.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they were probably selecting for
high CBD if their if their relatives had
[SPEAKER_03]: anything to do with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's what people tend to do
where they work with plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll select for what they need,
you know, for what feels good to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's one that still hangs around
to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go over to the islands and you ask
for Molokai frost, they'll have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the Mazar PCK by the Mazar I put
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those two, you know,
was tested on old people and people with
[SPEAKER_03]: pain problems and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was just basically put together for
them and as a solid indica base to do
[SPEAKER_03]: sativa out-crosses with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you done any work with very many
Africans?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of your favorite Africans?
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite one is the transki.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty neat, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about it was different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the effect?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the effect is nice and similar
structure to most of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's like any other kind of wild
sativa, you know, but it was loaded with
[SPEAKER_03]: frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those African sativas actually,
I don't know if this is just my experience
[SPEAKER_00]: or this is how it is, but they seem to be
shorter sativas compared to some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just depends on, you know, where they
were and what everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Swaziland, those were short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's mostly what I've worked with is
more of that coastal region off the Cape
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Congo, you know, that was out of
control like a vine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Long, super long over a hundred day
flowering time and all that, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Durban's are they're pretty nice,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those were also more inland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, they have that thing where
you just can't really smoke a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just get wigged out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially women and people that aren't
used to smoking sativas, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would you say would be a good
intro sativa that you have produced for
[SPEAKER_00]: people like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's what you're working with right
now, like a Pakistani influx into a
[SPEAKER_03]: chocolate tie, you know, something that's
not predominantly indica, but it has
[SPEAKER_03]: enough indica in it to keep them kind of
grounded in case they aren't used to the
[SPEAKER_03]: effect or something, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, even all day smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, it just depends as you
explore this stuff and explore region and
[SPEAKER_03]: you explore hybridization, you start
coming to note certain thing about effect,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like Nigerian has a lot of CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so does the Punto Rojo.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like, duh, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it worked, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any types that you work with
where you're actually selecting towards
[SPEAKER_00]: that CBD side?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, a lot, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I did a lot of hash plant work
this last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was basically putting hash plants
together, you know, for resin production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what were some of your favorite hash
plants that you found?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you know, the blue orca by the black
candahar, you know, and I put that to the.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chem dog or the one by the Turkish gummy
or I didn't know that you're working with
[SPEAKER_03]: that Turkish gummy, the one by the NL two
is another another one, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: where the resin is just going to be off
the hook, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did the Turkish cross take away from that
slender conical shape?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are fresh ones, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Raided myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the ones that I want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to get into the one by the NL two
myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because of the similarities between
the two and the potential, the potential
[SPEAKER_03]: for the effect and the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I was talking to the hash earlier
about that NL two or it might have been
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was put it was put together in Canada
over 30 years by some Canadians who have
[SPEAKER_03]: had the advantage of a lot of space so
they could do a lot of numbers and they
[SPEAKER_03]: selected it out really.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everything that I've used with that NL
two comes out in L2 dominant, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: which isn't surprising.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah, just most of the stuff I do is
hybridized for a certain outcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can put these plants up next to
whatever and they're going to outcompete
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your top criteria in a smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like are you the smell, the taste,
the high itself, bag appeal?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's most important to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're going more for
effect over anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does taste or smell have any play into it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It does a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's one of the first things
that you can select for is scent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that gives you an idea, you know,
what what the taste is going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it doesn't work that way all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can't rely on that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but I do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll select for a certain characteristic
dominant in that type.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But over everything else, effect is number
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that's probably the most important
thing or preserving the genotype,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about the taste and smell
portion of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking for something that
correlates like the taste relates to the
[SPEAKER_00]: smell or does it not matter that much?
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as it's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's so it's such a plethora,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's so many things that it's
an endless rainbow.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I want to make banana, I can make
banana.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I want to make orange, I can make
orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I want to make lemon and it goes on and
on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying it depends on what your
goals are and what you find within while
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing that, you know, just what
hits your fancy, what ticks all these
[SPEAKER_00]: boxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the same thing with making pretty pot,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the nice fluorescent purple kind
of stuff that everybody likes to look at,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that takes really cool pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and that's really easy to do,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've always said that some of
the best stuff I've ever smoked to look
[SPEAKER_00]: like hell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Generally, you know, it's it's going to be
the Landry sativas that are going to rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your dome the most, you know, it's not to
say that a pure Afghani hash plant isn't
[SPEAKER_03]: going to rock your dome just the same,
but in a different region of the brain,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking for that up clearheaded
fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get shit done.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on who you are and what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, everything's humans are so
unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it's so critical for me to
offer such a you know, so many choices
[SPEAKER_03]: because everybody wants something
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody wanted something that everybody
wanted to run.
[SPEAKER_03]: Suck, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I thank you for coming on,
brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've given out some really, really good
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can people find you?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can send me an email at Swami Gear,
Swami dot Gear Gmail, or you can get
[SPEAKER_03]: online.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find us on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: My better half, Miss Green Dreams.
[SPEAKER_03]: She runs all that, all the social media
and networking and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a hands on guy, you know.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate you coming on, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I look forward to having you
on another podcast where we were going to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about some of your methods with
living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be that'd be a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be awesome, especially for
people like me that are already practicing
[SPEAKER_00]: KNF.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of working towards that no-till
style.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll save you a lot of headaches and a lot
of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't tell you how much I appreciate
some of that knowledge that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: instilled on me, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, well, it wasn't just me,
you know, there was there was Tude and
[SPEAKER_03]: there was Tim Welton and we had quite a
group for quite a while that explored all
[SPEAKER_03]: these avenues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't really push the envelope to take
everything into the next hemisphere,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you were one of the few people that I
personally got to interact with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate you for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything just naturally worked out how
it should, I guess, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're doing the good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a day and age where there is a lot
of filters that shouldn't be there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're putting forth information that's
correct, true, honest and is tested with
[SPEAKER_00]: time, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll benefit the entire planet if
everybody gets on board, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Regenerative farming practices and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you don't really have to go
buy anything in a damn hydra store.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to buy a damn thing to grow
her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't that an amazing episode?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a huge shout out to Gas for
joining us for the very first episode of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Calyx and Crew podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an amazing episode packed full of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gas is always a great guy to talk to and
I'm looking forward to doing another
[SPEAKER_00]: episode with him where we were going to
talk about living organic soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I am personally stoked for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get going, I want to give one
more shout out to Diamond Cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best trimming scissors on the market,
hands down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can use Doc-10% at checkout to
get 10% off scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like a piece of jewelry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as you keep them clean,
they have a sharp edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been using these same models of
scissors over multiple runs, greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor, indoor, and they've stood the
test of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't use anything else and I have no
want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to give a shout out to my
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without them, there would be no me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to give a shout out to my
other half, Mrs. Calyx.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without her, there would be no Doc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I want to give a shout out
to my crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Busky Gardens, Country Green Thumb,
Grow Green Daddy, Farmer Fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll all be joining me over there in
Discord to help guide you and the
[SPEAKER_00]: community of growers that wants to see you
