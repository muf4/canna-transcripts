[SPEAKER_00]: All right today guys, we've got an awesome
interview for you We've got none other
[SPEAKER_00]: than the man himself dragon swing genetics
in here He's going to be talking about his
[SPEAKER_00]: new lines that he's coming out with some
of the past stuff that he's done We're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna have a smoke session as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's introduce him without further
ado.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up dragon slam?
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey pretty good man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me So, let's talk you
said you were working with smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: canopies now you made the big move from
Hawaii to Oregon So you're a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: closer to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in the Pacific Northwest now
Obviously the climate's got to be a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: better to deal with especially when you're
doing indoor Oregon can be tricky still
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon can still be tricky Yeah,
especially where we're at We kind of went
[SPEAKER_01]: back to where we were before we moved to
Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're back in the Willamette Valley
which does have a you know, fairly It's
[SPEAKER_01]: nicer than Hawaii's growing season,
but it's still I mean, it's certainly not
[SPEAKER_01]: the Emerald Triangle We still get you know
some months or some years I should say the
[SPEAKER_01]: season will be you know October 1st and
that's all you get and some years,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know you get lucky and Usually a lot
of rain and a lot of fog and a lot of gray
[SPEAKER_01]: days Whereas Hawaii was the endless
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all you get is the humidity So it's
definitely we're we're kind of just in a
[SPEAKER_01]: rental right now But we'll be getting a
farm again at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the meantime, we're we're just
doing some indoor You know kind of micro I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess you could say we've got two five by
five flower tents and a two by four flower
[SPEAKER_01]: tent so it's Considerably smaller than
what I would usually be running but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: just the sacrifice we had to do to move
Yeah, yeah you got to sacrifice some
[SPEAKER_00]: things just to keep growing the plant
sometimes life changes and the plant just
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps going yeah What are you working on
in those rooms man?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's new with Dragon Slave genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's to come?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the big project that I'm focusing in on
for probably the next year or two Is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be my Macberry moonshine line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one tent that I just Reversed the
modified Macberry moonshine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the GMO to the Macberry
moonshine was that original Cross and so I
[SPEAKER_01]: have a keeper out of that that was found
by can essentials here in Oregon there are
[SPEAKER_01]: And on their first run it was at like four
point six percent turps and like 26
[SPEAKER_01]: percent THC and then in their second run
it went over six percent turps and almost
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 percent THC garlic skunk notes Crushes
here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They they were in greenhouse like light
supplementation Greenhouses all dialed in
[SPEAKER_01]: but still, you know still an organ
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still have the humidity And it's a cut
that's been proven out for them and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: it's everywhere right now in Oregon pretty
much They're hitting every dispensary here
[SPEAKER_01]: and people are loving it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one This reversal didn't make as
much pollen as I was hoping I will make
[SPEAKER_01]: some seed but I am going to have to
reverse it again To really make the
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial size to be able to release
anyone So that'll that'll happen again and
[SPEAKER_01]: then the next my next reversal which that
cycle is very Vegging right now is the
[SPEAKER_01]: blackberry moonshine bx1 reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna make s1 and I'm also gonna
make a Feminized version of the Halley
[SPEAKER_01]: moonshine line as I call it, which is the
blackberry moonshine to the modified
[SPEAKER_01]: Macberry moonshine So it has a Macberry on
both sides just you know different moms,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the same dad on both crosses so it
should be more consistent than Like a
[SPEAKER_01]: normal f1, you know have more of the same
traits from having the same lineages But
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll still it should still have that that
bigger that we all you know that we all
[SPEAKER_01]: want Those are the yeah, those are the big
ones for the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that Haley looked really good and
I'm definitely expecting to to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate off that that last one that
you were talking about The Macberry
[SPEAKER_01]: moonshine that sounds delicious Yeah,
it is it generally comes out with like a
[SPEAKER_01]: tangerine candy or like a tangerine kind
of Sweet funk kind of going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's generally have a Macberry moonshine
that itself is And then the blackberry
[SPEAKER_01]: moonshine bx1 has more of the fuel sour
Raunch kind of to it and then the modified
[SPEAKER_01]: has that garlic From the GMO and like some
skunky, you know sour notes It doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have like the Thai food side of the GMO
which you know, some people love GMO Some
[SPEAKER_01]: people hate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may get great crosses and get people
love it for concentrates But you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: not everyone loves a turp Yeah,
absolutely speaking of nasty stuff I've
[SPEAKER_00]: got to bring it up because there's so many
of my followers that have been growing it
[SPEAKER_00]: we've talked about it Before and how much
I love it the garlic stash man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any new plans working with the
garlic stash?
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be this year, but I do what I
want to do with that Line is I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: find a male out of that garlic stash and I
want to hit it to the modified Macberry
[SPEAKER_01]: that That's my short-term plan and at the
same time I probably will when I hunt
[SPEAKER_01]: through the line looking for the mail I'll
probably look through females as well and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know see See if I could find a good
breeder mom that I could keep to you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe reverse some day, but I Love the
garlic turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find them so Anti-stress, you know,
that's the big thing with the I find with
[SPEAKER_01]: the garlic is it's really good Powerful
smoke that you can function and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: get through your day and you know There's
a lot of crazy shit going on in the world
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot to get stressed out about
and it's just one that it just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: helps melt that away So I definitely you
know, I'm gonna be putting more garlic
[SPEAKER_01]: into more of my lines, especially for the
next year that that's a good news man
[SPEAKER_00]: because Back when you first made that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you familiar with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, calyx at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had him on the show before I'm
somewhat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I don't know if I've met him
Personally, but I you know through social
[SPEAKER_00]: media and such He grew that garlic stash
for quite a while And the concentrate off
[SPEAKER_00]: that was so freakin beautiful man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Quite a few cultivars out there
nowadays that have or they claim to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: garlic turp But I have not come across
anything quite like the garlic stash where
[SPEAKER_00]: it was like that even GMO Where was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Overwhelming fucking garlicky onion II
nastiness and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, I'm a big fan and I think like
the GMO I like it by itself, but I
[SPEAKER_01]: actually prefer it in crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to get away from kind of that That
that cookie side of it and get more into
[SPEAKER_01]: just the straight sour the straight raunch
Because with the GMO you still have that
[SPEAKER_01]: underbite of like that Thai food and kind
of cookie ask Note to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one that is especially depending on
how far in the flower you take it GMO can
[SPEAKER_01]: be a pretty you know GMO in eight weeks
and GMO at 13 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wouldn't even believe it's the same
damn plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean it could be pretty different
Where do you like to take it down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's your harvest frame on the GMO?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much as a blanket statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say I take everything way further
than most people do I smoke pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: from the time I get up to the time I go to
bed I have a fucked up tolerance So,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I'm I'm an all-day Heavy smoker and
so the the early harvest just doesn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: enough potency for me I like to I like to
I like it really ripe generally like I
[SPEAKER_01]: hear people say eight weeks and ten weeks
and I'm like I'm not really even looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at chopping at eight weeks unless I'm
outdoor and though, you know, the weather
[SPEAKER_01]: is forcing me to but Indoors I don't pull
anything usually under 10 or 11 if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: something for me to smoke and usually more
like 12 13 is usually where I take things
[SPEAKER_01]: to You really get the full turf profile
and the full potency that you're gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the line going deep That takes a
lot of patience going that long man
[SPEAKER_00]: Congrats on that one Are you seeing any
different in the out crossings that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: making with like the Macberry moonshine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that harvest time a little bit sooner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it about the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my selections have been done in
tough climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So generally just by that fact,
I'm usually taking the faster phenos
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just you know, that's part of how I
have to select when I've been in tough
[SPEAKER_01]: climate So generally the longer I work
something the faster it's gonna flower
[SPEAKER_01]: just based on how I select plants And
especially in Hawaii because the days are
[SPEAKER_01]: so consistent and because it's tropical
and so close to the equator Especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaii things just flower so much faster
That's for sure You had a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges growing over there in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: You told me about that Last time would you
like to tell our followers a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about what makes growing in Hawaii so
fucking hard?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean if you take just a simple
fact that it's 3,000 miles away from a
[SPEAKER_01]: landmass and everything is shipped in So
across the board everything is three times
[SPEAKER_01]: more expensive You know like a bag of soil
here on the mainland, you know 15 bucks
[SPEAKER_01]: for a bag of Fox farms on in Hawaii is $35
to $50 If they even have it and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual climate itself fights you at every
step of the way I got our spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were at 900 foot elevation We were
about six miles away as the crow flies to
[SPEAKER_01]: the ocean and that our spot 300 to 500
inches of rain a year is pretty average
[SPEAKER_01]: and normal for that climate zone Daily the
humidity would usually be No lower than
[SPEAKER_01]: 80% most days would be Closer to 90% in
the daytime And then at night 99% humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: every single night.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's nothing no snow Nothing ever
resets your pest pressures and your fungus
[SPEAKER_01]: pressures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything can breed year-round fungus
you know from mites to I mean every every
[SPEAKER_01]: pest basically can grow unchecked and also
because it's so isolated most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that we would consider to be
beneficial that would Somewhat put a
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure back onto the pest doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a it's a real recipe for a petri
dish effect where you know, you're in the
[SPEAKER_01]: jungle and Every single if it if it lives
in the jungle is going to be in your
[SPEAKER_01]: garden then there's no preventing it you
can Deal with it as best you can But I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean I would find I'd have to run You know
300 seeds Hawaii itself would kill the
[SPEAKER_01]: first Fuck 200 phenos just from mold from
septoria from stem rot you know within
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of in that kind of zone and it's
It's really tough really tough to grow and
[SPEAKER_01]: then on top of that even if you You know
the stars align you have you you're on
[SPEAKER_01]: your game You know you get stuff to the
finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're in a zone that the humidity
is never less than 85% 85% so then you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how do you dry and cure flower
off-grid?
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's 85% humidity and there's no easy
answer to that except for you know
[SPEAKER_01]: boatloads of infrastructure and money in
order to overcome the climate and then
[SPEAKER_01]: like even let's say you're with your
buddies and you got some fire and you roll
[SPEAKER_01]: a joint and You roll too slow or someone
starts talking, you know, and then you got
[SPEAKER_01]: a light it Well, it's picked up all the
humidity and now it's not gonna you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be able to smoke it because it's too
damn wet So, I mean it as a grower and as
[SPEAKER_01]: a smoker it's a it's a really goddamn
challenging place Yeah, that's I mean a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people don't even consider things
like that with that kind of humidity It's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be hard to spray anything keep
anything, you know Pest resistant at all
[SPEAKER_00]: or you know kill off the bugs that you
already have.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty fucking intense,
man Yeah, it's a tough place and then on
[SPEAKER_01]: top of that you add a culture that I'm an
outsider.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I'm I'm according to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the epitome of what they don't like
they don't like People that come from the
[SPEAKER_01]: mainland by a piece of property,
you know, it's according to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's their it's their island It's their
you know, it's their spot They don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: people there and when you're on and when
you're on a rock in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_01]: ocean, there's no hiding You know,
everyone knows your business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone knows who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone knows if you're not a local
Everyone knows and that makes you a target
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean from security more community
vibes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep Yep, you You know, it's a You have to
absolutely love it if it's the most
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive state to live So you have to
fucking love it and we didn't I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what it came down to for us is we
didn't love it enough to To deal with it
[SPEAKER_01]: and we are so much happier to be back here
with family and you know You don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: what you have until it's gone type of
thing And we didn't realize how how big it
[SPEAKER_01]: would be and then the pandemic hit so we
weren't even able to travel off the island
[SPEAKER_01]: for fuck 18 months so, I mean it was it
was a it was a cauldron of of of stress
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know trying to figure it out and
trying to overcome these obstacles and You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, we're happy we did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've fucking especially about cannabis and
And my genetics in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned the Exactly like exactly the
threshold of what cannabis can take and
[SPEAKER_01]: what each line itself can take That's
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, there's no way to really learn
that unless you're thrown into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Yeah, I mean I I was humbled really
quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you know, I've been growing a
long time I was like, oh I'll figure it
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how hard could it be got this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got this little you know,
I'll have a rough run or two is what I
[SPEAKER_01]: figured and You know and I get there and
you know, it's it's constant pain Yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: being over in that environment that
Obviously had some play into you breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: towards, you know moisture resistance and
the high humidity and rot Botrytis and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something that you think you're
gonna continue breeding for being an
[SPEAKER_00]: organ?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes in the long term, yes At this exact
this year of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: No just because I'm indoor only You know
indoor I can't like if you don't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure you can't select for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the next year I'm going to be
focusing more on feminized lines and lines
[SPEAKER_01]: that are I hate to use the word hype or
you know exotic or whatever you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: call it but more Show boaty type lines,
you know more indoor Type stuff is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be what's coming out for at least the
next year Nothing wrong with that man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing wrong with that at all We have a
question from a follower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's one of yours Course says any
chance you ever plan on doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: one-to-one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I actually have Two or three that
I've made The big one that you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I pretty much pass it to anyone that wants
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't charge for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it the dragon's run Remedy it's the
sour tsunami cut to the dragon's dash and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's pretty easy to find a one-to-one
stuff and then you can also find some some
[SPEAKER_01]: more like 15 to 17 percent CBD and like
three to five percent DHCP knows As well
[SPEAKER_01]: and that one it has a nice turp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of has that sour diesel Ask with
some berries or some citrus coming from
[SPEAKER_01]: the dragon's side And that one,
you know, I've got a lot of see that I
[SPEAKER_01]: made a lot of them and you know Anyone can
DM me and I'll send them a pack of the
[SPEAKER_00]: dragons remedy That sounds awesome,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I definitely need to get
into he's been pushing me to to smoke more
[SPEAKER_00]: of the CBD heavies to get off cigarette
smoking So that might be something I'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting you up about pretty here Yeah,
Panda says which garlic stash do you
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer the 13 or the 21?
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally prefer the 21 the 21 has more
of the GMOs garlic side more of the skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: side more of the You know more of the
parts of the GMO that I like the 13 is
[SPEAKER_01]: more OG KB heavy and comes out more Garlic
cookie forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely has more of that dough side
that you know cookies is known for The 13
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers much faster like most people are
seeing, you know Most people I see pull
[SPEAKER_01]: that like seven to nine weeks and then the
21 is more in line with the dragons dash
[SPEAKER_01]: GMO side, which is You know 9 to 11 is
generally where I see people pulling the
[SPEAKER_01]: 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really comes down to your preference
GGG wants to know will Jeff continue
[SPEAKER_00]: expanding the landrace heirloom
preservation and unique crosses he's done
[SPEAKER_01]: in the past Yeah, I don't know which ones
I'm gonna do next Probably I think the
[SPEAKER_01]: next one I'm gonna do is I think I'm gonna
continue my Panamanian line, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: Panama red to the Bangui haze I took that
Yeah, it's a really fun one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some photos to it get I was able
to do one out in California and it means
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck in massive 18 foot tall 30 foot
around monster plants and it has that Kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of incense ammonia kind of lemon cleaner
side like the Panama has with the the
[SPEAKER_01]: Bangui haze is like a faster flowering
subcompact haze, you know, that one's like
[SPEAKER_01]: You know made for made for the shorter
season is where that Bangui haze Went so
[SPEAKER_01]: it kind of has something that you can do
outdoors in the Panamanian like most
[SPEAKER_01]: growers would be able to finish it It's so
it's not so exact or so thinly that you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, it takes a madman to To try to do it
I'll probably want to take that one to f3
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll probably the next one and then I
also want to get I want to take the
[SPEAKER_01]: Vietnamese black one more step.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that one I it needs I did I
already did an open pollination on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I want to do my next one I
actually want to select I want to go
[SPEAKER_01]: through when I want to find a find the
best female that I can but that will
[SPEAKER_01]: probably be Now a while down the road at
least a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say I Don't think I knew that you
didn't Opie of that a Vietnamese black.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty awesome, man I've been
wanting to grow that one for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What'd you find in that heritage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we did a Vietnamese black and then
we also did a Vietnamese the lot in Hawaii
[SPEAKER_01]: and so the black is more like swamp turps
There was like some cedar wood Sandalwood
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of turps in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some like pine saw We had one
that was like kind of like geraniums kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like that herbal tea almost and then
the lot was more like Sharp citrus and
[SPEAKER_01]: sharp lacquer like really more nose
assaulting whereas the black was more like
[SPEAKER_01]: Pleasant it's kind of how I don't know if
I'm conveying what I mean, but They're
[SPEAKER_01]: both really racy really long flower
Growing them next to each other you would
[SPEAKER_01]: believe that that they are both from
Vietnam, but they are a little different
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot Will go more colorful,
especially towards the end of Flower
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas the Vietnamese black is more like
straight black So is that something you
[SPEAKER_00]: said would say it was true breeding for is
that black hour?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah That's impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about the high off of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the highlight?
[SPEAKER_01]: heard mix really use Well, I mean it
depends if you like thinly it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely fucking potent if you don't
like if you don't like thinly it's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be Really overpowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty it's easy to overdo.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no ceiling like the more you smoke
I mean, it's pretty soaring I won't say it
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people find it paranoid I personally
didn't and my wife didn't I know some
[SPEAKER_01]: people though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people just get paranoid off of thin
leaves So I can't really say on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get paranoid But it definitely
it's a racy, you know, nothing like that I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean modern genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's absolutely no bag appeal No,
you know, it's really wispy long flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's You're not gonna you're not
gonna fill rooms with it I mean it means
[SPEAKER_00]: so much to people these days and some of
the best smokes I've had are from the
[SPEAKER_00]: worst looking buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I almost guarantee it, you know 90% of
the time the only time I've ever found it
[SPEAKER_01]: not to be true was the dragon stash And
that's that was pure pure dumb luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: The the red phenos end up being the
terpiest Every other line I've ever seen,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, usually the green phenom smokes
better, you know, usually the way it goes
[SPEAKER_01]: Tip straight from dragon slam genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, it's big in the market though right
now I mean people want the fast flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: and they want purple and they want gas I
mean that seems to be and they want hype
[SPEAKER_01]: and they want them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's that's what I hear anyway
from everyone that Bends my seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all ask us all ask the same questions
Yeah, and you've really been getting in
[SPEAKER_00]: the fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to talk about that quite a bit
What was it that calling for people asking
[SPEAKER_00]: for your genetics feminize that made you
get into it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or were you fucking around with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually was more so because I wanted
to preserve cuts Hawaii Decimated my
[SPEAKER_01]: library nearly every everything from the
last Six to eight years that I've hunted
[SPEAKER_01]: Hawaii killed it I have a few things that
I put into tissue culture with node labs
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'll be able to get back but I pretty
much Crop after crop watch more of my
[SPEAKER_01]: mom's die off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I that's why I wanted to get into
fems I reversed my orange dreams keeper,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I no longer have so I'm so So
thankful that I was able to reverse it
[SPEAKER_01]: before Hawaii killed it so that that's why
I got into fems is because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding and especially now When I
first started growing and when I would be
[SPEAKER_01]: buying seeds, I would never buy fems,
you know Usually I I'm gonna buy a seed
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for males as well because I
want to continue I want to work the line
[SPEAKER_01]: so and then on top of that Most of the
fems that I had run that I had seen run,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know the early process of a lot of
people used through like stressing or
[SPEAKER_01]: through root cutting There's all kinds of
crazy ways that people have used stress to
[SPEAKER_01]: make Feminine seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only more recently that people have
been doing it more like with you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sprays or STS or the elite spray Which I
just I just think it's a better process
[SPEAKER_01]: you know anything that's doing the At the
root manipulations to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a stress that the plant should be
able to overcome like I'm trying to breed
[SPEAKER_01]: stronger lines and so I've personally
always kind of Not been too impressed with
[SPEAKER_01]: fans just because of the process of how to
make them So it's been more the longer
[SPEAKER_01]: I've you know, I've been in the game and
more seen the more research I've done and
[SPEAKER_01]: the more people I've seen Doing fans and
doing them, right, especially,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, my mind is kind of open to them
But I do know market wise that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: people want more than regular so I mean
it's kind of It's kind of both really it's
[SPEAKER_01]: you know serving the need and you know
doing what made sense for me at the time
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, man, you said you make your
own spray right your own reversal spray
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, these look every time I've done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have I think I think I'm gonna try next
time I'm gonna use the pre-made elite
[SPEAKER_01]: spray this last one Well, and actually all
three of them really like the orange dream
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't really want to reverse either it
did and I you know, I did get a good
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of seeds of a few of the Line and
then the Mac dragon reversal that one went
[SPEAKER_01]: really well, but I also sprayed 12 huge
plants so I had You know backups of
[SPEAKER_01]: backups.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a whole army of plant matter that I
was that was being sprayed so just by the
[SPEAKER_01]: sheer size of what I was able to do I had
enough to pollinate the greenhouse and
[SPEAKER_01]: then I tried with the GMO cut and it
wouldn't reverse for me and then I just
[SPEAKER_01]: did the modified and it did like it made
male pollen sacks and a few of them did
[SPEAKER_01]: have pollen but for the 99% of them were
totally pollen free So I think the next
[SPEAKER_01]: time I'm gonna try the elite Stuff and see
if you know if I can get a better reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of it So do you think the amount of
pollen that comes off of these females?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it directly related to like the type
of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Reversal spray that you use or the
compounds that you use on it Or do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think there's some genetics that the
females just just like males there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: that Just naturally don't make very much
seed or drop very much pollen even though
[SPEAKER_01]: they're great Yeah, I I think it's both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's both factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some females are just really hard to
reverse You know and some like the orange
[SPEAKER_01]: dreams the thing with that one is that one
it was it was making a shit ton of pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem was it was so dense and so
thick I mean that's what that line does is
[SPEAKER_01]: it makes huge football colas and so it was
actually so dense That the pollen sacks
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't open properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the pollen that I was able to get
and what actually seeded was from me
[SPEAKER_01]: literally manually opening pulling
everything apart because anywhere that the
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen just would stick to the cluster it
would mold really fast like within two
[SPEAKER_01]: days you'd go out and add the moldy and
you'd look and you Investigate and pull it
[SPEAKER_01]: apart and it's like oh Well, there is a
big old glob of pollen that fell out that
[SPEAKER_01]: just stuck right there on the plant matter
and molded and then Some plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's just summer finicky,
you know as just the nature of farming it
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's You know, it's how much effort
you want to put into it like the like the
[SPEAKER_01]: modified I'm gonna get the damn thing to
reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna make seed off of it It might
take me if you try but it's gonna happen
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean it it It's farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always it's always a pain in the
ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's always there's always
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still always something I mean like
the perfect example like the and even
[SPEAKER_01]: males do this as I guess my example like
the last cycle in Hawaii that we did It
[SPEAKER_01]: was kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had already decided that we were gonna
put the farm up for sale We haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: decided time yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I so I had a crumble cake male that
when I stress tested it It was fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: phenomenal solid beautiful took way more
abuse Than what I thought it was going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to especially I mean that's a coup
E type line And so in the stress testing
[SPEAKER_01]: it was solid and so I had a whole
greenhouse 12 by 30 foot greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean beautiful plants huge male I would
have made mountains of seed and It threw
[SPEAKER_01]: female parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't do it in stress testing but it
did and What should have been the cake
[SPEAKER_01]: run, you know, it was getting fed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was a quote-unquote on track
and so that's actually Because for me if a
[SPEAKER_01]: male throws female parts, it's a wash like
that's not worth breeding with So it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like I chopped the garden down and I went
up and told my wife and I was like well I
[SPEAKER_01]: think we just got the fucking sign that
we're out of here because that cycle that
[SPEAKER_01]: we were waiting on just Maybe that was the
universe telling us to get the fuck off
[SPEAKER_01]: the rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know but Anyway, that I mean,
that's and that was a male that already
[SPEAKER_01]: had gone through stress testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean it that's farming So I have a
huge question to ask you here You
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned males throwing off female parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually talked to a couple breeders
where they said they prefer Males like
[SPEAKER_00]: that because they hold that female genetic
and the offspring are more likely to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce feminized Progeny, what do you
think about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I Think that's bro science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think herm is herm.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think Instability is
instability no matter how you slice it If
[SPEAKER_01]: a plant is willing to herm and you use it
you are passing along genetics That have
[SPEAKER_01]: the propensity to herm And for me,
this is This is my legacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I leave for the fucking world
right for me You know, I try to do the
[SPEAKER_01]: absolute best work I can and I personally
People don't forget when you see that one
[SPEAKER_01]: of their rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not forget that it has something
that you know Leaves a mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does it does You know fuck up someone
Yeah, oh, it's never their fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always So just to play devil's
advocate here you're saying absolutely no
[SPEAKER_00]: instability is instability how about Males
that throw resin that are heavy on resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually typically a female,
you know trait Males always have a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of resin, but the ones that are
overly coated with it I Love those males.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the ones that I tend to look for
if a male has Grease then I usually the
[SPEAKER_01]: prodigy will have grease and I shouldn't
even say what people want to do with what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're gonna run for themselves Have a
happy like some of the greatest strains in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis history are accidents I mean,
that's that's the way, you know what I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more just It's understanding that
if you're passing that along in your
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics and then you're selling those
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's The difference and even still if
you have a male that does that it does
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw let's say it throws a few hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say it throws a fucking hundred
hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, let's go to both extremes If you
run through the genetics yourself You
[SPEAKER_01]: actually test those seeds and you stress
test those seeds and you see oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, they're solid the male might have
had issues But if that didn't get passed
[SPEAKER_01]: along but that's where stress testing
comes in and that's where you know running
[SPEAKER_01]: those seeds and You know, everyone has
their own different standards,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, this is Every time I open
Instagram, there's a hundred new breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean this is everyone's different
standards Everyone has their own
[SPEAKER_01]: paintbrush so to speak for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to grow herms I don't want to
sell herm seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me from from my selections a herm
is a kill That that's a solid point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I get behind for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it very important to Do stress
testing on a genetics that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: providing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people I mean,
I'm not gonna say names, but there's one
[SPEAKER_00]: guy in specific that drives me insane and
he always talks about how cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Naturally has that hermaphrodite trait
because of its ability to reproduce itself
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it doesn't get pollinated to carry
on those genetics So his claim is that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to stress test any of these
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's gonna be herms and everything How
do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an interesting standard to have I
mean if we're gonna go off of that I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: think of all the plants that we have made
off of so I mean that That's our job as
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders in my opinion is to push the line
forward and to make the line better for
[SPEAKER_01]: the for the next run and so for me Yeah,
there are a lot of lines that do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a self-preservation tactic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a hundred percent true It is a
self-preservation tactic and it's our job
[SPEAKER_01]: as at least for me Anyway, it's my job as
a breeder to minimize that to remove it
[SPEAKER_01]: from As best I can from mine and if it's
present like perfect example, I made the
[SPEAKER_01]: peanut butter breast orange dreams About
30% of them herm that's like I've you know
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 30% that's probably even higher than
what it really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just sticks out in my mind So I always
over exaggerate for in my mind But the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that don't herm are phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've had people that are like,
oh bro, you know I got this from this
[SPEAKER_01]: person or that person And it was
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to grow it and I tell them well,
I don't sell those seeds or they herm This
[SPEAKER_01]: is their you know, their rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had people that are like,
well, I don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to run them anyway You know,
everyone can make that own their own
[SPEAKER_01]: choice for their garden and you know Some
people a lot of people have actually come
[SPEAKER_01]: out of that line which to me was a wasted
project like once I thought of that rate
[SPEAKER_01]: was that high to me like it just sits in
the back of my fridge and Say la vie,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, maybe I'll use it for a seed
sprout tea someday, but that's You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Yeah, everyone had I stayed mine for
and I didn't see a big I didn't see a big
[SPEAKER_00]: jump over like a corn sst.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah end up just being food Boil them
shuck them put them on salad.
[SPEAKER_00]: We good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would you say was an acceptable?
[SPEAKER_01]: herm re That's a very varied question and
something that I released I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: see more than one or two herm reports and
I am for those herm reports I want them to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a reason and I want to be able to
find the reason But generally,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I my standard is I expect that
everyone that pops a pack of my seeds is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to find Something terpy something
that they can finish in their climate zone
[SPEAKER_01]: something that has resistance You know,
that's great smoke in every pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basically where my standard is and
if they can't if that can't Be done then
[SPEAKER_01]: you know Like my fridge is full of lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to make seed let me just say
that is really easy to make seed but
[SPEAKER_01]: making sure that it's actually worth
something and You know worth growing
[SPEAKER_01]: because I mean, I know how it is for me I
only have so much space what I put in that
[SPEAKER_01]: space matters and I know that that's
that's more the norm then Will we go ham?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pop whatever the hell you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So You know, that's what that's what I try
to aim for Absolutely, I appreciate you
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely you can breed for stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's absolutely Doable and these people
that are telling you, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't matter it does They're just not
willing to put in the work as far as I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned So let me ask you the hard
question now out of everything that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever made Let's say top three.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be the top three strains so far
that you go?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want this to represent what I've done
Well, the first one would be easy to
[SPEAKER_01]: dragon stash that is the sum of You know
all of my time growing and breeding has
[SPEAKER_01]: gone into making that strain And it's
going to be one that I'm going to continue
[SPEAKER_01]: working.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I actually just ran out of the s3
green Version, so it's probably going to
[SPEAKER_01]: move up the list because that is our
flagship line You know the so I've got the
[SPEAKER_01]: red version and I've got the green version
s3 of the dragon stash The red version
[SPEAKER_01]: tends to go like blueberry fuel Blueberry
funk, you know, generally those are the
[SPEAKER_01]: words that I hear When people describe the
blue are the the dragon stash red,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the green is more like a citrus
kush or like a sour citrus and not like
[SPEAKER_01]: that tangy type turp like the actual true
citrus peels like actual fresh citrus not
[SPEAKER_01]: that artificial like candy tangy turp and
So the number two would probably be
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the modified Macberry moonshine
would probably be number two Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really happy with You know,
it's a it's it's a damn good one and so
[SPEAKER_01]: far everyone that tries it loves it I'd
say probably number three would probably
[SPEAKER_01]: be the missy stash actually Which is so
that's my wife's favorite Congolese kush
[SPEAKER_01]: to my dragon stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's basically my wife's favorite
strain to my favorite strain combined into
[SPEAKER_01]: one and that Last I heard anyway,
I don't know if it still is but it has at
[SPEAKER_01]: the surf record in Massachusetts in their
legal system at like six point,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like six point seven what they
had set it at And it's you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's one that's been really special
because obviously it's you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of my wife's favorites and one of my
favorite so that's probably Probably those
[SPEAKER_01]: those three The blackberry moonshine
probably would also like that's probably a
[SPEAKER_01]: close tie to third
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think I mean there's I've made a
lot of I may have a lot of lines over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years You know, so it's it's really hard
to narrow them down, but I'd say those are
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the tops So let's hear a little
bit about what Made you decide to make
[SPEAKER_00]: your own strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: What brought you in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna try my hand at breeding Yeah,
so I grew up in California and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where I learned to grow I was in like the
Amazon Calaveras County line area And in
[SPEAKER_01]: that area you could pretty much any strain
could go out in a 200 gallon pot and if
[SPEAKER_01]: you could keep it watered You'd you'd see
the potential that plant was You could
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much finish anything and then I
moved to Oregon after a divorce and I
[SPEAKER_01]: brought all of my California genetics with
me and That first season in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my ass handed to me with mold and At
that time when I was looking around I
[SPEAKER_01]: could not find people in my area that were
breeding that were making outdoor seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: and So for me, I've always like I do
indoor I love indoor but what I my passion
[SPEAKER_01]: is is the outdoors the full-term monsters
So that's generally where my focus goes
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoor, you know just dial your rooms in
but outdoors that's genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what your plants can take and so
When I had that year when everything
[SPEAKER_01]: molded on me that I brought from
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, okay Well, what am I gonna
run next year?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was like well fuck there's
there's not much that I'm seeing so it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like Research, you know, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well this speed line has good,
you know people have said, okay Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: this does good in their climate in Canada
or this, you know Oh there this guy's
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding out in Maine or this,
you know, it was like trying to find these
[SPEAKER_01]: These strains that I heard about that,
you know, oh someone said it did Got on
[SPEAKER_01]: mold resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ran, you know shit ton of all these
different lines trying to find Okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: well this one and this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and then it was okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well now I need to make seeds combine them
and Run them the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean that's pretty much how I
started was was for myself like I I would
[SPEAKER_01]: have never predicted dragon flame
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I would have never predicted selling
seeds or You know anyone even giving it a
[SPEAKER_01]: shit about my seeds to be honest So it was
you know, that's just where it developed
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you know word of mouth and You
know people hear about it and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at that time I was selling a lot of
pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much what was paying for
everything was flour so it was You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just all of it combining really is how DfG
and breeding started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, man, what's been some of your
favorite smokes that you didn't create?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Well, I'm a sucker for a great og TK 92
og SFB the the the classics Death star is
[SPEAKER_01]: another one of you know, one of my
all-time favorites The
[SPEAKER_01]: old super skunk cut I think that one comes
to mind a lot but I think about And then
[SPEAKER_01]: one of my buddies Hemlock was what his
handle was back in the old days on the
[SPEAKER_01]: forums And he gave me a shit ton of seeds
one of them was that dream lotus sensei
[SPEAKER_01]: star and he called it foobar and It's
still to this day what in my mind what I
[SPEAKER_01]: compare everything potency wise to I mean
true To this day still one of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: true one hitter quitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean at that time I was moving pounds
like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was had a roommate We were both that's
all we did was move pounds and so we Saw a
[SPEAKER_01]: shit ton of flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were in Sacramento at that time so I
saw a shit ton of California flour really
[SPEAKER_01]: great flour and had access to it all the
time and I remember rolling that joint and
[SPEAKER_01]: I I hit it and I handed it in to him and
we were trying to play Call of Duty and we
[SPEAKER_01]: pass it back and forth and we both were
both just Going down into the fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: chair Dude, why are we dying so much?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man I mean there and it was that was
some I mean, although honestly a lot Of a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of hemlock lines had that were really
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's probably out of anyone unknown,
especially I mean if he had marketed and
[SPEAKER_01]: branded himself He'd be a he'd be a pillar
in his community, but he didn't so He's an
[SPEAKER_01]: unknown person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just you know Some people are for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people just get their genetics out
there and are happy with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep So is there is there any breeders that
you truly respect?
[SPEAKER_00]: That you would look forward to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah Like two-tone genetics is one
we've done some collabs together great
[SPEAKER_01]: great palette high standards great breeder
great guy Matchmaker genetics out of
[SPEAKER_01]: Hawaii is another you know passion first
in breeding He's breeding in Hawaii as
[SPEAKER_01]: well for tough clients Two dog seeds is
here in Oregon another great longtime
[SPEAKER_01]: grower Very passion forward in his work
meticulous about sourcing and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He kind of has a bad rep for rep for
naming things but hazeman I've held a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of great work out of hazeman's lines,
but you know, you kind of got to be
[SPEAKER_01]: careful about What's what sometimes but
he's you know, he knows how to select
[SPEAKER_01]: Males, I'll say that for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows how the plant works and how to
how to make nice lines The lucky dog seed
[SPEAKER_01]: co is one that I you know I'm Like digging
through their packs and I'm going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: digging through more of their packs
looking for some of the old-school chem
[SPEAKER_01]: type stuff El jefe is great as well
old-school, you know old-school guy But I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean I think I think it's pretty much for
me is the people that that I gravitate to
[SPEAKER_01]: or people that are doing it for the
passion of the plant not for You know
[SPEAKER_00]: making for the clout or the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, you got to be driven by
the passion Yeah, keep and the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't you see it you see it real quick
Yep, they might wear a mask for a year or
[SPEAKER_00]: two and then boom It's out there Yeah,
it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always heard the saying Hype is a
test of a strain but time Is a test of a
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder and you know, you're around long
enough your reputation your reputation
[SPEAKER_01]: comes out You know who who you are what
your standards are what you are putting
[SPEAKER_01]: out into the world You can't hide that
shit forever people figure it out Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what have you been smoking on the most
lately?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I picked up from can essentials I
grabbed a Half I think of the modified
[SPEAKER_01]: mackberry when we first landed So I've
been smoking mostly on that and then go
[SPEAKER_01]: into the dispensary right now now sadly
You know just grab it what I can find that
[SPEAKER_01]: looks decent enough and I have my first
cycle coming down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm week six right now, so I'll have my
homegrown I'm so looking forward to my own
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that you like your flowers so
that's just you know Nothing that compares
[SPEAKER_00]: to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank all my followers for
coming in all of your followers for coming
[SPEAKER_00]: in and checking out the stream This was an
absolutely great interview and I look
[SPEAKER_00]: forward to having you on sessions I don't
know if you're willing to smoke on camera
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are we'll have to have to get
you in for an episode of sessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit We're having our smoke session now
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that for the answer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't let you do it alone, brother We
got to get a dab in here Was that that
[SPEAKER_00]: mackberry moonshine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so this is what I've got left What a
jar Yeah No, they I you know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those things It's so surreal
to go into a shop and see something that
[SPEAKER_01]: you made on the shelf But to see something
that like they grow with love in their
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and you can like why toward their
farm I've been to a lot of shit show rec
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me fucking say that I've been to a lot
of I don't vouch for very many like I can
[SPEAKER_01]: count on one hand how many I will vouch
for and they are one of them Everything
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grabbed from them has been You know
truly truly done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and so it's really awesome to see
someone that I mean, they're filling
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses with that cut So it's it's
really cool to see someone that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: using one of my strains that doesn't write
That's always such a great feeling You
[SPEAKER_01]: mind uh mind sharing a horror story I
think the biggest one that I my wife and I
[SPEAKER_01]: still laugh about he was down in Grant
Pass and It was one of those facilities
[SPEAKER_01]: when I walked in my wife and I looked at
each other and we like What could we do
[SPEAKER_01]: with this fucking spot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was right on the river and they had
I mean it was probably 50 acres and They
[SPEAKER_01]: had this crazy like octagon two-story
building and then On one side they had
[SPEAKER_01]: huge warehouse space and then I'm right in
front it was like picturesque next to the
[SPEAKER_01]: river they had a they had the permit to do
a tier two here in Oregon and I came down
[SPEAKER_01]: in the consulting row to try to help save
their grow is basically what my Meeting
[SPEAKER_01]: was for and I got there and they had I
think they had nine growers working there
[SPEAKER_01]: and My wife she's not a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a nurse she came with me and Sure
her not being the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's just exposed to it because of me she
walked into their warehouse and was like
[SPEAKER_01]: what the fuck are you guys doing and they
had Literally every pest they had russets.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had rude aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had them all they had shelf of avid
they had shelf of eagle 20 and four bed
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything you're not supposed to be
fucking doing and I mean Hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: lights in their warehouse and this was
like mid June July So in my mind my plants
[SPEAKER_01]: at that time were four foot tall already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to this rec space I'm
expecting to see a field of fucking plants
[SPEAKER_01]: They have anything planted yet and they
were making I think they said like $12,000
[SPEAKER_01]: was what each grower was making a month
there and I straight up looked at all of
[SPEAKER_01]: them I was like y'all fucking robbing this
guy because their garden was I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: straight up every thing you weren't
supposed to be doing and the the owner was
[SPEAKER_01]: there and he had been in a motorcycle
accident or something and He literally
[SPEAKER_01]: pulled out his bike and and right in front
of my wife and I had started like crushing
[SPEAKER_01]: it up and snorting it and looked at her
and Well, you're the nurse you should be
[SPEAKER_01]: okay with this and we're like you're
fucking crazy like no you like and then he
[SPEAKER_01]: got a call from a dispensary that they
were like are we need those clones that
[SPEAKER_01]: you promised us and he was like,
oh, yeah I'll bring them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some off for you and I looked at I
was like I just told you all of those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants should be fucking burned like Start
over just burn them like they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: they're fucking infested and you've been
using every chemical So now they're
[SPEAKER_01]: they're fucking immune to avid like you're
not gonna go put that on a fucking shelf
[SPEAKER_01]: to give to patients This was in the you
know very early days of rec when they
[SPEAKER_01]: still had medical Like you could go to the
dispensary and if you were a medical
[SPEAKER_01]: patient, you might be buying that flower
sprayed with Fucking avid and I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh man, I was I still pisses me off to
this day and he did I mean he ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: taking those fucking cuts to the
dispensary to put on the shelf fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: russet mites rude aphids sprayed with
fucking everything and Obviously,
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't end up taking the job because if
you're gonna be that like that's your
[SPEAKER_01]: morals then you can go fuck yourself No
shit Those russets man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just those alone are a fucking Nightmare
rude aphids on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Well, it's an insane story man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I take russet mites any day over the
week over rude aphids rude aphids are like
[SPEAKER_01]: they're never had married aphids so I can
But I've had them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had them once and I will never
fucking forget it like oh man,
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck those pets And you had the russets
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I've had russets a few times over the
years russets are if you use wettable
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur pretty easy to knock out russet,
you know those For a while they were
[SPEAKER_01]: really a pain in the ass But once once
figured out wettable sulfur and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty easy to get rid of So I feel that
every one of these obstacles that you face
[SPEAKER_00]: in agriculture is a learning experience
Because once it's happened it's already
[SPEAKER_00]: there You might as well learn from instead
of getting into that state of mind where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just crushed and upset about it You
know and just kind of giving up it
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything happens for a reason and that
builds that knowledge of how to deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: that pest of how to deal with that
situation So when I first got russets,
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not take it seriously I took it like
most pets that I have met up to there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna try a few different things
we're gonna start with like, you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: lowest chance and Kind of build up to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already lost this crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not okay with flowering these out,
you know, they're damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're stressed out So we might as well
see what works on these fuggers So I
[SPEAKER_00]: actually kept the russets around in an
indoor environment for like six months
[SPEAKER_00]: lower-end products like your your natural
like a insecticidal soap and shit like
[SPEAKER_00]: that they weren't really doing anything to
it and Yeah, if you don't kill them with
[SPEAKER_00]: that, they do become immune to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They burrow into your stems Some of it
won't even get touched by it, you know So
[SPEAKER_00]: the only thing I found at the end was
heating up my room because that was kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of keeping them out of the out of the
stocks and the stems of the clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: Then using that wettable sulfur and
spraying that down and you gotta be
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, it's not that hard it's just a
matter of Work ethic and consistency being
[SPEAKER_00]: on top for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's that's farming a hundred
percent There's no replacement for the
[SPEAKER_01]: gardener shadow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's the way it is the more work
you put into it The better your crop is I
[SPEAKER_01]: had one guy that he had multiple tents in
his warehouse and he had spider mites like
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy and But his garage was like hoarded
and I kept telling him you were never
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna get rid of spider mites Until you
clean this garage out because you might
[SPEAKER_01]: spray your tent They're in all of that
right there behind you too and he had his
[SPEAKER_01]: dogs that would come through his grow and
I was like Until you keep your pets out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the grow you're like they are bringing
them in and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not in this barn anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on your property.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're On the trail every trail your dog
takes they are on just waiting But that's
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's the way farming is is it
yes I mean, I know a lot of growers that
[SPEAKER_00]: let their animals into their grow and it
gives me a heart attack every single time
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, like you said especially
with dogs that are running around outside
[SPEAKER_00]: and aren't house dogs You know and you're
not regularly washing them or you just
[SPEAKER_00]: took them for a walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's gonna be shit Yeah, even if it's
just dust mites, you're gonna have a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem Yeah, yeah, I mean it's something
that I struggle with too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I have it I have animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're part of the family so I get it You
know and I you know, I've been a hippie
[SPEAKER_01]: outlaw like I the idea of wearing like lab
Suit type stuff doesn't really vibe with
[SPEAKER_01]: the idea of a garden But especially indoor
I mean just my little man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, I mean on the on the indoor
especially cleanliness is everything clean
[SPEAKER_01]: rooms are much much much easier to
maintain and You know the cleaner you can
[SPEAKER_01]: keep it the less problems you generally
will have Is that part of your SOP going
[SPEAKER_01]: into your grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of time yeah, I will and I try not to
wear the same clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do the lab coat I probably should
Yeah, I don't go that far but I do go in
[SPEAKER_01]: with clean clothes And I never go from one
to the next like if I go if I work in this
[SPEAKER_01]: garden I don't wear those same clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go take those clothes off I take a
shower before I go into another garden
[SPEAKER_01]: just not only for the pest but also
because I work with pollen that I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to take pollen where I don't want
pollen to be and it's so easy to do that
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's You know, it's all just part of
part of what you just have to do to do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know really well Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would be one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of your best tips for a beginner grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man Well, I think when I was a new
grower I think what I tended to do was
[SPEAKER_01]: over love the plant and over Overdo it
like it's so easy to over water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so easy to Over love when you're when
you're first learning And so I'd say
[SPEAKER_01]: that's probably probably the biggest thing
is to start learn like the biggest process
[SPEAKER_01]: About growing I'd say is learning to
replant learning to understand What what
[SPEAKER_01]: they want what they look like when they're
not getting what they want and how to fix
[SPEAKER_01]: it I mean, I think those are that's the
underlying key for for success I would say
[SPEAKER_01]: the faster you can learn to replant you
know the The better the better adapt you
[SPEAKER_01]: will because happy plants make happy
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the way it is stress plants
You're not gonna get what you want out of
[SPEAKER_00]: a stress plant exactly Definitely a good
tip right there over watering is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: the biggest problem with most beginner new
growers I didn't over loving like though
[SPEAKER_00]: more water does not equal faster growth
Nope, it's all about those dry down times
[SPEAKER_00]: and can score consistent Yeah water so
great tip on that Thank you for everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in from Dragon's flame side and my
followers.

[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking badass, man How'd you come
across that big Green Day fan?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no, not really actually But I am so we
did a season in Mendocino on Pigeon Ridge
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's outside of cobalo, which is
outlaw Grow country basically murder
[SPEAKER_01]: mountain But it's in Mendo not humbled and
so spy rock is the if the Emerald Triangle
[SPEAKER_01]: is the epicenter of Cannabis spy rock is
what I would consider the epicenter of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald Triangle it was In the height of
prohibition you were invite only There was
[SPEAKER_01]: armed guards blocking spy rock you did not
go There if you were not a grower and if
[SPEAKER_01]: you were not invited So it's you know
outlaw country basically that where this
[SPEAKER_01]: really you know where this movement that
you know We're all a part of now We know I
[SPEAKER_01]: would say was the heart of it So,
I mean it's it's something I've always
[SPEAKER_01]: it's always fascinated me that area You
know, especially especially the year that
[SPEAKER_01]: I was there hearing the og tails You know
people that had to hike a kayak and hike
[SPEAKER_01]: Every literally everything in You know
really far into into the into the
[SPEAKER_01]: wilderness to grow this plant and how
spoiled we all are now to have it when our
[SPEAKER_01]: house is so No shit.
