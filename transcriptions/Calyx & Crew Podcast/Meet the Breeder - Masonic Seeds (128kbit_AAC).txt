[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fucking I live on my phone man.

[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no Hey, you got to make time for
yourself, but I see you doing that too
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get into all this shit You know
some people here aware of you aware of
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the controversy that goes around
with Masonic Seiko We're gonna dig into
[SPEAKER_03]: all of that today With with your guidance,
you know, if you don't want to talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: something you just let me know But we're
gonna get into some controversial shit But
[SPEAKER_03]: first off I really want to get to know who
you are, you know as a person So why don't
[SPEAKER_03]: we just start off with the easy shit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how'd you get into cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your first experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoking weed Like like in ninth grade
smoking weed I enjoyed it when I smoked it
[SPEAKER_00]: and Just kept smoking every day never
stopped and then Kind of like played with
[SPEAKER_00]: a seed here and there from a bag seat
throw it in some dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what happens all this like a age 15 16
and then finally when I turned like 18 I
[SPEAKER_00]: Decided I wanted to grow some pot to try
to emulate the weed that I was smoking So
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up growing pot because I had a
habit that I had to sustain Fair enough
[SPEAKER_03]: fair enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember what some of those first taps
that you ever smoked on were So I started
[SPEAKER_00]: a smoking weed Like I grew up on in South
Central on a on a street called Avalon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like it's 111th and Avalon It's like
kind of ghetto there, you know And The the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed we grew up on was stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they called.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was brick weed stress is brick weed
usually weed sent in from Mexico Super
[SPEAKER_00]: compacted because they had to like hide it
and and you know during transportation
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever which way and this weed would be
full of seeds so you would get your $5
[SPEAKER_00]: nickel bag and you would break it all down
and we would smoke it in blunts because it
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't taste that good in joints and then
blunts lasted longer that was our
[SPEAKER_00]: rhetoric.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started with stress and blunts
Upgraded to like chronic Kush og and then
[SPEAKER_00]: start hitting the medical dispensaries
like we'll have a big homie go like a you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, or a big homie would be have his
card and we'd always go cop off him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ironically today when I was at the post
office I ran into like one of my first
[SPEAKER_00]: plugs from when I was like a kid and and
and I recognized his wife because she used
[SPEAKER_00]: to sell the weed for him too and I'm like
that's her and I look up and he's there
[SPEAKER_00]: too and I'm like, hey, what's up create?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's all he looked at me like because you
know, we're in the we're in the we're in
[SPEAKER_00]: the post office and Watts like ghetto is
fucked and he's just like like on his
[SPEAKER_00]: guard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you don't remember me like I
used to buy weed off of you almost every
[SPEAKER_00]: day and he's just like and then it clicked
and then he just had this big shit eating
[SPEAKER_00]: grin on his face and I'm like,
yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like it all paid off because that's
what I'm doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Motherfucker and then I just left and that
happened what like three hours ago maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's how I grew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up buying weed on the streets of
South Central Los Angeles and upgraded my
[SPEAKER_00]: way to the dispensary and then it all just
kind of unraveled from there from ghetto
[SPEAKER_03]: to ghetto respect for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We called it Mersh up here instead of
stress, but it was the same shit fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: bag ass shit from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see that you're still smoking on the
blunts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a preferred blunt rap?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those pearls are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones from Paxton pearls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys do good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fairly new, but most stores don't
carry those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I'll find these gravels right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These gravel leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm smoking right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big ass green one that comes and
it's like this big.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one comes with two nice chunks that
are kind of already cut out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm smoking right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like smoking leaves, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see me smoking a leaf every now
and then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I could say the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we got that shit around
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get what's at the gas station.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day it was a pop can,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's the stress right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what will be healthy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting some of this pain off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you start growing this like freshman
year we're saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say about ninth grade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dabbled.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dabbled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like pop a seed, put it in the dirt,
water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for funsies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always grew like a seed on the side,
but started growing for like cash crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some pots in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like somewhere around 18 years old,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right after high school when my pops had
bought me a pound of sour diesel because I
[SPEAKER_00]: graduated high school as like a
congratulations gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't necessarily re-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of smoked most of it and
bought dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just a kid, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it was all gone, I'm just like,
what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And my dad's like, talk to Ray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ray knows about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he ended up, Ray convinced my dad to go
buy like 10, 15 gallon drums and like a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of dirt and just throw the clones in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rats ended up chewing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even then I wasn't like I was just
like, ah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it wasn't it wasn't a concept
that I understood yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally the fire was getting
hotter under my ass where the sour diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: pound started to deplete more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, another pound wasn't going
to come around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a one time gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were supposed to figure it out,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, I got to grow weed just
like my dad was about to grow weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: how we were going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the rats ate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I little by little just started buying
dirt, putting bag seeds in the ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: any random clone that, you know,
me or any of my family members would get
[SPEAKER_00]: at a clone from a first time patient deal
or whatever, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring it over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and next, you know, we started
with six plants and then 12 and then 24
[SPEAKER_00]: and then fucking let's fill up all the
space.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, is that is that how it goes now?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just whatever we can pack in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of how I do my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's it's even hard to pack in the
space now because it's just I move so so
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, fuck, that's already done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to fill it up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's just it's it's it's becoming a
whole ass job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm not bitching.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, like filling the gaps,
filling the gaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, like, I'm not worried about,
you know, we're doing it how it's always
[SPEAKER_00]: been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, just filling the gaps,
you know, whatever happens happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So leading from growing into breathing
growing kind of came out of necessity.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you make that transition growing
to breeding?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how how long was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what was the why?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I graduated high school in 2010,
probably started, found out what making
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds was in like 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was growing for like six years cash
crop, blasting it all, selling it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary, smoking it just on top of the
world, just smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was smoking my own fucking backyard
boogie, not worried about nobody's shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I find Instagram and I was
never on forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what a forum was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did kind of find this one forum,
but I was like, ah, the same for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm just I'm just going to grow weed
and make slabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I didn't know about,
you know, all the sessions that were
[SPEAKER_00]: happening around me, all the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that's what I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew real life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went into Instagram and I meet some
people and they know all these this this
[SPEAKER_00]: terminology, all these clones,
all this jargon, all these breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just right there like,
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: First breeder to kick me a bone was Harry
Palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harry Palms sent me a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and he's like, have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, I'm still growing for
flour, like I'm a flour grower or a B.H.O.
[SPEAKER_00]: maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people started saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people is bringing back memories
of that backyard shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, a lot of people start noticing
that I'm growing some killer genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I at the time that I'm growing these
these genetics, those the Tropicana cherry
[SPEAKER_00]: pie tangy, it was the cherry pie tangy
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bloom had or Harry had a cherry pie tangy
line at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: This story is like deja vu.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're good, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember this happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time that I'm growing them out,
it's the same time that Burner and Jungle
[SPEAKER_00]: Boys were having a collaborative effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the strains under the the the
the brand that they were launching,
[SPEAKER_00]: the exotics brand, was a Tropic Thunder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tropic Thunder happened to be the
Tropicana cherry pie tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wasn't necessarily growing the same
clone or feno or whatever they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were hyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was growing the same seed stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and me, I'm just like, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I hyped myself up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like, yo, that's dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I got that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone that followed me is like,
yeah, you do got that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and and I'm just like,
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, still not thinking about making
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get some males and I'm just like,
cool, I got some males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should make some seeds with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, but I don't want to
jeopardize my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I reached out to Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yo, who here in SoCal wants to
help me make some seeds with this killer
[SPEAKER_00]: stud that I found?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure enough, somebody reaches out and they
go, they make the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bring them back to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and it's just like, I'm just like,
hey, who wants to buy some seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are like, oh, and you know,
just like nowadays, I wasn't charging what
[SPEAKER_00]: people charge back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: One hundred and fifty bucks, two hundred a
pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, give me sixty bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me sixty bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sixty bucks sold Agent Orange Tropicana
cherry pie tangy and plush berry Tropicana
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry pie tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although sold, you know, people started
growing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody loves them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understood the concept of making
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the whole nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you take a picture, you put on your
page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was back in the day when it was
more like, you know, damn, look at this
[SPEAKER_00]: picture, you know, and nowadays it's like,
yeah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at Oreos.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We post the pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody goes crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody goes crazy, but I kind of
get a following as a seed maker in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and then I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That sold pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I didn't have to use that much space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have to dry all this weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the package at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That felt good.
[SPEAKER_00]: People respect the vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just kind of just rolling with the
punches like, damn, like I can make seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: like that's allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I'm while I'm doing that,
not too many people knew who I was or gave
[SPEAKER_00]: a fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the people that followed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually I end up getting like
the the tools to make Wilson and a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of other varieties on my second visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Oni and Harry came to Atalanto in
California, like two hours away from Los
[SPEAKER_00]: Angeles, and I drove my ass down there to
go meet Harry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave me five papaya Fems and a
Tropicana F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took that back home, grew them all
out and made some dope ass crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of how it all unraveled.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for the most part, that's the
abridged version for the most part.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that fucking real,
bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, just a reminder, if you've got
questions for Big Mace, we're going to do
[SPEAKER_03]: a rapid fire at the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: So members, you guys can get your
questions in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I opened up the Q&A already.
[SPEAKER_03]: So whenever you guys are ready,
throw them in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it'll be like the last 15 minutes of
the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're smoking on a blunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't talk about that at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you smoking, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have the I live like 20, 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way from Capuletors shop that he does is
work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to it's called LA made peace of
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to peace of green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bought a couple of flavors about Mac
one, because that's the shit, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: is Cap Cut or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had some RS 11 at 20 bucks and eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, give me two of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: About some sunset sure, because I like
sunset sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bought his shirt banger 22 because I
wanted to see what a shirt banger 22
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes like growing by their facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bought some, uh, the strain that
they dropped with Sea Junkie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got this clone as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the, uh, Biscotti Gelato 41.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had some other shit there too,
but that's what I went for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a, I'm a sucker for, you know,
candy and gas and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had like some hazy shit and you know,
some other shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm that's cool and all respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no disrespect, but anything,
but like I'm trying to smoke some
[SPEAKER_00]: flavorful stuff right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I had to ask you, like, you got a
top strain of all time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I guess it changes with the times,
but right now is Skittles is my go-to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard you saying that one that's and
that's not too new at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool that that's stuck
around for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it about the Skittles that you
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the perfect amount of like,
it's like a, it's like a, it's like a,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not gas, like sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, or like, you know, like headband or
GMO or like anything one might perceive as
[SPEAKER_00]: gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's its own type of like Kush chronic
gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, and, and that I know I'm just
describing like a strain like Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's like its own type of dope weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like when he came out,
like everything that was just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: related to OG, you wanted to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Skittles is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every hybrid and derivative of Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's the same thing that
happened with OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's like planetaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the SFB, the Skywalker,
the fire OG, the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all, I know a sour diesel and OG,
they're kind of like, you could separate
[SPEAKER_00]: them, but they all fall in that same
realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they're not piney.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not to me, like as a, as a smoker
and as a, as a seed maker and breeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, like this is how I look at the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your answer is your answer, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't gotta fucking explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know how people are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, that's not, so what are you
talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more of a fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, gas, fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gases cause fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's this smell like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking smells like dirty monkey ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you never smelled that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO is more funky, but you sometimes you
find that nice derivative of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got some, some gas in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've definitely been fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some like, I do another show called the
Washington weed review because I feel like
[SPEAKER_03]: no matter what you guys all agree on,
there's something that we can all agree
[SPEAKER_03]: on.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fucking medical and home grow is
always going to be better than dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like nine times out of 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but because of that, we wanted to go
out there and we wanted to tell some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the guys local around Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yo, you are going to go to the
disco.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this one that I'm saying is pretty
fucking good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have been trying out some hype shit
and I've been finding some stuff that I
[SPEAKER_03]: do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I heard you talking shit about the
Oreos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you look like the Oreos?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like the, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like the Oreos for the record.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, don't like hate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are like tough words for a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the plant didn't do nothing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't say that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't like the, the fanfare behind
it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the, yo, look at this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, yeah, it looks nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it even smells cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got this neat smell, but that smell
you will never taste no matter how well
[SPEAKER_00]: it's grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had it five or 10 times from
different growers in different shapes and
[SPEAKER_00]: forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, damn, this smells nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's, what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that smell and it just don't,
it don't translate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't do the job and in hash form and
in weed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've yet to grab Oreos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, or, or hybrid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's that leans Oreos.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, okay, I get it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I'm not, there's some strains
that took me a while to get privy to,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the Oreos I, I can't accept the,
the, the fanfare behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, like the other day I seen,
uh, I think they're still selling that one
[SPEAKER_00]: strain zero gravity as, as like a,
as a thing I seen, you know, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: no disrespect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just calling out names, but I seen,
uh, they just opened a dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like doing this whole ad about
how they got this dope as drop on this
[SPEAKER_00]: Oreo strain called zero gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they made this whole video for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, that weed sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm with you, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So since we're already in this realm right
here, least favorite strain of all time,
[SPEAKER_03]: unless it is Oreos.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's a hard question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, least favorite strain of all time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck, you know, there's gotta be one that
you just like, I would never smoke that
[SPEAKER_03]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, uh, anything that's like, uh,
like perfume me, whatever that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love, I don't disregard any strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the Oreos is hard for me to be like,
oh, that's the worst strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause Hey man, you might be able to breed
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day I might try it and I might like
it, but so far the 10 times I've had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: From cool woods now, but I can't disregard
a strain like that, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's not good for big Mesa's body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put no train wreck in my dab shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll smoke it when I want to
smoke it, but don't come over here telling
[SPEAKER_00]: me train wreck and Jack hair is the best
terp in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the old school thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people really love it,
but don't tell me it's the best thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best thing for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not, I was never really huge on the
Jack.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the effect is kind of uplifting,
but like the flavor, I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people that have worked with it,
call it Jack Terps for a reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like it's like that spicy kind
of weak kind of, eh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not crazy about it either.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what if we took the Jack hair and we
bred that shit with Skittles?
[SPEAKER_03]: Would big may smoke that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, find a Skittles leaner with nuances
from the Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might go down the fucking throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, find a complete Jack leaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just another Jack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you could, you could cross
whatever you want to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it leans Jack heavy, like 60% or more,
it's like, Hey bro, you just, just like
[SPEAKER_00]: any other strain, another GMO,
another Jack, another fucking this,
[SPEAKER_00]: like there's strains that have been coined
and go find something new, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you haven't found a Skittles cross that
you don't like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found Skittles batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I don't like, like the way it was
grown and processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never necessarily the, uh,
the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause, cause keep in mind quality,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke quality and it's like,
there's some flavors I'd rather not smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: but quality Skittles and most hybrid forms
they check out.
Fuck.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got to touch on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of people are wanting to hear
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the controversy behind big Mace,
uh, what do you refer to yourself as?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you consider yourself a breeder or are
you just doing Mace thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: When, when, uh, when, when dudes call
themselves breeders and, and I,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel like, you know, I'm very
confident and, and, and where I put
[SPEAKER_00]: myself, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see a lot of like, even to this day,
like COVID fucking breeders and COVID
[SPEAKER_00]: growers and no disrespect, but it's like,
I've never seen you motherfuckers outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and, and, and yeah, you might be
inside, but it's like a lot of echo
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber shit going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and, and, and I just see myself
as me, but if I have to put on my breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: hat and be like, Hey man, fuck you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I do the same shit you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you call yourself a fucking
breeder, well fuck, I guess I'm one too
[SPEAKER_00]: motherfucker, you know, but whatever you
want to call me, but make sure fucking put
[SPEAKER_00]: the big on front of it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just
[SPEAKER_02]: a good answer, good answer, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so let's talk about your breeding
practices a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, how do you go?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you've got a whole book,
by the way, guys, go check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you still have that available?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I got, I got all that stuff
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all I got the breeding book,
selection guide, the pollination guide,
[SPEAKER_00]: all shout out green pine logo trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a concept that, uh, he's an artist
and a fucking teacher out in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a college professor of some sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: He teaches art and, uh, he does,
uh, some logos for some of the guys in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I reached out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Hey man, put this shit on
paper for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause, uh, you know, it's, it's something
that feels right for, for, for the people,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, no one has done this before or,
and if they have, you know, fuck,
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to do it too, you know,
I don't think anybody's done it the way
[SPEAKER_03]: that you did.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty damn cool that you used your
influence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause obviously, you know, you're,
you've still got that same vibe.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got the Pokemon, the fucking Yu-Gi-Oh,
like I think it's dope, man, because I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: into that shit too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not so much the Yu-Gi-Oh, I saw you
playing that earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never really gotten that, but like
Pokemon, like some of the old cards from
[SPEAKER_03]: back then, fuck yeah, dude, that shit was
cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: We never really played the games back
then.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more about collecting cards,
but it was still fucking fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, even the fucking game boy games
and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my jam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's the vibe I grew up with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so that you took that influence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And brought it to cannabis for a breeding
guide and like made a comic book thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked that vibe a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was something that, you know,
people had done, but not necessarily in
[SPEAKER_03]: the way that you did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You definitely brought your whole fucking
new thing to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go check that out guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do want to learn more about,
uh, Masonic's breeding practices,
[SPEAKER_03]: selection guide, all of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I know a lot of people know you for
your Wilson male.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we were talking about earlier,
you got something proven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you definitely want to hit that on
some proven females.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you've got proven lines on both
that, you know, what you kind of expect
[SPEAKER_03]: from each one, uh, that, I mean,
there's not really much margin for error,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, uh, what, what, what would you
say is now current Masonic seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you say is your breeding
practice?
[SPEAKER_03]: You say you do pick out a lot of females
and you kind of try to pack as much space
[SPEAKER_03]: as you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it all Wilson still?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you doing multiple males?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I've, I've spread out my tentacles
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it used to be solely Wilson hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, all I did is Wilson, I'll do a couple
of side missions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd pick a male from any given seed pack
that I popped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I deemed it special or worthy,
I'd reach out to X people and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yo, go make some seeds, you know,
give me half a the end and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: call it a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whoever did that, you know,
all power to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so I've done a couple of hybrids
besides the Wilson lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as time started to unravel,
uh, I just, I have a whole different
[SPEAKER_00]: thought process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as of last year, I, uh, I just let the
males go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're just, we're just making seeds
now, like, uh, in, in, in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so I'd like, we pop X amount of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're scratching our chin, thinking about
what male we're going to breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, we'll just leave them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just leave them all, just leave them all,
but just leave them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: People grow them just like any other pack
of seeds, get great weed onto the next
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And are we talking about multiple males
from the same line?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like almost like an OP or different lines,
different lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, so if I get a pack of,
of like a papaya cross from you,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be a papaya, this papaya,
that papaya cross to, if like,
[SPEAKER_00]: if, you know, all these males are,
Hey man, just grow some fucking seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, grow some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bought seeds from this guy,
grow them like, Oh, you want a vision?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well then buy the fucking Wilson one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's by the Wilson fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you want, you want F2, F3,
they're sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you want, you want, you want bat
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a few bat crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like, that's my, my rhetoric.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all like, we, we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing this now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, this now is like, a lot of
people are like scratching their heads,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, but why, but why go smoke some weed
and then come and tell me, but why come
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke with me, come like, come,
come and, and, and like, there isn't a
[SPEAKER_00]: wizard of Oz shit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just come to Oz or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just see what we're doing here,
you know, and, and, and very confident in
[SPEAKER_00]: my craft to the point where I bring
fucking, you know, the who's who's
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders around and show them my dick,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean that in the sense of like
chunk, come check out my grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at my grow, look how clean I keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look how cool it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, damn, you're like a
crazy person, but I know exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, yeah, fuck.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have much respect for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I told these guys before that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, you know, no matter what kind
of controversies around big Mace,
[SPEAKER_03]: he doesn't fucking sugarcoat shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just tells us exactly how he's doing
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no back like back door fucking
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want it or not, you know, I,
and for the people that are talking shit
[SPEAKER_03]: on you, you know, fuck them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: No one, no one above you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one that's like, sometimes like they,
they get in their moods and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: why am I in your fucking mouth guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or why do I even think that you're talking
about?
[SPEAKER_02]: You really know me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I send you so much?
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember like a, I want to say like four
years ago when I was doing my first Wilson
[SPEAKER_00]: blast, one of my first Wilson blast,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just hit it to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like counting my eggs before they
hatched and I posted a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yo, check it out guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Future cross is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I literally posted all the seeds that
I popped cross to Wilson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was like jungle boys or
Capulet or they like, they post and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just like, look at this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, look at me now.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are like, yo, I'm like,
I don't, they're sold out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have different categories of your
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got the FEMS, you got the back
crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: F2, F3 are sold out.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you're doing this kind of thing
with all the different males.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there different prices that reflect
those different categories or is
[SPEAKER_03]: everything about the same?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm still doing single male
pollinations in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we get like three, four seasons
over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I'll do, I did a honey banana
Wilson.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my other stud that I created the
Willy B.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did a line with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a light depth with two tunnels and
just hit a bunch of things with the Willy
[SPEAKER_00]: B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I squeezed that in before the full
term and the full term now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the price points reflect on the
scarcity of said pack, but I don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: I never liked to reach like 80 is where
I'm like, all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could both leave happy for untested
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll throw in some pork barrel
where we're like, you get an extra pack
[SPEAKER_00]: and some, or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I totally believe in that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, or, or everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, fuck, you make a million seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, I'm not, you know, trying to make
a million dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, I want to get by and make some,
I'll, I'll meet you guys somewhere around
[SPEAKER_00]: 25, 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll make some bundle sets where
it'll incentivize the cell where instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of like them spending 25 or to 30 on a
pack, they'll come with four packs and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll level out to 15 to 20 a pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's like, like I'm the,
I'm the breeder and the seller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to find ways to incentivize and
put my product that I stand behind in
[SPEAKER_00]: people's hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and it's, and it's, and it's a,
you know, it's, and, and, and I,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know like, it's like driving the masses
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm just like pulling T sometimes on
trying to like explain to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'm the man, I'm the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look guys, first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just like, this guy's crazy,
but Hey man, fucking you gotta be crazy to
[SPEAKER_00]: do what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a little bit of price
difference, but.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing crazy, especially with today,
you know, with people that are working
[SPEAKER_03]: lines constantly and they're selling their
shit, but we all know who like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I'm going to shout out names.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's motherfuckers out there with the
$500,000, $5,000 packs, $10,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking God damn ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're saying this is exactly what
I'm making.
[SPEAKER_03]: Price reflects that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I fucking mass respect to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I know everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wanted me to bring it up base.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you hate white people, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Drunk mace hated white people that one
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and that, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's just, uh, uh, you know,
growing up as, as, as like a Mexican in
[SPEAKER_00]: south central LA and not understanding
white people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the, that's like my abridged,
uh, version and, and like they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't grow up around any of them and,
and it was a easy target that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and I went for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's why people, by the way,
I, I, I love white people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a half brother who's white and I
love him dearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and I do business with white
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my demographic, they're white as
they come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I, and I respect them and I know
them on the name to name basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I hope that they know that I
don't hate them because I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just, I was at a low point in my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, drinking a lot every single night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, I lashed out and somewhere
deep inside me, I convinced myself that I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't like white people that day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we talked about that before.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's plenty of people here,
uh, that definitely found solace with
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, quit drinking with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You yourself quit drinking with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I've said plenty of fucking dumb
shit being drunk back in the day,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's exactly why I don't drink
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and you yourself, you quit drinking
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long has it been now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going on a little bit over three
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ironically, the day I went to visit
Cap's shop today, that's the day I stopped
[SPEAKER_00]: drinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I was on top of the world,
lost in the sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yo, Cap invited me to go, you know,
parlay with him at his, at his C drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some dude gives me a talk hand with the
fucking devil imprinted on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go home that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get hammered and, and start fucking off
the whole world on, on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, that happened August 23rd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three years ago and, and, and fucking
that's how long it's been.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been three years and a couple of days
that I just, I don't drink no more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be a thing where it's all like,
Hey, you stop here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's grab a six pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's grab a 12 pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a drink every night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like some days it'll be like,
Oh, I'm fucking throwing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sick to my stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a, I'm a slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to drink for a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then back on the fucking train and I'd
be blackout drunk, engaging with my
[SPEAKER_00]: customers, selling seeds, playing call of
duty, get in first place, fucking in a
[SPEAKER_00]: lobby full of Instagram patrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I just thought it was normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one night I drank the wrong beer
with the fucking devil on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the devil came up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what we're going with?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that fucking that brand of beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that brand of beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and yeah, man, that was the last
day I drank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the best thing that ever happened
to me shortly after I stopped drinking,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of dope things happened in my life
and I'm in full control of my life now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just kind of have to reflect
on the outside look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I looked at it was all on,
it was all on record.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's videos of it, you know,
some haters over there holding onto it for
[SPEAKER_00]: dear life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I seen it all over the internet
plastered and I told my constituents,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I made a social contract with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'm not going to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stop drinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very, I'm a shameful guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm a man of my word.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stopped drinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's, it's, that's how easy it
was hard, but that's how easy it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I made a social commitment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I did it for my family,
but I also did it for the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: helped me maintain my family, which is my
constituency, all my followers,
[SPEAKER_00]: all my people that buy my seeds and
support the brand, taking care of your
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ain't nothing better than that,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see you guys going off in the comments,
telling you guys and congratulations,
[SPEAKER_03]: Mace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: All you guys, I got nothing against
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily I can control it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're at a point.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was definitely a point where I
couldn't, but now I can drink like a
[SPEAKER_03]: Scotch, you know, every few months or
whatever, just for the flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it stops there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like, there was a point where I was
going to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about old jobs earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a point where I was going to
work and just fucking throwing up all over
[SPEAKER_03]: the fucking floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, back then it was like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You come to work and you're going to drink
like a fucking man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're going to work like a
fucking man now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tricked myself into making it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'd read dumb shit, like,
Oh, these guys drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I drink too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like them or, or, or I don't drink in
the morning or, or, or like I don't drink
[SPEAKER_03]: before noon.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah, tell yourself,
boy, you know, tell yourself whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I just had to stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of those things, man, they just
become self-destructive behavior,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'm glad to know that you don't hate
half of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that's nice to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right guys, I see you popping off
there and the questions we'll get around
[SPEAKER_03]: to that in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, the Sonic, uh, you do a bunch of live
auctions of your seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about you letting things
go, you know, for a price that ain't
[SPEAKER_03]: nobody going to complain about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked up a few packs from you cause I
definitely want to see what your gear is
[SPEAKER_03]: about.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's how I judge breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: They ain't by like what everybody else is
fucking pay attention to everybody in chat
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It ain't about what everybody's saying
about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay about the fucking drama.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find out for yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like let the seed speak for themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there's some people that, uh,
that I just could not support or even care
[SPEAKER_03]: to try their beans, but you are not one of
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are mainly the people that,
you know, talk about burning their plants
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking holocaust style.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, that happened guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I don't even think I'm going to
release that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll release it as bonus content for
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Podcast gone wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we'll call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some shit you just can't save or don't be
like bragging about shooting people's
[SPEAKER_03]: houses up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I ain't trying to get involved with
all that, you know, you know, miss me with
[SPEAKER_00]: any type of drama.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to be, I wrote the book on that
shit, you know, back in the day I used to,
[SPEAKER_00]: who, who wants to, you know, meme cannons
pointed your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I can't do that shit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm getting too old.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ain't got time for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're working on your success.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like you said, ain't nobody going to
be bitching at you from the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So desert Island question here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Top three strains for the rest of your
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ain't got nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm gonna need some, I need one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope I got this one right,
but maybe I'll take a papaya with me just
[SPEAKER_00]: for, for, for, for, for fruit sake,
you know, switch it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I has got some good flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a certain OG or is it like
original fucking give me SFV.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, SFV.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So taco, I'm going to shorten the fuck out
of your question here, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's try to keep it to like one sense
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever had any, this like another
show that we do too.
[SPEAKER_03]: We like doing conspiracies theories and
like getting all fucking high and just
[SPEAKER_03]: like wondering, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever had like any supernatural
experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: One time me and my wife were driving and
we seen like an object and then it left.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's as close as it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's his, and right when I wanted to
take a picture of the random object in the
[SPEAKER_00]: air, as soon as we passed the freeway
underpass, it disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this happened on our trip to in
December when we went to Fresno,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and I'm just like, there's so
much alien shit that happens nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just like, whatever, I guess,
I guess they're here, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'm not even going to go on Instagram
and tell nobody, but like, that's the only
[SPEAKER_00]: time it's happened and happened this,
this year that passed in December.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's as close as like I've had to,
weird shit around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been like a fucking plan or
something, but to me that looked like a
[SPEAKER_00]: very still object and then it disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just went on our merry way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's as close as I've been to some
freaky shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No ghosts, no paranormal shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, I've had, I've had dudes come in my
house like real guns, not ghost though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just cut that part out right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah, that's not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ty, all right Tycho, I got you homie.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when the aliens finally show up,
do you think they have their own version
[SPEAKER_03]: of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you think it's like here where the
aliens have the cannabis culture and they
[SPEAKER_03]: have pictures of humans on the dye
tapestries?
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck kind of question is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn, big dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a long one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think they'll have their own
version of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah, let's just go with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they'll be beyond cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they'll be here for, you know,
other purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cannabis is probably beyond them
and shit, if they're cannabis enthusiasts,
[SPEAKER_00]: well fuck, we're on top of the world,
big dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're good then, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless they fucking phylos our ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man, straight up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dang Panda wants to know what's your
favorite plant that you've lost?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've come across like some elite
strains that I, I've never been one to
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, we got this and, you know,
keep cloning it and keep it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, cool, we got this nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's a nice tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, that's a nice cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as time goes by, you're like,
oh, like that was a pretty nice cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't like asking people for
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then now it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and that's, that's an
inconvenience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a lot of cuts, right, that I've
come across that just kind of left like B
[SPEAKER_00]: whiz 32 fucking, you know, real animal
man's real, real Cushman's rabbit hippie
[SPEAKER_00]: and just like everything that's come
across and it's not that I lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of like, how much space
I have and the creativity that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: pursuing and, and I'm a seed popper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we could do motor breath and papaya
and the whole fucking elite catalog every
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking time to a new male.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm looking for brand spanking
unscathed new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that usually requires a seed pop and,
and coining Terps that have not been
[SPEAKER_00]: coined and looking in places that aren't
elite clones and going to fucking Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: and Europe and fucking land race varieties
from any given seed company and just
[SPEAKER_00]: looking under stones that aren't those
elites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I feel bad when I lost every
clone I've lost to this day, but it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: cause I lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just cause that's just how things
had to be because of my space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not one to be like, my,
my greenhouse will be full with just that
[SPEAKER_00]: catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I need to do seed pops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, cause that's how I look at stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if, if, Hey man, if it gets lost,
fuck it, man, you know, just make sure the
[SPEAKER_00]: Wilson mail is always around and we're
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the one that you just can't
lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I just can't lose, but like in
this unwritten book of bullshit,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will be, it will feel good in 10 years,
20 years to now.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be like, yo, I got my same male bitch,
you know, like, what do you got?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, Oh, you don't got your
male that shoots everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's whack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's just like, that's how I
look at things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how it kind of, I was taught,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you were taught to go hunt a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I stepped on the scene from the
people that I looked up to, you go hunt a
[SPEAKER_00]: male and you build a line and you keep
your male around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you could cross it back to the
male and just, just do true breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I looked at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I kept my male around
because, you know, that's, that's part of
[SPEAKER_00]: my legacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking about males, big bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: John wants to know male selections.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you look for?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so like when you're making a cross,
you're making a cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're basing it on structure,
all power to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't base my plants on structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of a given, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like hopefully it has enough structure
most of the time they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool and all structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Structure's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biomass is fine, but flavor, turps,
that's what we're after.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're trying to make a hybrid of,
for me, for instance, I'm trying to make
[SPEAKER_00]: shish kebari hybrids and honey banana
hybrids and, and head banger hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first thing I would do is to grab those
tools and I would go grab head banger
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, shish kebari seeds, X, X seeds,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow those out visually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will grow better than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of them will start to like,
males, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Visually you start to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a run.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're left.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pop 12 seeds, you left,
you got six seeds, two of them suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're left with four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then kind of, you know, start stem
rubbing, start look at the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you flowered out the females,
you kind of notice like if there's two
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to lean, like I'll give you an
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barber's pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pop a regular pack of barbers pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them lean towards the train wreck
shit, which is not my selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's not something I would want to
encapsulate and sell to you knowingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yo, not knowingly, but I mean it in
the sense like, I'm not going to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: train wreck to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will sell train wreck to you,
but I'm going to tell you it's train
[SPEAKER_00]: wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So barbers pie, you're growing your
barbers pies or whatever fucking selection
[SPEAKER_00]: you're aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and you allude the, this is just a
way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You allude that stem rub from that female
leaning, you know, fucking Fino or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you kind of go look for that in the
males, but you got to keep in mind when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing selection, you're alluding to
your bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your bar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your bar is your experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your experience is how many seeds you
physically, tangibly grown yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like your selection is this most of the
time, cause a lot of people have popped,
[SPEAKER_00]: let alone seen that many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not saying that you haven't, but that was
my process going through the ringer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, Oh, as I went by, now I know
what bandaid haze is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know what a five is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know what C four is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know what dose he is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know what all these things are
because I grew them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all part of your selection
process is like what you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just kind of narrowing it down and
finding that flavor and making hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to ask you this really quick before
we get back to you guys as questions,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, because we talked about this not too
long ago, you seem pretty on par with
[SPEAKER_03]: about what I do too.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about some of the people
that are like some of the runs or some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the best ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might have some of the terpiest shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, no, no, not that it's not my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like sometimes you find Terps that you
won't find in a big plant and on a small
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, look at skittles and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we did the blue Magoo back cross
twice, uh, I did a big old hunt of that,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I didn't know at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't really didn't have to do that big
of a hunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but we did a big old hunt of that and
we had some runs and I did keep them just
[SPEAKER_03]: cause we had the space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and they were fucking crazy frosty and
they were fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually kept the clone off the one,
uh, but like selection breeding wise that
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't be my shit because I'm after that
vigor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's a big deal for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the Terps, the fucking high are on
point and it's a vigorous bitch,
[SPEAKER_03]: like that's what I would want to breed
with, you know, and I'll fucking take that
[SPEAKER_03]: amount and pull that down to like,
what's the best of that fits that
[SPEAKER_03]: description.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be my, that's going to be
my shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So steel says, I heard about Masonic from
a pack of chili Riano chili Verde cost
[SPEAKER_03]: with Wilson.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything else you have with the
chili Verde?
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have my Chile Verde seed stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I never revisited the Chile Verde
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a kind of just, I did what I had to
do with that and I don't see me revisiting
[SPEAKER_00]: that line until maybe later on in life
where I run out of Chile Verde seed stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might pop some more of my Chile Verde
Wilson, find a nice Chile Verde leaner and
[SPEAKER_00]: some other stuff and just repopulate those
lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good question, Dan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for bringing this up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even think about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, where'd the name Wilson come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Wilson is a cross between a string
called Castaway and Tropicana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Castaway is Banana OG Papaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so it was a play on words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I, I didn't name Wilson, Oni named
Wilson when I made the strains for Oni.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's how it's easier to sell seeds
when they have a fucking name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they named them and, uh, I just kind of
stuck with it and it turned into a life of
[SPEAKER_00]: its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad they fucking called it Wilson
because Wilson is super fucking like
[SPEAKER_00]: culturally relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I turn on the TV, the name
Wilson's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I open a book, there's
something about Wilson, fucking Tom Hanks,
[SPEAKER_00]: this fucking, uh, Forrest Gump dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always like this proximity that
always ties back to the greatness behind
[SPEAKER_00]: the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, it just, the universe blessed me
with the dope, uh, flagship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strain name for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Dank Panda wants to know favorite
cross that you've ever created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe Wilson, uh, as, as time has gone
by Wilson itself as, as like the F1 or
[SPEAKER_00]: like any of the generations of the hybrids
of it, it's, it's special in its own way
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's not another regurgitation of the
strains that were used to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not necessarily another Papaya or
another Tropicana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's its own tropical mix that has stood
the test of time since like 2017 till
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is like, yeah, like I did this cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm proud of this train because it's
not just something someone else did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a, it's a breath of fresh air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I'm very proud of the Wilson and
what I've done with it for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Tucker wants to know, is there a cross
that you would love to make?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm working on all that stuff right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all the stuff I love to make is all
kind of happening right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's, uh, people always ask me
like, wouldn't you like this clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, like, nah, there's no end all be
all for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, I've gotten to the point in my life
where if I see something that I really
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I can go grab it or reach out and,
uh, everything that I want right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'm very confident in, in what I
learned and, and, and, and, and that I
[SPEAKER_00]: push on you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, everything that I,
that like I'm wishing for, like I got the
[SPEAKER_00]: tools to do it and I'm already doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taco says, I like the chicken in your
logo.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the story?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a, I have a chickens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I raised chickens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I raised chickens for a little over 10
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got so many chickens at my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get eggs and they're like pets and they
give us eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they fertilize a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do their job.
[SPEAKER_03]: They fertilize and then use them kind of
like, it's part of your IPM, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they, there ain't no slugs at that
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I ain't got no snails or nothing
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm, as far as critters on the
ground, we're pretty clean, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fucking clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice IPM.
[SPEAKER_03]: We always had chickens growing up too,
but yeah, never did have them around my
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking weed plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I think we'd use some of the chicken
shit to grow with and everything,
[SPEAKER_03]: but never just had them like free roaming
around the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing like some of your pictures of your
growing shit and they're just like
[SPEAKER_03]: wandering around fucking feeding them and
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty smart too.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, where can people find you,
man?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if somebody wants to look up,
like what's Masonics, let's see some of
[SPEAKER_03]: his plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're going to find you on IG.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got anything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got my Instagram Masonic Smoker 4.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: That more is like a lifestyle page where I
kind of just post like stuff that I'm into
[SPEAKER_00]: my family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got my backup page,
which is the Masonic underscore smoker 20
[SPEAKER_00]: 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see me showcase some of my
growing talent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And besides that, man, that's,
that's, you know, I got my YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to look through some old
videos that I've done and I had,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a podcast that's on hiatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be launching back a little bit
sooner than later on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, YouTube and Instagram is kind of
where you'll find keeping up with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I got my website, but we just
sell shit on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't necessarily post blogs or nothing
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that where people get seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to Masonic seeds.co.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you fucking go look through
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a never ending list of selections
there for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go hit it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you do some like live auctions and
shit on your Instagram live sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not auctions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like to engage with my crowd and do
like a fucking I'll incentivize a sell,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you know, buy this pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might win this pack type of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you never know what shenanigans I'm up
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always doing some Billy Mays shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, and he wouldn't make that reference
if he had white people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Billy Mays is not white as it gets.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, for real, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, go check him out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked up like three packs from Big Nays
the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three packs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I paid 60 bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can kind of see what's going on with
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some fire shit in there like the L
.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kush cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some pie shit like I'm stoked,
dude, because I love the papaya,
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to work with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The flavor on the papaya is probably one
of my favorite fruit flavors and feed of
[SPEAKER_03]: all time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only thing I never liked about the papaya
that I'd like to improve for me is that
[SPEAKER_03]: shit knocks me the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could smoke that shit first thing in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be tired like I'm going to want to
take a nap afterwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like everything else about it,
the flavor, the yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love getting ripped, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love getting ripped.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any flavor as long as it's good and it's
not train wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not train wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mays, thank you so much for taking time
out of your day to come talk to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of fucking reiterate some of that
bullshit that's going on in the community
[SPEAKER_03]: with the talk and the fucking haters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for coming on here speaking your
real.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate it and I'm looking
forward to going through your seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to get you on.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you got time again, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll hit you up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're doing a game show on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you'd like to help me host that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun as fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like an hour of people just dab and
constantly like doing hand stands and
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking one gram dabs and all kinds of
crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we give away some things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're interested in doing that,
we'll have you on then.
[SPEAKER_03]: But go check him out.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sonic feeds dot co.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, big dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next time.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been the podcast saying good
night.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be right.

[SPEAKER_04]: said, baby.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweetheart.
[SPEAKER_04]: They said.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we got what you need,
baby.
