[SPEAKER_05]: What's up everybody and welcome to a brand
new episode of the Calix and crew podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm your host as always Doc Calix and I've
got two very special people with me today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got Janelle and Corey LaPlante of
Tastefully Baked.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you guys doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the way from Portland, Maine.
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys make art in edible form.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They sent us a bunch of stuff to try that
we will be trying out during the episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: But before we get into all that,
we want to know a little bit more about
[SPEAKER_05]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you tell us how you first,
each individually, because I'm sure it was
[SPEAKER_05]: a different story, but each individually,
how you guys first got introduced to
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so basically I started in high
school to replace my Adderall like a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of my friends did just to trade it for
weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, basically self-medicate mainly
because everybody didn't want me to and it
[SPEAKER_06]: helped, made me hungry.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, from there I went off and learned
how to weld and hated it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So then I decided to go surf in Hawaii and
figure out what I was going to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Met a guy who actually was up your way,
you know, grown in a warehouse and ended
[SPEAKER_06]: up getting out of it and moved to Hawaii
and sold all his stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he kind of, you know, planted the seed
in my head.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ended up going back east, you know,
trying to figure out how to grow,
[SPEAKER_06]: ran into, you know, a couple of people at
North Carolina mountains that,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, really taught me some things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of what I came into your
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never consumed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a completely foreign concept really
to me at that point in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was what, like 19?
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I went down for a trip to visit
him because we had started dating at the
[SPEAKER_02]: time and I was still living in New
Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it kind of just was I'm trying
to even like think of how I even want to
[SPEAKER_02]: describe it, but it was just kind of went
down there and he had something that he
[SPEAKER_02]: had to tell me before I kind of went into
the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: She had no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea about any of this.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you like fly down,
spend a whole day and then all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_02]: you get there and he's just like,
so before you go into my house,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's something I think you should know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, OK, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, well, I have some, you know,
some plants upstairs in the, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the spare bedroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, OK, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'd say that was probably my
first time ever consuming weed was during
[SPEAKER_02]: that trip down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hit up basically every grocery store
that had the three little samples for you
[SPEAKER_02]: to go ahead and grab food.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what was your first experience with?
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you guys just smoke a joint or?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we were smoking bongs,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was bongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberry cross, if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that got me the cut of that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Crawdad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you were replacing your Adderall with
it, you didn't like how the Adderall was
[SPEAKER_05]: treating you and you were getting more
relief with the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I basically just took my took my
appetite and stuff away and I was super
[SPEAKER_06]: skinny.
[SPEAKER_06]: I weighed like one hundred and fifteen
pounds when I graduated high school and
[SPEAKER_06]: didn't, you know, I just couldn't stand
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hated the way it made me feel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hated coming down off it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, I started just smoking weed and
everybody's like, oh, he's doing great.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wasn't taking my medicine and.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, it obviously worked for you,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: How did that growing for yourself growing
at your house, you guys meeting and how
[SPEAKER_05]: would that turn into tastefully baked?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where'd the idea for tastefully baked come
from?
[SPEAKER_06]: The idea for tastefully baked came from
when we ended up in New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_06]: We moved to Maine after we got in a little
bit of trouble in New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, yeah, we kind of needed
something to call our creations.
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew we wanted to get back into
cannabis after the ordeal that we went
[SPEAKER_02]: through in New Hampshire was more so just
trying to figure out like logistically how
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to make that move,
make that jump.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's cover that really quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened over in New Hampshire for
everybody that doesn't know?
[SPEAKER_02]: In what, 2000?
[SPEAKER_06]: It was 2013.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2013.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were indicted on a bunch of charges for
cultivating and but they distribute to
[SPEAKER_02]: distribute cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were raided by the drug task force,
went through the whole entire ordeal that
[SPEAKER_02]: is New Hampshire is very strict.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was prosecuted.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was it was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was all over the papers, all the news.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, going to court every week.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had high bail and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were basically looking at spending
the rest of our adult lives in state
[SPEAKER_06]: prison and then go into federal prison for
some guns that we had at the house on
[SPEAKER_06]: weapons charges after that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was either fight the whole thing or
take a plea and just, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: take 10 years and go take a long trip
away.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we decided to fight it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, got a really good attorney and
we ended up proving that they lied to the
[SPEAKER_06]: judge.
[SPEAKER_06]: To get the search warrant, which made them
have to throw out all the evidence.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it took about a year to fight quite a
bit of stress.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a lot of money, lots of money,
lots of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worth every penny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Judicial system.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we had to cancel our wedding.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was it was it was hard on our families.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was probably the hardest thing was
putting my mom and dad through it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was her family.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the hardest part.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, we learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: We really want to do that again.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we figured out, you know, we're going
to go do it the right way.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's as best as you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't upset the mother-in-law.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got the DEA.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the mother-in-law.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys went from your indictment
there and fighting that into going up to
[SPEAKER_05]: Portland, Maine, creating Tastefully
Baked.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys have a lot more products
than what you sent me, but I just want to
[SPEAKER_05]: show them off to people really quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe I believe Janelle's drinking
one, too, right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have these amazing juice infused
infusions.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're 50 milligrams apiece.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys go about infusing a drink
like that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been wanting to talk to an Edibles
expert for a very long time about this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had infused seltzers before,
but coming from a home-grown perspective
[SPEAKER_05]: where we make a lot of cookies and
brownies and gummies and like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, simple to make stuff at home,
the concept of infused seltzer is
[SPEAKER_05]: something I can't even fathom.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you guys go about that process?
[SPEAKER_02]: So for like background, our company,
we do cultivation, we do extraction,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we also obviously make our own
cannabis infused products.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like to have hands kind of into
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: That goes into our products so we can make
sure that everything is up to our caliber.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really all starts obviously in the
garden and then it heads over to my
[SPEAKER_02]: husband and he does the extraction.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, basically for the seltzers,
we do we take like a full spectrum extract
[SPEAKER_06]: and then we strip everything out of it
except for the THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we basically do like a full
chromatography column scrub on it and take
[SPEAKER_06]: it so it's completely flavorless.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we homogenize it at a really,
really, really high RPM.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a certain, I guess I would
say a certain recipe that I figured out
[SPEAKER_02]: over the past, probably what, just
probably nine months of, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: nine months R&D research to try and create
something that would be water soluble.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was that whole backend and then
kind of once I figured out the recipe for
[SPEAKER_02]: it, we just kind of ran with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main reason why we personally have
decided to take out basically everything
[SPEAKER_02]: that could taste like vegetative growth or
any sort of flavor that resembles that of
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis plant is just I personally
don't like to consume edibles that taste
[SPEAKER_02]: like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I wanted that, then I would have like a
juice or something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is for more so for the palate
that doesn't want it to taste like
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it depends.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's some things that it pairs
well with and then there's a lot of things
[SPEAKER_05]: that it just tastes like weedy on top of
whatever you got.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a time and place I think for
everything from my personal perspective of
[SPEAKER_02]: just doing edibles and food infusions over
the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're saying after you extract all the
THC, that in itself is water soluble?
[SPEAKER_06]: The THC is not.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to break it down basically into
nanoparticles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then yeah, then you mix it with a
carrier and you basically have to
[SPEAKER_06]: homogenize it into an intermediary liquid
that gets mixed into the bright tank,
[SPEAKER_06]: basically a brewery style tank,
like a big tank.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it gets carbonated, goes through the
can every can and then it has to go back
[SPEAKER_06]: to the lab for lab testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I mentioned earlier, you guys have
the passion orange guava and you sent me a
[SPEAKER_05]: lemonade too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the only two flavors or is there
more than that?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have sour blue rasp as well and a
tropical punch and then we have something
[SPEAKER_02]: else we're kind of working on behind the
scenes that will hopefully be ready in the
[SPEAKER_02]: next three to six months.
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn, you guys hear that?
[SPEAKER_05]: All new flavors coming out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You said blue raspberry and now yeah,
I think I got to put it in.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to make a main trip here pretty
soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a beautiful place to come to in the
fall.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys want to, you guys can go over
to their IG, it's tastefullybaked at
[SPEAKER_05]: tastefullybaked on IG.
[SPEAKER_02]: At tastefullybaked2.0.
[SPEAKER_05]: At tastefullybaked2.0.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see videos of them actually
creating some of these things,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they have, and I'm going to fuck up
the saying again, calamansi cheesecake
[SPEAKER_05]: confection bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we do right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, yeah, that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are a hundred milligrams a
piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a QR code on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I hit that QR code, what's going to pop
up?
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll take you to the website and then
if you scroll down towards the bottom of
[SPEAKER_02]: the website, we have a certificate of
analysis for that particular product.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to know where you guys' dose
is.
[SPEAKER_05]: A hundred milligrams is like, I don't know
if I don't do enough edibles, but that's a
[SPEAKER_05]: top for me and I smoke all day every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: But a hundred milligrams really gets me
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are you guys at?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm about 50.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll generally split one of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's relatively rich, so we'll generally
split it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, our market here as far as
edibles and infusions is very high dose.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I was going to get into with
that bar.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of these, what goes into making this?
[SPEAKER_05]: How much time does it actually take to
make a calamansi cheesecake bar?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are definitely a labor of love.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more so a passion project at the end
of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do them because I really just enjoy
trying to create a flavorful experience
[SPEAKER_02]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that consists of three different
layers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first layer that you have is the
calamansi patafui.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a calamansi is a mixture of between
like an orange and a lime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're predominantly grown in like
really tropical climates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the Philippines is a very common
place where you can find them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to make that layer,
lay it all out, let it sit overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the following day you need to frame
out your next layer to put on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for this one is a white chocolate
cheesecake ganache, which is absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you throw that on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you need to wait again for the
following day basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I finished it off with a graham
cracker cheesecake.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most of the ingredients that we source
to, I try and find either anything local.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as local agriculture, we have a lot
of local dairy farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Local organic is really where our focus is
at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the chocolate that we use is sourced
from companies that don't use child slave
[SPEAKER_02]: labor for their cacao harvesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you go down that rabbit hole,
it really wants to make you stay straight
[SPEAKER_02]: on your morals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you start learning all the nitty
gritty about the chocolate industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really also kind of our thought
process behind everything that we try and
[SPEAKER_02]: create.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try and be conscious of the various
places that we source our ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have to wait till the following
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to making this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then the following day is when we end
up actually cutting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we let it again sit out until the
following day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets an enrobed, drizzled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we need to wait for the test
results to come in for us to package it up
[SPEAKER_02]: and have it sent over to the patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is everything on that bar infused or is
it a simple part of it that is not?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have figured out more so which parts of
the recipe are easier for me to infuse to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep the dose accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Easiest way to keep the dosage accurate
throughout everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on that bar in particular, it's the
calamansi petri-flea that's infused.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which some people, I found out,
who are gluten intolerant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, okay, I'll just have as long
as I know the pieces that I'm eating that
[SPEAKER_02]: are infused, I'll just leave out the
graham cracker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of funny too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this thing is a hundred gram chocolate
bar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Says milk chocolate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fifteen hundred milligrams per bar.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is ridiculous guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of our demographic too is also,
you know, the health conscious part that
[SPEAKER_02]: once a high dose, but doesn't want to
consume a bunch of sugar and a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you have the people with a very high
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are kind of like, you know,
the two patients that where we have in
[SPEAKER_02]: mind when we create something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've just, you know, when I get into a
chocolate bar, I'm not going to stop at
[SPEAKER_05]: the first couple of bites.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like that for me would be an all in
or all out thing, but 1500 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I could do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we should definitely ask him about
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Panda says I'm at over 9,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and I've heard about this before.
[SPEAKER_05]: People that don't process edibles the same
way that other people do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that something that you guys have
experienced?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not personally, but with various,
you know, stories from patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard from a lot, you know,
a lot of people who are super heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrate consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoke flour all day long.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have five milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like no way.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, and that's the thing I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will dab and you know, flour all day
type of guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate flour more, but I take dabs
more throughout the day just because I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: so busy all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very convenient to be in and out and
done.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we're taking edible and let that
ride out for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But still with that tolerance level,
a hundred milligram drink will just,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the last time I did a hundred
milligram drink, I was on a hay ride about
[SPEAKER_05]: Halloween time and I was just spacing out
on every animal that we went by.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was horrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it wasn't horrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was amazing, but you know, it was
unexpected with your infusions on the
[SPEAKER_05]: chocolate bars.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are these, I've seen some on your page
that you break open.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like caramel filled.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what this is?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is it just strictly a regular chocolate
bar?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is just a solid piece of chocolate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys have a few different options
when it comes to your chocolate bars then?
[SPEAKER_02]: We do a lot of limited kind of releases.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows us to be creative with things
that are in season.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows us to do, you know, stuff out of
the necessary production norms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we get to use, you know, our brains a
little bit more than just trying to be
[SPEAKER_02]: cogs in a, you know, a machine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really engaging and interesting for
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that way they're, we're always
expanding and you know, who knows what
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of flavors you may bring together
that, you know, I gotta say, I think we
[SPEAKER_05]: all really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are sourcing local.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're locally minded.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're very well in tune with what you're
putting into there and how you're doing
[SPEAKER_05]: your dosages.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It shows that you care about your
clientele base for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not eating the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: No way.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will not be able to do the rest of the
episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you what, I am going to take a
bite of this bar though.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to see what tastefully baked is all
about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheers guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was expecting it to be thicker and
harder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Might hit your palate first.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to say what hit first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, that is probably one of the best
edibles I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_05]: No shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: The chocolate kind of coats your tongue
right off the bat just because it's there,
[SPEAKER_05]: but that the citrus just kind of cuts
through all of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally different than anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it all mixes and combines very well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then right at the end, even though you
got the texture of it, the flavor of the
[SPEAKER_05]: graham cracker really like follows
everything up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love cheesecake and that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of this is dangerous.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to wash it down now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to do it with that drink
because I think that bar.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me ask you guys really quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: From the, all the pleasure that you guys
get from doing this, what's your favorite
[SPEAKER_05]: part of it?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the emails from the patients,
honestly, for me personally, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's nothing like opening up,
you know, your inbox, your DMS and having
[SPEAKER_02]: messages from patients that are super
excited either to, you know, wanting to
[SPEAKER_02]: know where to get your stuff or giving you
a compliment about something that you've
[SPEAKER_02]: made.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really, that makes it all worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that we went through in the past
and just the, you know, the stress and the
[SPEAKER_02]: hassle of running a small business.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very over-regulated business.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes it all worth it at the end of
the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: No peer pressure guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I've got shit to do later.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a busy man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is hard to eat just part of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say showing great restraint.
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of all the pieces.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of art that you guys do through your
culinary work, which seems to be the most
[SPEAKER_05]: popular?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like there's our staples,
but then the patients really get excited
[SPEAKER_02]: for whatever new creation we're going to
make next.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're always anticipating that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't kind of have our staples to
keep them occupied while we're over here
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to figure out what we're going to
concoct for like the next tasting
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are constantly creating new
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we get any insight about something
that might be coming up here?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our like confection bar line like
you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've kind of themed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll do like different drops,
different flavor combinations throughout
[SPEAKER_02]: the season, depending upon what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: A Christmas staple for us is like a Bon
Bon five piece variety assortment of
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever we come up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Valentine's Day again for us is like
another huge Bon Bon event because
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone likes to gift each other
chocolate of course for Valentine's Day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we tend to more so stick with like the
certain themed items, but really change up
[SPEAKER_02]: the flavors depending upon either what
inspired us or whatever maybe in season or
[SPEAKER_02]: some sort of holiday flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really varies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would it be fair to say that you guys
favorite consumption method is edibles?
[SPEAKER_06]: I like flour personally.
[SPEAKER_06]: I smoke flour most of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find edibles are a great like nighttime
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're great if you want a wonderful
seamless night's sleep to not be
[SPEAKER_02]: interrupted by anything or anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as for like daytime consumption
for me, flour is where it's at.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely a flour guy too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think most people in chat will agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I see cry dad popping up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just want to hug them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've done so well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely and your packaging is off
the chart guys like it really pops.
[SPEAKER_05]: So and we've talked about this many times
before there's companies that make kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: an inferior product and I'm not gonna say
who cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not gonna say who but they throw it in
a package that pops and it's basically
[SPEAKER_05]: like putting makeup on a pig.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing behind it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you guys have done.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's definitely an incredible product
inside of that case and it's wrapped in a
[SPEAKER_05]: beautiful wrapper.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this something that you guys can
expect.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go over to tastefullybaked.com and
see all their products.
[SPEAKER_05]: What else do you guys have on there?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a staple if you will besides
chocolate bars, drinks and these.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say probably our vape cards would
be our next next in line.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do like offer vape cards.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a cured resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a low ohm more like a nicotine
style vape that like blows a bigger cloud.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a higher voltage type of deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are super popular.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me ask Corey first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Corey, if I had to ask you top three
strains of all time, what would you say?
[SPEAKER_02]: We had this discussion the other day a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of probably number one would
be headband.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably number two would be one that we
just got from the guys over at DNA
[SPEAKER_06]: recently, which is GMO kosher kosh cross.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really almost smells like a skunky kind of
like Thanksgiving dinner.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely had to be into like some weird,
weird turps to like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's one of those things that people
just get really obsessed with once they
[SPEAKER_06]: actually smell it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really kind of a skunky background,
but definitely some Thanksgiving vibes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then maybe like the original guerrilla
I like really gassy stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really offensive kind of turps for me
personally.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm seeing a pattern here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I vibe with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love a little bit of everything,
but I am more into the accurate stuff for
[SPEAKER_05]: sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Janelle, how about you?
[SPEAKER_05]: What would be your top three?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd go cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just, I don't know, to me that's
it's a classic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the perfect kind of go to smoke of
the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I would probably go with,
what do we have LA?
[SPEAKER_02]: LA confidential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, LA woman.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had LA woman way back and that just
took you on an interesting borderline
[SPEAKER_06]: scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Borderline kind of psychedelic kind of
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a really, really good one.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody in chat, would you look up the
lineage on that one really quick?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a LA confidential with,
I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember for the life of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I say, our headband that we had.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how was it psychedelic?
[SPEAKER_02]: It just kind of puts you in this- Made you
really think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different sort of way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even like, your brain was just in
a pulsating, distorting, distorted- And it
[SPEAKER_05]: made your top three though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Martian Mean Green is the other one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Martian Mean Green and LA confidential.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's from DNA genetics again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So are you guys over there in Maine,
are you able to both process and produce?
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys can grow your own medicine for
your own edibles?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're vertically integrated besides sales,
but yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's in the grow room right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now we have, we just popped a bunch
of cheese gorilla glue crosses from Expert
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Lemon Haze.
[SPEAKER_06]: From Greenhouse, the old school one.
[SPEAKER_02]: GMO Kosher.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a Banana OG crossed with Tangy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Double Stuffed Sorbet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Canelope Haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I said Canelope Haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that rounds them out for right-
Oh, and a Cherry Pie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Cherry Pie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there one cultivar that makes it into
your edibles more than others?
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a smaller garden, so we kind of
cycle through strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll run up for a little while and then
we'll kind of, we're always kind of pheno
[SPEAKER_06]: hunting something different and then
always cycling stuff out.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So whatever that run produced,
that's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as we find something better,
we'll retire what isn't quite as good and
[SPEAKER_06]: we'll keep a few going and we'll just kind
of have a competition for real estate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what do you think is the future of
Tastefully Bake?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys have like a 10-year goal?
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you like to see Tastefully Bake
become?
[SPEAKER_05]: How can we progress more from where it is
right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a lot of stuff, so you can have a
vision.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just always a little bit hard to make
it, to know, I guess, how the legal path
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to pave its way over the next 10
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably the most challenging thing
about planning a growth for a cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: business and trying to kind of figure out
how you want to go about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're wanting to expand beyond state
lines, are you going to want to do it in
[SPEAKER_02]: the MSO type method?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to want to do it more in
like a multi-state brand type way?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's super individual for
everyone, depending upon whatever workload
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever they're kind of deciding to
invest.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think really just focusing on
creating things to be, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the future, I see us more so pivoting
towards honestly a greenhouse model than
[SPEAKER_02]: the way that we currently have things set
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, that takes time for a brand to
grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's a lot of old farms.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to grab an old farm and have a
greenhouse and then do some outdoor stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: and kind of have some food production
along with it so we can do a small CSA for
[SPEAKER_06]: our patients and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to incorporate a lot more just
regular agriculture as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really passionate about high quality
food and what we put into our systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people who consume
cannabis are also very conscious of other
[SPEAKER_02]: things and what they consume.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to really kind of tie more of the
philosophy together is what I see us
[SPEAKER_02]: doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really respect that like crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next time I go up there, I'm definitely
going to have to come check you guys out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am a west coaster to a T.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not spent that much time on the
East Coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was over in Boston.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't realize that was like less than
two hours away from me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So next time I'm over that way,
I'll definitely have to meet up with you
[SPEAKER_05]: guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check out what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would definitely love to.
[SPEAKER_05]: You come on very high honors from Kra
Daddy who we've talked about before.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys met over in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think everybody wants to hear about it
because everybody knows Kra Dad and now
[SPEAKER_05]: we're getting to meet you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: How'd you guys get to know each other?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were working at App Ski Mound in the
ski shop together and a mutual friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy that I was talking to about
growing weed was like, hey, if you got any
[SPEAKER_06]: questions, this is the guy to talk to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we struck it up, did some partying
and he gave me a bunch of tips,
[SPEAKER_06]: got some stuff going and we've just been
in touch ever since.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gone down there a couple of times to
visit throughout the years too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kra Dad coming through with the cannabis
help.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a bunch of quick fire questions
here from our Patreon members.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's dig into them really quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fanda says, do you make a Christmas advent
calendar?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a great idea though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fantastic idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have actually had a few patients
request one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I would get one for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be a rough month, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really would.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you have your favorite, the edible
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just eat it before you go to bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little after dinner.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Taco says, what is one of your
favorite edibles that you use but don't
[SPEAKER_05]: sell?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there is any one that we
really, I mean, there's nothing that I
[SPEAKER_02]: ever make that's specifically for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our line, I would say, is kind of our
lifestyle in a sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: We kind of, what we'd like we make and we
won't sell anything that we wouldn't
[SPEAKER_06]: personally want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me ask in this perspective,
is there another company that makes
[SPEAKER_05]: edibles that you're like, I would buy
theirs?
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, she won't eat anybody else's
edibles at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Steel says, how do you feel about edibles
packaging that seems to resemble a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: the candy on the market?
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, the nerds ropes and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, to each their own, do whatever is
on brand for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, for us, that's not our image.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the type of product that we're
trying to put out or portray.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could never put out a nerds rope.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not our style.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as I said, to each their own.
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of regular, just like everyday food,
is there something that we can expect to
[SPEAKER_05]: never have from Tastefully Baked because
you guys don't appreciate it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a type of food that each one of
you just, absolutely, I will not eat that?
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, it's walnuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate walnuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do stay away from nuts in our facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the other big thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have a few patients that I know that
are really sensitive to nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something that I'm conscious of
that a lot of people don't eat certain
[SPEAKER_02]: things because there's edibles that are
produced in a facility that does stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: with nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will say that if I were to draw a
line somewhere on stuff, it would be nuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you just in Maine or are you in other
states of taco?
[SPEAKER_02]: We are just in Maine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just in Maine right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys have a storefront where you
can get edibles to or is everything
[SPEAKER_05]: online?
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything is available.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how it's set up here is we have,
we're the distributor, and we have various
[SPEAKER_02]: other storefronts in which we distribute
our products too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys grow, you process,
and then you have retail stores as well.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: We probably have about 15 partner stores
around the state that sell our products.
[SPEAKER_05]: So other than edibles and vape carts,
is there anything else you guys are
[SPEAKER_05]: producing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we have our flour.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have our rendition of agami,
which is kind of a, I wouldn't say healthy
[SPEAKER_06]: version, but a more conscious version of
candy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you all consider making some agua
fresca flavors, for example, a horchata
[SPEAKER_05]: drink?
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with that one, Steele.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all about the horchata.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will look into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big Bad John says, best home recipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: What would be something that you guys
would recommend for a medical patient?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we use, we infuse a local honey,
and then a lot of people like to make tea
[SPEAKER_06]: with it, which just makes a really good
evening thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple of recipes that I have up
on our website that mainly utilize honey,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think honey is a great universal
ingredient that people can apply to any
[SPEAKER_02]: dish really, and voila, you have a
cannabis infused meal, but there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: really good one up there too, for Brussels
sprouts with our honey and a balsamic
[SPEAKER_02]: glaze drizzle with some toasted pine nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of people don't like Brussels
sprouts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a Brussels sprouts freak.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I love them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pan fried, nice crispiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all about that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys can go over to tastefullybaked
.com and check out these infusions for
[SPEAKER_05]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you infusing the honey?
[SPEAKER_02]: The honey, again, everything that we do is
through a mechanical homogenization.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what it does is it breaks everything
down into really small particles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to make sure that it's evenly
homogenous throughout the entire product.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically like a big metal cutting
head with another cutting head on the
[SPEAKER_06]: inside that spins at like 40,000 RPMs and
just basically smashes everything apart at
[SPEAKER_06]: a molecular level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, to really solubalize it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big Bad John says you guys need to do a
cookbook.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a great idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been another thing that's been on
the, on the back burner for a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I think if there's a,
you know, it's fun to be able to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: take your dosage or whatever into your own
hands and kind of make your own things at
[SPEAKER_02]: home that you can serve for guests.
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely have some patients that do
that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll come back and then they'll tell
us what they made with, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of our ingredients.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will give you guys a good review after
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm already, it's starting to hit me right
now if you can't tell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very light body floating feeling.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too intense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely worth it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think I'm not going to eat the other
half of that yet because I do got to drive
[SPEAKER_05]: later.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will ask that question for you,
Taco, but I'm going to reiterate it a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit more.
[SPEAKER_05]: He always wants to know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, I need to start making this
a staple because it's a fun conversation
[SPEAKER_05]: topic to have with people all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do another show.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do a few different shows.
[SPEAKER_05]: My production company itself does the
Washington Weed Review.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do the Calyx podcast here with Sessions
and Meet the Breeders.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do another one that's just kind of
fun to get stoned on.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys are into conspiracy theories
and just like shooting the shit about
[SPEAKER_05]: that, that's something to do as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody wants to know from all my
guests, what are you guys' thoughts?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there aliens out there or not?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's aliens out there until the
government says they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I think there's other aliens out
there that the government's trying to hide
[SPEAKER_06]: from us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you guys ever had a paranormal
experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: Never.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in New Hampshire, up near the Loon
Mountain exit, there's a certain gas
[SPEAKER_02]: station and in the bathroom in the gas
station, all over the walls, there are a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of newspaper clippings of stories of
UFO activity in that area over the past,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how many hundreds of years
type of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, guys, you guys have like five more
minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have any more questions,
get them in there really quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I stuck you guys out on a desert
island, I said you can only take one.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can take a lifetime supply,
but you can only take one of your edibles
[SPEAKER_05]: with you for the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can take.
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably take the salsers personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take the salsers?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Island?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, it's an island vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus you get to have something to drink.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's the most important part.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fair enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fair enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they are 50 milligrams apiece.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure after a while, after a year on
the island, you're just going to be numb
[SPEAKER_05]: to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hydrated and I'm used to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd hate to be the guy that had to pick
you up from that after a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have seen some shit together.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like I definitely know your
story.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've heard there's now that's pretty
cool that you guys have a working
[SPEAKER_05]: relationship like that for as long as you
have and gone through the shit that you
[SPEAKER_05]: have for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that's no fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I got it a lot easier than most
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't imagine what you guys had to go
through.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I got to say, not only do I greatly
respect both of you for having gone
[SPEAKER_05]: through all that, still put all your love
and passion for the plant into what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, but having standards and morals of we
care what's going into our food,
[SPEAKER_05]: care about putting the best products into
what we're creating and making it
[SPEAKER_05]: something that's going to not only be
enjoyable and palatable, but amazing and
[SPEAKER_05]: new and coming up with new creations all
the time to meet the needs of these
[SPEAKER_05]: patients and putting people before,
you know, anything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really, really respect that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, for taking your time out of your day
to come join us and talk to us about
[SPEAKER_05]: tastefully baked.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a couple more questions really
quick before we bounce out of here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Steel says, I want to ask her if she uses
less than to emulsify her drinks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys use less, less than in
anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: We use sunflower less than it's a carrier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes as far as being manufactured,
but no, we don't add less than to
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and that one comes from Miranda.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Miranda.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for taking time out of
your day again, uh, to join me and do
[SPEAKER_05]: this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been an amazing episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: You both are amazing people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I definitely look forward to reviewing
these on our other show, the Washington
[SPEAKER_05]: Weed Review.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get royally fucked up on a
1500.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys can go over to tastefully baked
2.0 on Instagram and go check them out and
[SPEAKER_05]: see their processes, see how they go about
making some of these edibles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even that cheesecake bar that I just had,
they just put up a video of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like watching a cooking show.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys want to check out some of
their products, they're available up in
[SPEAKER_05]: Portland, Maine, and you can check them
out at tastefullybaked.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Until next time, this has been Doc Callux
with the Callux & Coop Podcast saying good
[SPEAKER_05]: night.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, baby,
[SPEAKER_04]: sweet honey, let's take it real soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know we got what you need,
baby, so take it and move along.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said we got what you need, honey,
come and move along.
I said we got what you need, baby,
so take it and move along.
