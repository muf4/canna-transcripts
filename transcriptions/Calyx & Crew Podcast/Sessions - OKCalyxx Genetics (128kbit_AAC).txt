[SPEAKER_01]: Ok calyx genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ok calyx.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that we're finally getting this
podcast in I've been meaning to have you
[SPEAKER_01]: on for a minute now today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are gonna be talking about hash making
we're gonna be talking about the pellet to
[SPEAKER_01]: layer ice cold h2o trichome isolation book
as Well as some of your genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I'm really stoked to hear what
you're doing So this hash, you know a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people know you for your composting and
I've seen you do a lot of content When it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to composting I feel like that's
people wanting me to talk about KNF and I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't always want to talk about KNF And I
know that you have another love and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: hash, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: You make some fire hash We absolutely
loved it and we're gonna kind of get back
[SPEAKER_01]: into those genetics later on in this
episode But first I want to hear about
[SPEAKER_01]: what you took away from this book You're a
guy that I look forward to hearing from
[SPEAKER_01]: when I need tips and advice on hash making
what did you get from that?
[SPEAKER_01]: This that helped you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the book was very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't doubt about it It's a collaborative
piece a lot of different hash makers that
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of you guys know and everybody
contributed a small piece They gave a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of information from their experience and
from the art that they perform,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know So it's really good lots of gold
legacy take away one thing good doc.
[SPEAKER_02]: You and I have the same washer We have the
same washer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a washer Or the same we have
the same press.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right the same press.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we do have the same press Yeah,
and I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good press I got a washer and
after I read this book I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm much I didn't buy the washer but it's
the bottom agitating washers the typical
[SPEAKER_02]: kind that you see everybody using you know
home growers using these little washing
[SPEAKER_02]: machines, but the Agitation on the bottom,
you know, it's talked about so negatively
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout this book and I was like,
oh gosh So now I'm gonna be like I got to
[SPEAKER_02]: find some hand washing equipment But the
reason I'm saying that is because he gave
[SPEAKER_02]: a nice little somebody I can't remember
who but one of the writers gave a nice
[SPEAKER_02]: little nugget saying Hand wash put all
your bud in your trim bag and give it a
[SPEAKER_02]: hand wash You know do that for two three
minutes, whatever and then put the washed
[SPEAKER_02]: bud into the washer And that is just a
good kind of give-and-take and I was kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of like yeah, that's great because really
I don't hand wash I just use My washing
[SPEAKER_02]: machine that I have and I really try to
filter it and clean it and all that stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: as I'm going But I think I'm gonna start
trying to hand wash a little bit Probably
[SPEAKER_02]: the first round just hand wash real good
and then we use my washer after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good nugget See and I'm on the
opposite end of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always hand wash and I've never used
one of the machines I was looking forward
[SPEAKER_01]: to it because I thought it would cut out
some of the manual labor and now you're
[SPEAKER_01]: You gave me some information earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like god.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn it No back to the hard work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, but the hard work usually pays off
the best, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's throughout the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always saying hand washing is the
best So the biggest problem with this
[SPEAKER_01]: motor on the bottom of the machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the problem with the bottom agitation
is that you know, the trichomes will sink
[SPEAKER_02]: to the bottom And the hand washing you
have a little false bottom down there
[SPEAKER_02]: every all your trichome can settle and
you're not stirring it a lot, you know As
[SPEAKER_02]: your hand as you're washing it,
it should be able to settle more in those
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger buckets with the bottom agitation
All you're doing is cycling the bits and
[SPEAKER_02]: pieces back, you know into the water along
with the trichome and they're just getting
[SPEAKER_02]: bashed down there, you know, just get
hammered hammered hammer as you're
[SPEAKER_02]: spinning it and it just leads to a You
know at least a little lesser quality
[SPEAKER_02]: product now as a home grower I'm not gonna
fuss and complain about the raw than I've
[SPEAKER_02]: made, you know, I liked it, but they're
you know We can clean it up a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: by not using that bottom agitation on my
first wash Really trying to get a good
[SPEAKER_02]: load of trichome heads off a hand washing
then loop to the washer But that bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: agitation just constantly is bashing those
trichomes because they think to the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the problem So this washer is
forcing all those trichomes That motion is
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of forcing it back up into the
material and not only that it's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: it's beating it around That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that the bottom You know, if you fit
some washing machines like clothing
[SPEAKER_02]: washing machines you if you look at the
bottom You know it turns back and forth
[SPEAKER_02]: back and forth and that's what my washing
machine does also It just it spins one way
[SPEAKER_02]: and then stops spins the other way and
then stops Yes as it's spinning it is well
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me put back up if you're not using a
trim bag and you just throw all your flour
[SPEAKER_02]: into the washing machine Which is what I
do It's really not good especially just
[SPEAKER_02]: because you're getting all kinds Of bits
and pieces and particles and all that good
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though the bud does float in the
water You're still getting little pieces
[SPEAKER_02]: stirred up with that bottom agitation and
those little bits and pieces are hitting
[SPEAKER_02]: those trichomes and either Sticking them
together or sticking to the trichome
[SPEAKER_02]: itself and they have contamination So if
someone can invent one of those washing
[SPEAKER_02]: machines with the Turner with that
agitation on the top, you might make some
[SPEAKER_01]: money There's a million dollar idea right
there and you just gave it to him That's
[SPEAKER_02]: right, because he even says in the book
there's nothing on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so, okay That's where you'd start
branding this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're handy Yeah, I got too many kids
Yeah, no, I hear you All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got this washer problem You're
saying manual is a way better way to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into the bags I've seen people
not using a work bag at all and I believe
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd Say use the work bag, right and not
only that You also have your collection
[SPEAKER_01]: bags and I've seen quite a few people
remove certain bags that they didn't want
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any benefits to this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: What I have done before and like I said
after I read this book and I went to a 918
[SPEAKER_02]: OG hash class a couple months ago And he I
mean it was just great information So I
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't washed since these class that
class in this book.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I say I used to do it this way
it's because I plan on doing it a new way,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I did not use a trim bag or anything I
just put the bud in the water,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, let it rehydrate and then wash
it that way I didn't use the trim bag and
[SPEAKER_02]: the reason I didn't use a trim bag is
because I did First couple washes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use a trim bag, you know You put this
that big kind of thing It's a 220 you put
[SPEAKER_02]: all your Bud in it and then you stick that
whole bag into the washer and that just
[SPEAKER_02]: washes in the bag And so all your weed is
kept in that bag, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it gets clogged quickly,
it gets clogged with just the resin and
[SPEAKER_02]: the tri-comb hitting that thing and when I
did a wash without it I had a much bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: return and I mean so much greater return
that I'm like I'm never using that bag
[SPEAKER_02]: again and I hadn't since but Hand washing
with that bag to get a real superior
[SPEAKER_02]: product That's how you have to do it And
then you then I would take everything out
[SPEAKER_02]: of that bag and put it in my washer and do
it the way I used to But using if you want
[SPEAKER_01]: higher quality, you need to use your trim
bag Okay, so it's not so much that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: let it's not letting good tri-comb heads
do but it's also taking out a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminants Yeah, it does definitely do
that and definitely holds a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminant But it does but it clogs and
they holds tri-comb into so, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we got a place your equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what you want Yeah, you want to do and
now you asked about the collection bags,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know the micron bags in the book he
suggests that you use all eight a full
[SPEAKER_02]: eight bag sets and that would be the 220
bag and then the the 190 the 160 the 120
[SPEAKER_02]: the 90 the 73 the 45 and the 25 and If
you're going to begin to wash if you have
[SPEAKER_02]: the money you might not But if you can get
the whole eight bag set you will start to
[SPEAKER_02]: learn Which micron bags catch the most and
you know, which is your good quality,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is your low quality?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now my advice is if you don't have the
money to buy all eight bags because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not cheap You know and they do
break and you need to get new one
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes but what you wanted to here's
what I have I have the well I'll start
[SPEAKER_02]: with the lower the lower number because
that's the one you stick in the container
[SPEAKER_02]: first That's like if you think of a five
gallon bucket I'm going to put one of my
[SPEAKER_02]: micron bags in first and it's going to be
that 25 micron inside of my 25 micron I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to stick My 73 micron and then I'm
going to stick inside 73 my 120 and then
[SPEAKER_02]: my 160 and the 220 is the last one the
highest quality bags are going to be your
[SPEAKER_02]: your 120 your 90 or 73 That's going to be
your best your best catch of head They're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to fit right there and you're going
to be able to wash some debris through and
[SPEAKER_02]: all that good stuff So 120 90 and 73 you
want those bags?
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure, you know if you can't afford any
other ones definitely get those three
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's what catches your good
stuff And then of course the 45 and the 25
[SPEAKER_02]: become lower quality as you go down It
just starts to catch a lot of the bits and
[SPEAKER_02]: pieces now I I will melt that down and
still use it myself for medicine the 25
[SPEAKER_02]: and the 45 It's still cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still gonna work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just has more contamination in it and
it will it will be almost a green You know
[SPEAKER_02]: greenish color sometimes that's your
contamination You do not want to use the
[SPEAKER_02]: 220 that's you're gonna throw that out
throw that in your compost and the 190 is
[SPEAKER_01]: rough also What is typically in those
bags?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the stocks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it leaf matter plant matter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so whenever you're washing so see
like When I wash my bud in my washing
[SPEAKER_02]: machine imagine if you will the washing
machine and I have all that bud in there
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's been spinning and spinning and
I'm ready to drain it and so Drain it down
[SPEAKER_02]: through all of those bags and what you're
catching is what has been washed off the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant And if you got a bunch of dirt,
you're gonna get all the dirt too,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's and pesticide anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting it But hopefully you don't
have that and you have a lot of resin a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of trichome head and you know,
you'll have Some of the stock we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking, you know, Michael's topic here
You gotta you know, the jeweler's are
[SPEAKER_02]: something but the stock of a trichome head
will be in those bags But what you want is
[SPEAKER_02]: that head?
[SPEAKER_02]: That little circle around pretty thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody looks at you trying to catch
just those, you know So you don't have a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of plant material.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not gonna have leaves or anything
You're just gonna have little bits of
[SPEAKER_02]: broken leaves think of you know,
what's referred to as contamination If you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't leave you just want that hit right
one thing that I wanted to ask you about
[SPEAKER_01]: is full spec What do you need to match
that description of full spec?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one of these bags are we taking from
and what needs to be included?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the final product.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I will let's see Let me read
you from the book on page 17 under the
[SPEAKER_02]: title collection bag Another method of
collection would be to mix all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: various bags together to make what is
known as full spec It's letting to go the
[SPEAKER_02]: full spec drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be wise to remove all the bags
and use only your high quality bags your
[SPEAKER_02]: 120 at 90 is 73 maybe your 45 and 25 but
when you mix all of your bags all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: You know the products that you've
collected in your bags a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: want to keep The 73 by itself because they
feel that's the best quality and they
[SPEAKER_02]: won't mix it with the 90 or the 120 Micron
bag they keep it all separate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what the book is saying if you want to
do a full spec You're going to mix your
[SPEAKER_02]: 120 your 90 or 73 45 25 You can mix it all
together if you want or you can just
[SPEAKER_02]: choose three bags to mix together and you
get this what's called full spec Okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: so either way nice I was hoping it wasn't
gonna include that Contamination bag that
[SPEAKER_01]: you were talking about with all the leaf
matter and everything the 220 now.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's make sure that everybody
understands That was not not those
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminations that like the 220 the 190
the 160 Those are gonna be rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe 160 smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've kept it many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever smoked it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes There's people going to you,
but they've done it To they've done it to
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, man, I'm a home medicator,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you got to try your stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to try it Yeah, I've thrown away
lots of rosin guys lots of rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just like I'm not smoking that I messed
that up bad Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, I haven't made enough to say
that actually I just messed up a batch of
[SPEAKER_02]: one of my genetics my TKLV I'm just
learning how to jar tech it because I
[SPEAKER_02]: learned it at 918 oh jeez class He taught
us how to you know use heat and all this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff because I've never done it
[SPEAKER_01]: I have done that I have done that and I
have had success recently But the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: thing is patience and I definitely screwed
up my first one it turned into this
[SPEAKER_01]: decarved black almost clear crap That's
how we learn though That's correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to mess up man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to mess up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've learned about this manual washing
versus the Machine washing and which one's
[SPEAKER_01]: better we talked about collection bags and
the use of the work bag What's the next
[SPEAKER_01]: step after this you've grabbed all your
hash and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you gonna dry it out?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the tough one This is the step
that if you're a home grower and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: want to get into get your own hash making
and really trying to get quality You're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna have to figure out ways To dry this
stuff and it's nice When you know guys
[SPEAKER_02]: grows like I do who have freezers and all
that stuff and I can take it up there when
[SPEAKER_02]: I want it frozen I don't always want it
froze freeze-dried.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I just like it room-dried.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that sometimes that has a better
taste Sometimes when it's freeze-dried,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's hard to work with it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for me It is and but I need more
experience, of course But for me,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a little harder work with when it's
frozen when it's when it's been dried like
[SPEAKER_02]: on cardboard in front of a fan in my Shit,
it tastes good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's how I do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever I've washed and I I'm scraping
all of that gooey goodness out of those
[SPEAKER_02]: Micron bags what I do as a home grower and
don't everybody freak out But this is how
[SPEAKER_02]: it has to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I will get parchment paper and
I'll I'll spread it out as thin as I
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly can on parchment paper and even
you might you can even add a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: water and to even get it thinner and you
don't think in that counterproductive
[SPEAKER_02]: because you're Trying to get to dry it
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually if you can get the chunk
thinner, you know If you're gonna have
[SPEAKER_02]: blobby chunks and you need to get it nice
and flat and the thinner you can get it
[SPEAKER_02]: You can spread it out over more surface
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get it to dry out faster So a
little water actually helps get it spread
[SPEAKER_02]: out You put it like a parchment sheet or
parchment paper inside a cookie sheet is a
[SPEAKER_02]: good way to do it Put all your that you
have sure put all of your bubble hash that
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got add a little water Make sure it
gets nice and thin and then put a fan on
[SPEAKER_01]: it dries out fast We're talking about how
long are we talking about on a dry time?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like flour the slower you go the
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be It just needs to dry out for
me from my experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean somebody else smarter me might tell
you something different But I just need to
[SPEAKER_02]: get it dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You definitely don't want water at all
You're gonna run it you start to learn
[SPEAKER_02]: that you had water in your hash and it's
like, oh dang it You know a little burning
[SPEAKER_02]: nasty pasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, put it on that parchment paper
inside a cookie Okay cooking sheet add a
[SPEAKER_02]: little water thin it out real well spread
it all over get a lot of surface area
[SPEAKER_02]: covered Add a fan on it and you know,
and it needs to not be in a hot hot shed
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to be if you can keep it,
you know 60 70 that'd be nice let it dry
[SPEAKER_02]: out and then again My storage has changed
big time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you storing it in about the same
conditions?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never store it once it's dried I
immediately pressed it just because I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't have ability to really store it for
well But after reading this book actually
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh frozen storage page 30 in the fabulous
book called ice cold h2o trichome
[SPEAKER_02]: isolations by Pele Pele page 30 Here's
some tips guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you this this is just good
stuff Turpenes are easily lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm reading from the book here Turpenes
are easily lost through temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: fluctuation The key is to always keep the
bubble hash, which is what we scraping out
[SPEAKER_02]: of their bags everybody So we're talking
about bubble hash Always keep the bubble
[SPEAKER_02]: hash in the freezer in a parchment lined
mason jar Never compressed bubble hash at
[SPEAKER_02]: all treat the hash very gently Don't pack
your hash down in that jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to do that I used to not as much as
I could but I mean I packed it in because
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have enough jars Maybe but now
it's like oh, yeah, keep this stuff fluffy
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it put that parchment paper inside
that mason mason jar, you know and get
[SPEAKER_02]: that top on it keep it cold Take care of
it like it's a dang newborn baby because
[SPEAKER_02]: you're keeping all those turps in there
And of course, that's the ultimate thing
[SPEAKER_02]: when we're dealing with hash when we're
dealing with rosin We're wanting we know
[SPEAKER_02]: the highs gonna be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's gonna be there, you know,
but we want that flavor pop We want it to
[SPEAKER_02]: just be like You know smack your lips
trying to run it through your nose again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taste it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we want to keep this stuff nice
and cold Keep it, you know low temps.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay What size portions would you put in?
[SPEAKER_01]: What size jar I?
[SPEAKER_02]: Use what is it like half quart mason jars
with the small ones?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe pump no half pint jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but Really you don't want a lot of
air So I would go ahead and just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: fill it up to the top close it up You
know, you don't want just a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: air in there The problem is you don't
always have a lot of a lot of hash if you
[SPEAKER_02]: can only fill your jar halfway up Cover it
with parchment paper before you feel it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know cover it put parchment paper down
on the top of it a little bit and then So
[SPEAKER_02]: your jar, I mean it's the best you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you understand what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I'm taking in a lot of this man
because like I said lately I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: growing some more hash oriented cultivars
So even though I'm a heavy flower guy,
[SPEAKER_01]: I love bubble hash I just hated do the
doing the manual mixing of all of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know So I was really looking I was
looking forward to that But if the quality
[SPEAKER_01]: is the best on the manual go back to it
It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not throwing my machine away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you heard me say that I'm still keeping
it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still beneficial Especially for
people like me that don't want to bend
[SPEAKER_01]: their back over stirring, you know for
what three minutes in segments So let's go
[SPEAKER_01]: over Some terms that you were talking
about earlier when we were talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: you coming on the podcast and talking
about There was a few things that you said
[SPEAKER_01]: that I kind of wanted you to elaborate on.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Greasing versus pre greasing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Yeah, this is new to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me start off with that,
but it's just oh, this is new to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay Yeah, but the words the labeling of
the action, you know I'm saying like I
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of did it but I didn't know We're
gonna grease or pre grease, you know stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's fun to know those words for me I
like it because it just it cleans It up,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know cleans conversation up quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see page 27, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's where the terms pre greasing and
greasing and stamping is also there but
[SPEAKER_02]: Pre greasing and that's g-r-e-a-s-i-n-g
like grease and it's because you're gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: get greasy You know when you're when
you're smashing these heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's gonna get greasy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want some grease?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pre greasing is when let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see if I can actually read it as
Mention, let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another technique is to pre grease the
hash and form hash pucks using a pre press
[SPEAKER_02]: mold So you guys know I'm talking about a
lot of you have those press molds circles
[SPEAKER_02]: or squares You put your hash in there and
you're just kind of compacting it down
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to get it even You don't want holes
in your hash, you know in that little
[SPEAKER_02]: pocket You want it nice and solid you want
it nice and flat on the top and bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: because you want surface area You want it
to be able to spread out nice and easily
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying when you pre
grease your bubble hash You are just
[SPEAKER_02]: putting it into a mold form not in a bag
and that's how I'm understanding pre
[SPEAKER_02]: greasing and I mean I think a lot of
people pre grease and then the other one
[SPEAKER_02]: called greasing is how I'm understanding
is when you have when you put your bubble
[SPEAKER_02]: hash in the bag itself and Then you give
it that good nice smashing and you try To
[SPEAKER_02]: even it out throughout the bag at the
corners filled up and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's called greasing your bag So
those are two fun terms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea but those are terms I'm
assuming good hash makers use Because they
[SPEAKER_02]: talked about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They they use that, you know, they use
that in this book I'm not a good hash
[SPEAKER_01]: maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sitting here going you do that you
spread it over the bottom of the bag I was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, I'll scoop it up with the spoon When
you got your bubble hash in your in your
[SPEAKER_02]: bags and you're gonna put it in your press
and smash it You don't want one part
[SPEAKER_02]: thicker than the other part and you don't
want one corner skinnier than the middle
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying you want it
spread out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want a nice even press There's a style
called bottle tech style and it's where
[SPEAKER_02]: you take your rosin bags Like when I press
rosin or sorry when I press bubble hash
[SPEAKER_02]: into rosin I use two 25 micron bags I
double bag it right 25 microns are very
[SPEAKER_02]: very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really you have five kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do not double bag it Your wife is over
there shaking her head she will be when
[SPEAKER_02]: she is the podcast If you don't double bag
you blow out everybody and that's how you
[SPEAKER_02]: get five kids You did that, of course I
did this my show So you're double bagging
[SPEAKER_01]: it you're double begging it Real good when
I've got it in there, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but actually hold on we were talking about
bottle thing That's what we were talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to something else real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So bottle pecking your your rosin bag
Here's the idea And you got to use your
[SPEAKER_02]: imagination with me You're holding your
small little 25 few micron bag and the
[SPEAKER_02]: opening is towards the top, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: the bottom corners What you do is you
would take a pin or a dab tool and you
[SPEAKER_02]: invert the corner So the corner isn't
poking out but it's now poking up and into
[SPEAKER_02]: the bag you know what I'm saying and you
do that on both bottom corners and Okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: so the idea is that that is stopping the
little Bitty corner from not having
[SPEAKER_02]: anything in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I knew that but why do you do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll catch your rosin like if you just
left the bag Unbottle tech if you will
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got and you fill it up with rosin
or flour You're gonna have the core the
[SPEAKER_02]: edges the corners not full and those
little things are like pockets to catch
[SPEAKER_02]: all your You know, you know I'm saying I
won't catch all of it, but it will catch
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, so when you put the corner when
you invert the corner You have bubble hash
[SPEAKER_02]: consuming that inverted corner,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pushing they're pushing past then
instead of filling it up That makes a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of sense and there's no there's no hole
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the idea it is stamping I think
Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna read from the book again on page
27 Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually pretty damn smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the stamping that you were talking
about?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does the book say?
[SPEAKER_02]: The book says Pre-pressing your filter
bags once packed is not a bad idea either
[SPEAKER_02]: This is stamping you fill your bags and
then like if you have a big square mold or
[SPEAKER_02]: a long rectangle mold that fits your bag
or whatever Whatever form you're using a
[SPEAKER_02]: circle even you know pack your bags and
then put them back in the mold stamp it
[SPEAKER_02]: real good get it all packed in and then
race put it in your press Let's stamp in
[SPEAKER_02]: your bag and I can tell you right now
Philly polar if you're listening And I
[SPEAKER_02]: make any mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize, please correct me,
but that's that's how I'm a standing book
[SPEAKER_01]: You betcha we mess up This is a show where
we smoke a lot of cannabis so mistakes are
[SPEAKER_01]: bound to happen So when you're doing the
stamping there's no heat on the plates at
[SPEAKER_02]: all Yeah, that's correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not you're not doing anything with
your plate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're only met your heating plates.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're only messing with a cold Probably a
luminous steel little little piece Okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: so a pre-press mold like for a flower
would be the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we could be the same thing exactly
Okay, so I have one more question for you
[SPEAKER_01]: really quick before we go to break fresh
frozen What is the qualifying term for
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh frozen?
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about this in our discord
the other day the guys were asking me is
[SPEAKER_01]: this mean that it's taken Down right away
that it's frozen right there does fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: frozen or like a freeze dryer Does that
count as fresh frozen my answer at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was I had always heard even if you had
taken the plant down let it do a slow dry
[SPEAKER_01]: Before curing and using it that still
qualifies as fresh frozen Okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: this was addressed at nine one eight OGs
homemakers hash class So yeah fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_02]: is when is when you cut the plant You cut
all your families off or anything that
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't isn't consumed with trichome,
you know and Okay, so see that this my
[SPEAKER_02]: brain locking up to shows you I learned so
dang much I don't know where to go
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes now, but nine one eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said He likes to what's called what in
the books?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's kind of called.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, it's not he likes to Sometimes
depending on the strain, of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's all strain dependent But sometimes he
will like he'd like some strains to dry
[SPEAKER_02]: for many Maybe a two or three days then he
puts it into the freezer and treats it the
[SPEAKER_02]: same And he says often you get better
taste, you know, you get more return for
[SPEAKER_02]: sure He says you always get more return
almost always he said you'll get a bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: return Whenever you cut the plant let it
dry for two to three days then stick it in
[SPEAKER_02]: the freezer and Then treat it like fresh
frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a better return with the fresh
frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it tiles and cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like evaporating on but you're getting I
think you're getting Here's what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: learning a little bit and based on page 7
Which deals with all these trichome heads
[SPEAKER_02]: and the epidermal cells and the hypodermal
cells, you know of the trichome stocks it
[SPEAKER_02]: actually there's more water getting out of
the plant and so that stock gets a little
[SPEAKER_02]: more brittle and So it breaks off easier
and you get them you get a bigger release
[SPEAKER_02]: on your first wash, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They just get a good amount off of it So a
little bit of drying kind of dehydrates it
[SPEAKER_02]: and helps to make things brittle But if
you do it too much, it makes your leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: brittle too.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, and so you can't do it too much
can't dry out too much Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that really interesting that you
didn't like the taste of the fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_01]: hash Next to yeah, you're you know home
dried because I feel the same way about
[SPEAKER_01]: flour Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather have a slow dried flour next to
yeah, this isn't any kind of braggart
[SPEAKER_02]: Thing and our processors in Oklahoma are
fantastic guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can promise you that the rec market here
is really known for fresh frozen It's take
[SPEAKER_01]: it down get it, you know in packages and
get it on the market as soon as possible I
[SPEAKER_01]: just don't I see a big degradation in
flavor and quality overall the way I like
[SPEAKER_02]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to press my flour I love press
flour rosin because to me it has the most
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor and it has a morph a more body High
a more of a head high body high,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just a thicker high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's a good word for it I like flour
pressed and I like that flour rosin but of
[SPEAKER_02]: course, I love bubble hash rosin because
it does have good taste but the high is
[SPEAKER_02]: just Really good, you know really quick
good high you can tell you like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, that's good stuff But I love the taste
of flour rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's me the anything, you know,
the things that you painted for me were
[SPEAKER_02]: all flour Just press flowers, you know
wasn't bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some of those bubble has
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I haven't had too much whenever we
have bubble hash We typically smoke it and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why I want to get a washer
something like that so I can try pressing
[SPEAKER_01]: the bubble ash so most of what I've done
so far has just been flour pressing but
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really really enjoying it and I agree
with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor is there good and Every single
one of those was delicious too,
[SPEAKER_01]: by the way You took some of those Genetics
from those concentrates that you gave us
[SPEAKER_01]: and you actually started working them into
your own lines, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is correct that blueberry muffin from
the Humboldt C company that sent to you
[SPEAKER_02]: that that was the best flower rosin I ever
had in my life and it's just a I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: just to press the flower I mean the flower
smells so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, anybody who's grown that blueberry
muffin knows what we're saying It smells
[SPEAKER_02]: so good and the taste is lingers in your
nose Oh is the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, I took that blueberry muffin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was good stuff and The one plant that
I'm really going to focus on because you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't do all I do all those crosses and I
give away lots of seeds So you can't
[SPEAKER_02]: really breed a bunch of strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much work and me being a home
grower I can't have a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: plants going so my focus is what's called
the blueberry squealer and that is the
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry muffin and It has been crossed
with blueberry train Mac from black label
[SPEAKER_02]: organic and that is Brandon Russ.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a just a fantastic grower full of
knowledge and A super super duper helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, great genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure a lot of you guys know So I
crossed those two together and it got
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry squealer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's nine Blueberry squeal is
going right now and we're trying to get
[SPEAKER_02]: those going and again great genetics,
you know Hunt is like the great those
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome guys who've got the big buildings,
you know, we're gonna do Awesome a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're gonna Fino hunt, you know I'm
Fino honey eight or nine and that's how I
[SPEAKER_02]: can do it That's how a lot of your home
growers can do it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just get started but I've got my
blueberry squealers and I'm gonna try to
[SPEAKER_02]: See the pretty ladies and find that one
good male if I get one they haven't been
[SPEAKER_02]: sested yet I don't know what they are,
but I want to get them to f2s get them in
[SPEAKER_02]: their threes or back crossing and all that
good stuff Cuz that taste I've had the
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry trademark and it's just
delicious the blueberry muffin hook
[SPEAKER_02]: delicious So they got married and they had
a baby and I think this baby's gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: delicious to blueberry squealer Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna take a quick break when we get
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hear more about that blueberry
squealer We're also gonna talk more about
[SPEAKER_01]: your genetics the lady breath lines that
you're working with Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we will be right back with the
calyx and crew podcast with okay calyx

[SPEAKER_00]: to the boys doc and okay calyx and see how
they're doing All right, we are back with
[SPEAKER_01]: okay calyx of okay calyx genetics we
talked about hash Now I want to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: the hash that you're making the plants
that made those hash These are your own
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics that you're working with right
now You were talking about the blueberry
[SPEAKER_01]: muffin the blueberry train Mac I want to
hear a little bit more about that one And
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the other stuff that you're
working with the lady breath and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: What made you what made you want to work
with them?
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got let me pull up my phone here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I got a note on here So I don't have
to remember it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: The lineage of lady breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they in the lineage of the TK
plants Pulled those two things up So I
[SPEAKER_02]: crossed the blueberry but that we're
talking about the blueberry muffin The
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt Sea Company and blueberry train
Mac from black label organics here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Oklahoma Cross those up and we've got
blueberry squealers going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the sex didn't get but I got
I think I think it was eight Or I have
[SPEAKER_02]: going they're all about two three inches
tall But we're doing a little senile hunt
[SPEAKER_02]: with those and trying to get a best dude
and really See what we can get going.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in the early stages of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's where we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've sent out a lot of seeds So you're
referring to all the a couple of plants
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've done When I cross like when I
find a a male and I'm like, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: this smells awesome I'm gonna cross it
with everything I can put me another
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm growing, you know, I'm just gonna
cross with every strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm growing That's my approach because
that's how I like to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't always do that But whenever I'm
whenever I find like I found a killer
[SPEAKER_02]: queen male that was so pretty and so big
and it was just aggressive like I had a
[SPEAKER_02]: few people come out to my house and we're
actually looking at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is the best smell I've ever
grown anyway, that killer queen male was a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant It was a male that I used to
pollinate a herd of strains and that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: been a couple years back But I've seen a
lot of those out and on my genetics page.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay collection at okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calix genetics at okay Calix genetics
You'll see pictures of some of those old
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses that are kind of starting to come
back now, you know, it's kind of that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what It's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sent out feeds a year ago and Now you
start to see some pictures of the results
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's fun and that's one of the
problems breeding You have to wait so
[SPEAKER_02]: long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah takes a lot of time but that killer
queen was a beautiful male and I just
[SPEAKER_02]: crossed a lot of things up and I've sent
out a lot of things a lot of strains to
[SPEAKER_02]: people and it's been fun it's been
rewarding also because I've got to know so
[SPEAKER_02]: many people on Instagram and I'm talking
Oklahoma folks where we I've met them
[SPEAKER_02]: we've I've gone to their house or we've
met someplace and we smoke just to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: and meet each other because we're we have
so much you know, this one thing in common
[SPEAKER_02]: we love cannabis and we can just talk and
talk and talk but It's been fun for me to
[SPEAKER_02]: send my send all these strains out and and
see some fun things come back You're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: those drops all the time Yeah,
man, those drops people love those jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so fun, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could do that around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not enough growers I have to most
of my buddies that Are in Washington or
[SPEAKER_01]: over on the West Coast?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like fuck am I gonna make a
three-hour run and then drive around to
[SPEAKER_01]: places?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know Hope you guys get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no, I applaud this shit out of you for
doing that Whenever you pollinate things
[SPEAKER_02]: and like when I pollinate I pollinate I
pollinate every plant I've got but you
[SPEAKER_02]: you're gonna end up with thousands of
seeds that you will never use,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why why not be a blessing to somebody and
just send them some seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck man, they might find a unicorn that
they think is just fantastic You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what's so cool about our community.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll feel kind of public We can make our
own medicine and send it through seed to
[SPEAKER_02]: people and they can grow themselves I find
that fascinating because I love nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just fascinating that we can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that's the most amazing way
I've ever heard that put One plant that I
[SPEAKER_02]: really liked and I took it To f2s right
now is what I call TKLB and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: triangle kush crossed with lady breath but
Triangle kush is it has a really long name
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's called the actual name that Russ
Brand that Russ Brandon gave to it or
[SPEAKER_02]: sorry Brandon Russ gave to it is Train as
I sorry triangle kush crossed with
[SPEAKER_02]: triangle kush crossed with northern lights
five haze crossed with lime 1bx Which is
[SPEAKER_02]: also known as What is it lime one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Great soda.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see what lime one great soda skunks
Yeah, it's a crazy long name and it's too
[SPEAKER_02]: much to even try to comprehend while we're
just talking We can't see it in front of
[SPEAKER_02]: us very well But it's a triangle kush,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a it's got a that lime grape
cross in there has a little hand of lime
[SPEAKER_01]: to it It's got a that deep kush so this
TKLB You were talking about the cross on
[SPEAKER_01]: that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a it's not a TK.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a TK hybrid It's something else has
been crossed with the TK Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a it's a yeah He drew out the
the lineage is the name basically if you
[SPEAKER_02]: know what I'm saying Triangle kush cross a
triangle kush northern lights five haze
[SPEAKER_02]: crossed with lime 1bx.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's the plant That's the lineage
and that's the name and then you cross
[SPEAKER_02]: that with the lady breath So that yeah,
that was a female that's from black label
[SPEAKER_02]: that key TK is from black label organics
here in Oklahoma I took and then I took a
[SPEAKER_02]: lady breath and I got this lady breath
from a friend at El Dancorino here in town
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've met through Instagram He had
this lady breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of a smaller plant But it's
the male the pollen sacks are purple and
[SPEAKER_02]: red and it was just real enticing to the
eye to me It wasn't a big plant at all,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was so pretty the man I hadn't seen
a male like have a lot of color,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know Do you have you seen males with
lots of colors because you give you those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants way more than me I think that I
yeah, I've found quite a few colorful
[SPEAKER_01]: males But to be attractive to the eye like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's not very often.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think I had one in the Sunni
recently that was very very black by late
[SPEAKER_01]: blooms and then the other one was the
blueberry grapefruit by Relic seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: that was the goose Bay blueberry crossed
into the grapefruit inbred line I believe
[SPEAKER_01]: don't quote me on it But I'm pretty sure
that was that was close to what it was But
[SPEAKER_01]: that thing was awesome in the mail on that
one threw out like these deep purple Stems
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the actual petals of the flower
were more of like a lavender red purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was beautiful Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're not I mean you're gonna get
a lot of green and yellow ones just like
[SPEAKER_02]: the females, you know Yes, the male the
lady breath male had real pretty color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay lady breath is from at family tree
feet He seems to be a really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes look at his page She is a real
organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is just seems to be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a YouTube page also Anyway,
the lady lady breath males was so pretty I
[SPEAKER_02]: like the color of It crossed it with with
a tk that had tried and I'd liked and the
[SPEAKER_02]: the lady breath What appealed to me strain
wise with lady breath is the lineage?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the the lady breath lineage The male
was an orchard lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say it again The male was an orchard
lady and orchard lady is Pam one crossing
[SPEAKER_02]: citrus farmer They know that Pam one is
just gorgeous and then that plant Was used
[SPEAKER_02]: to cross the Mendo breath, which is og
cush breath and Mendo Mendo montage I
[SPEAKER_02]: believe that cross made lady breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that the bat that lineage was like man
that just sounds awesome Yes, I want this
[SPEAKER_02]: male plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I totally that threw up that looked at
it So the cross is called TKLB or the
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrid there those two plants is called or
the cross is called TKLB I have it in f2s
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting pictures back from sending
them to the f1s out and At Tim Wetzel,
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe he's grown one of them and it is
just colorful as can be and that was what
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wanting It's so pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that male really projected that Yes,
and that's you know, it did the one he got
[SPEAKER_02]: it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was they know that's kind of
hopeful That's cool for me trying these
[SPEAKER_02]: things and like yeah, I wanted that color
So and I and I've got other TKs coming
[SPEAKER_02]: back also plants that haven't fully
flowered yet, you know, but We'll see some
[SPEAKER_02]: more pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what's coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's fun for me now this TKLB when I
in f1s I found I got a male, you know that
[SPEAKER_02]: I like but like just a Good-looking male
had nice big fat fan leaves, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just good-looking stalk Well, it wasn't a
whole lot of color anything like that is
[SPEAKER_02]: the girth of the plant I liked but I took
that TKLB F1 male and I did my thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pollinated everything I had outside so
that included a Nag Champa from turkine
[SPEAKER_02]: turkine which is just Wonderful hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard a lot of people talking about
that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh My goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, I've got my earpiece about to
go down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think nag breath That's what that is TKL
a nag chant nag champ across TKLB.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got nag breath I have blueberry
breath, which is blueberry muffin crossed
[SPEAKER_02]: with TKLB.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to try that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir It's coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got the I've got those growing right
now if one's coming up I got a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: growing and I actually have a lot of
people growing those I'll say one thing
[SPEAKER_02]: about that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's how I messed up Here's something I
learned and became better after that plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and this is what people this is why we
talk make other people better what I did
[SPEAKER_02]: was I took I took about a 25 gallon pot
and I got two blueberry muffin females
[SPEAKER_02]: going in that pot and then I found the
blueberry train Macmill That I wanted and
[SPEAKER_02]: I put it in that same pot and they weren't
all real big but it was just something I
[SPEAKER_02]: was doing something I was messing with and
just having fun and So they all got about
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know two feet tall in this big pot
But what I learned was this I rushed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't let the I didn't let those plants
veg I didn't let my females veg long
[SPEAKER_02]: enough I let them go I let him get kind of
big and I was like man, I want to flower
[SPEAKER_02]: them because I want to get these seeds
going You know and all this and so I
[SPEAKER_02]: intentionally rushed it But I didn't
realize that there's a detriment to it by
[SPEAKER_02]: not letting your females veg out and kind
of mature a little bit You know in veg
[SPEAKER_02]: even and then let them flower for a week
or two before you hit them with the pollen
[SPEAKER_02]: You know mine did a veg real long and they
got hit with pollen on day one They put
[SPEAKER_02]: out a pistol because that male how already
had pollen just flying from it,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: and so that small kind of or that I guess
Maybe not totally mature veg plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: then real early pollination Reading the
books that I've been reading now Those are
[SPEAKER_02]: two things that that I I saw in books that
they'll say yeah, this might cause you a
[SPEAKER_02]: problem You got to let these plants mature
a little bit more in veg and in flower
[SPEAKER_02]: before you know anything happens if you're
going to breed so Don't rush it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to let them grow a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them get in the flower Let the more
than one pistol show you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let a good Three-week flower get on it
before you put pollen on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something I would agree with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes This isn't my job, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have other businesses that I do as my
income This is passion and fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: My cannabis life is passion and fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best way for it to be That's
why I do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm just learning I'm learning I
don't know anything you don't need to know
[SPEAKER_01]: everything but it's just like growing you
do not know unless you do it somebody can
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you this way this way this Way all
day, but until you try it in your own
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, you will not know for sure
Exactly, that's right and it goes the same
[SPEAKER_02]: as breeders and stuff like I don't know
every breeder But I do know the ones that
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working their stuff with that I really
want to know more that the more I work
[SPEAKER_02]: with their stuff You know, it's like and
that and those are the only breeders I
[SPEAKER_02]: know but there's so many more out there So
yeah, I don't act, you know, you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: either we don't act like we know
everything now and that's a good way to be
[SPEAKER_02]: in this world because there's two much you
need to specialize a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to shrink your focus down some
and and Not try to think you can do
[SPEAKER_02]: everything because you can't focus on a
few things that be great at them That's
[SPEAKER_02]: what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never stop learning and then get other
people straight stuff Yes, never stop
[SPEAKER_01]: learning get great at what you do So you
crossed it with a blueberry muffin?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm really really interested in
that blueberry bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I took The TK took the TK LB
crossed it with the blueberry muffin and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's called blueberry breath Of course
because the lady breath and because I
[SPEAKER_02]: can't think of any original names very
well I never know but there's lots of
[SPEAKER_02]: those growing right now and I hope we get
a blueberry cushy thing happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's what I was hoping for
Gassy blueberry that'd be cool crossed it
[SPEAKER_01]: with the neg champ That sounds really good
because I've been wanting to grow some of
[SPEAKER_01]: terp fiends gear Yeah, what did you cross
it to anything else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I did I crossed it to and I still
have yet to hear how this name is
[SPEAKER_02]: pronounced So let me fill it L I M E C AI
see AI Lime sigh Lime Kai Lime sigh,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's agree that it's lime guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like lime and a side lime side
Yes, you are right because it's it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: a side gelato cross With key lime a boom
lime say that's what this is and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: from at umami Seiko that's who did the
lime kai I've never heard that name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay, and Tim at Tim Wetzel grew one
of these lime lime kais out and you got to
[SPEAKER_02]: go look at it It's freaking frosty and
just beautiful looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay couch genetic I posted it but I
crossed lime kai with TK LB and that lime
[SPEAKER_02]: breath, of course Okay, so pictures have
come back on that one and it's a nice one
[SPEAKER_01]: lime breath That does sound good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't you do a g-13 cross?
[SPEAKER_02]: I did I did a g-13 great across the g-13
genius from Brothers Grimm with Lady with
[SPEAKER_02]: TK LB.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh You gave us that g-13.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was excellent, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Yeah, that g-13 firewalls so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love that one That was one of my
favorites and it just hits you right in
[SPEAKER_01]: the forehead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent a year growing all Brothers Grimm
genetics and man It was really good time
[SPEAKER_02]: that that is good genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed it I will never forget that if
forever you were doing Brothers Grimm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like he feels About Brothers Grimm
the way I feel about dynasties Which is
[SPEAKER_01]: excellent because dude Oh that grim glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever cross anything to that grim
glue?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, never did a grim glue, you know,
why I was a good one, too That grim glue
[SPEAKER_02]: was one of the most beautiful plant that I
had grown I took a picture of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay cow at age and it's a beautiful dark
red color but The thing about the grim
[SPEAKER_02]: glues that I grew the the bugs are just
too small You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: There are lots of them But they you know,
if you got a kind of a small bud on the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, it's gonna dry up to a real small
bud so When I was you know, we're doing a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of the commercial growing that just
one go fly So it got good, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man, that was a great flavored one and
the consistency of that rosin too I was
[SPEAKER_02]: like butter but it was straight butter and
it came off it came out of the rosin bag
[SPEAKER_02]: and Just when it hit cooler air it
immediately went to that buttery look Nice
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't you working a granddaddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple there for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I had a granddaddy purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost this granddaddy purple of fungus I
lost about six tenths one time to some
[SPEAKER_02]: stinking fungus that got a hold everything
and once I saw it I was like guys we got
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Yeah, take it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wiped out all our kids and started
over but this granddaddy purple this
[SPEAKER_02]: granddaddy purple was at the grow When I
started doing some commercial growing the
[SPEAKER_02]: grow I went to had this granddaddy purple
and it was in flower and it Was so pink
[SPEAKER_02]: and purple and I just like that is
beautiful again when I see something I'd
[SPEAKER_02]: be I love beauty I'm attracted to
beautiful things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love my I love my plants that flowers in
them I love the crop cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the way compost looks when it's
through but I love that And this GDP was
[SPEAKER_02]: so pretty there's some guys that are
growing GDP killer queen cross right now
[SPEAKER_02]: one of see his name is Grow so at grow
something with Trey, I believe he's in the
[SPEAKER_02]: pulpit here in Oklahoma, which is pretty
close to me about 30 minutes away from me
[SPEAKER_02]: He grew a GP killer queen that came back
just had a nice kind of purply look to it
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like oh, yeah, that was that GDP
mama.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh look how pretty it is You know,
it was fun to see it again because I lost
[SPEAKER_02]: it nice, but I do still have some I have a
few crosses of GDP and something,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know I'm saying GDP killer queen GDP
lady breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I have still so yeah nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still alive With that killer queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does that sound familiar?
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll a queen is brother's grim killer
queen is the male that male I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes, that was during your brother's
grim run Yep, and I believe you did the
[SPEAKER_01]: Durban tie too, didn't you?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a Durban breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I crossed it across a Durban tie with
TKLB and I don't have many feet of Durban
[SPEAKER_02]: breath, but I did show my outside Durban
breath on okay calc genetics and it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: looker man I have some outside plants this
year that looked like inside plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just gorgeous nice, dude Yeah,
I've seen a lot of people growing out your
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics and you've been sharing it on
your story and those plants look amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: so Would it be fair to say that?
[SPEAKER_01]: From your standpoint one of the things
that you're breeding for is bag appeal and
[SPEAKER_02]: color well You know that yes now here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me press.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me qualify all this as I've done
breeding projects It's been for different
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons if you know what I'm saying and
that G that that GDP was definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: because I was like I want that purple I
just I don't care how you know how good it
[SPEAKER_02]: tastes or not I just want to see if I get
color in another flower, you know in its
[SPEAKER_02]: progeny And then with lady breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it was pretty but it was the triangle
kush and it was the lineage of lady breath
[SPEAKER_02]: with that Pam one citrus farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was definitely the draw that sealed
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I'm a what a beauty slut Like I
said, if it's pretty I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh man, I want to see it again You know
what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want that beauty.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, I gotta have that taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all has its place You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we get going I want to ask you
Grow green daddy pose this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't used it for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to use it again He always wants to
ask you guys which one of your creatures
[SPEAKER_01]: Creations do you think represents?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Calix genetics the best like if
there's one that somebody's gonna pick out
[SPEAKER_01]: and You're like, this is the one that I
want to represent what I'm doing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to pick one You can pick three
That's in three Max.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't fuck around on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only three non-juggets Isn't that an
interesting question and I don't know if
[SPEAKER_02]: I've ever Bred with that mentality in
mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't know if I ever said I want
something to represent what I like what I
[SPEAKER_02]: like it to smoke maybe you know what I'm
saying, but I Think what will represent me
[SPEAKER_02]: the most right now is my favorite that I
have yet to flower and that's blueberry
[SPEAKER_02]: squealer I love blueberry I fell in love
with blueberry muffin the first time I
[SPEAKER_02]: tried it and I'm trying to make something
great out of it right now You know what
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can improve on it who knows but I'm
starting with Something that I just I love
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'll grow it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought a pack of them a couple months
ago at Canna con here in Oklahoma I bought
[SPEAKER_02]: a pack of reg blueberry muffin seeds just
cuz I'm like, I just love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah And so yes, that one has passion in
it for me blueberry squealer It's a
[SPEAKER_02]: meaningful cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm really meaning to try to get this
flavor out that made me send you some You
[SPEAKER_02]: know, it was that dang good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Appreciate it brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're really into Blueberry not long
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: You played a do-or-dab Yes on our show on
Kellex and crew TV and you won some of
[SPEAKER_01]: those seeds from Romulan Jake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes At Romulan genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have plans with those?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh The plans are going right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have so I popped two seeds about two
months ago both of them male I grew them
[SPEAKER_02]: out a little bit and I'm starting and they
look totally different and actually I was
[SPEAKER_02]: taught I've been talking with Jake I have
I've seen pictures of the two different
[SPEAKER_02]: looks One look had a thick inside,
you know big fat thick families kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: staying close to the branch and Packing in
nodes and then the the other male the
[SPEAKER_02]: families the stem was noticeably longer So
much so that it seemed to open up the
[SPEAKER_02]: mill, you know, it seemed to be thin in
the middle And so anyhow, I threw it I cut
[SPEAKER_02]: a cold the thin looking one and I kept
that fat mean looking sucker and so I've
[SPEAKER_02]: got one Romulan male that I know for sure
is a male right now and I also have two
[SPEAKER_02]: new Romulan blueberries that I popped
about two weeks ago and they're about an
[SPEAKER_02]: inch tall right now and they're putting
off I think they've gone through there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably third set of leaves
cotyledon leaf and leaf right now Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's going to be an excellent
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes I what I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I oh my lord.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen it?
[SPEAKER_02]: He put he put you know, that was cool
about it If people don't know is his
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures are amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, well people don't know is I got
these and I had the mail already picked
[SPEAKER_02]: out that I wanted before he either
released them to the public that's because
[SPEAKER_02]: the the man dot Kalecks and Romney and
genetics giving them to me and that was
[SPEAKER_02]: cool feeling when he when he released him
and Romulan released it that day I took
[SPEAKER_02]: that snapshot put my male picture right
there with it in those like here it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, I have high hopes for Rom Romulan
blueberry and I can't wait to just get it
[SPEAKER_02]: in the mix and I here's my goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the here's the goal that I told a
couple of testers that that I work with is
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get I want to get one blueberry
strain that has you know, four blueberry
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses in it and that's probably going to
be blueberry muffin blueberry train Mac
[SPEAKER_02]: Romulan blueberry and possibly blueberry
cupcake from Humboldt that I've got going
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I've got another blueberry coming
and it's like it's called African
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberries phenyl number three and it's
from black box genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You told me about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Black box genetics and so it's a it's a
blueberry that has a sativa landrace cross
[SPEAKER_02]: in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just a different maybe high or a
feel, you know blueberry is kind of on the
[SPEAKER_02]: indica side often.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just a little different thing
but again for blueberry crosses is my own
[SPEAKER_02]: personal thing that I just kind of want to
have a blueberry strain that I've made
[SPEAKER_02]: that you know from four different
blueberry crosses and if that don't have a
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry turk to it, I don't know what to
do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to answer your question blueberry
squealer that one's going to define me
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't blueberry was never one of my
biggest ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like the flavor but the high didn't
typically work for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to try out those blueberry
grapefruit from relic that I was talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about that had amazing blueberry that blue
Magoo was another one that was really
[SPEAKER_01]: really good blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard you talk about that so many
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know when you go live and stuff you
talk about the blue magoo a lot and I I
[SPEAKER_02]: want that like you like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my baby for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took so long hunting her.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get some love brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am glad that you came on and shared so
much information with us about making hash
[SPEAKER_01]: on the Pele Pulaire book.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount of information that you went on
that I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope these guys learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your genetics man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been I've been noticing them and I'm
pretty sure other people are too and they
[SPEAKER_01]: are looking beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep up what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got good intentions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this and we back you 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a great guy and I want to thank you
again for coming on and sharing this
[SPEAKER_01]: information with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had such a fun time and I'd love to do
it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was such a joy talking to you tell your
wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you again because I know it's a big
deal what you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank poor kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are a handful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you as well with all of yours with
