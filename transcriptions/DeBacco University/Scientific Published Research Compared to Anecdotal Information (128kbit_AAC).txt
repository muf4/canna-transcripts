[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at a
general comparison between scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: published research and anecdotal
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to distinguish the difference
between the two may seem initially very
[SPEAKER_00]: obvious, but a lot of times people try to
blur the lines between these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at each of these and define
each to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, scientific research,
what defines this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a systematic investigation,
interpretation, and evaluation of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The results obtained from a small group
through scientific studies are shared,
[SPEAKER_00]: and new information is revealed with
respect to diagnosis, treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and reliability of applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So scientific research doesn't mean it's
occurred in a sterile lab here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other scientific studies that can
occur, but they all involve a systematic
[SPEAKER_00]: investigation is the key part here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're evaluating data, and that can
be in small groups, that can be with
[SPEAKER_00]: different scientists across different
parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part here is that interpretation
and evaluation of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in comparison, or actually in
contrast, anecdotal information is
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence collected in a casual or informal
manner, relying heavily or entirely on
[SPEAKER_00]: personal testimony.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stories you may hear, postings that you
may see, things you may read on a blog,
[SPEAKER_00]: things you may just read on the internet,
that's just from someone just posting,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's anecdotal information.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, going back to the scientific
research, there's also that collaboration,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically a peer review process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are able to compare and relate
that are in the field to what is found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anecdotal information is just one
person kind of putting something out there
[SPEAKER_00]: and just claiming it as truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind population size,
or n, of one doesn't support a pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because someone had success with one
plant doesn't necessarily mean that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to work for all plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar species can be used to draw some
conclusions and gain ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: For cannabis, chrysanthemums are used
sometimes for photoperiod development.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there can be unforeseen interactions
and complications which is why studies of
[SPEAKER_00]: the same species is recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these can be good for initial ideas or
research, but when you're actually coming
[SPEAKER_00]: down to developing that theory,
you want to use the actual test subjects
[SPEAKER_00]: there, the actual plants and species or
cultivar as close as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a scientific study does require use of
a control group, because this acts as a
[SPEAKER_00]: source of comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many conditions are kept consistent except
the one being tested, and this is true for
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Procedures conducted is well documented
and easily repeatable, and that's a key
[SPEAKER_00]: part with scientific studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see our control and our experimental
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here the experiment, will students' test
scores be affected by distracting sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: in the testing environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have that control group compared to
that experimental group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind we're not just testing one
student and one student, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: collection of students and a collection of
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would kind of be the general
sense or the general idea behind a
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anecdotal study, and I put study in
quotes here, they're often focused on what
[SPEAKER_00]: changes and does not ensure other
parameters are kept consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be a little bit focused on just
one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could be looking at different
fertilizer rates, but not taking into
[SPEAKER_00]: account that some plants might be more
shaded than others, some might be on the
[SPEAKER_00]: edge, the soil might not be consistent in
this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, all things are worth consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anecdotal studies are also common
performed on small population sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the key part here is they're typically
hard to recreate testing conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning if someone does test this and
prove it's something or have data to
[SPEAKER_00]: support something, typically it's very
hard to recreate those conditions so that
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be repeated and that data can be
supported and backed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's typically not true of any anecdotal
study, where definitely with our
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific studies, keeping the procedure
well documented and repeatable is a mark
[SPEAKER_00]: of a good scientific study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this gives you that kind of good
comparison between understanding what a
[SPEAKER_00]: published scientific research is compared
to just standard run-of-the-mill anecdotal
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
Thank you.
