[SPEAKER_00]: In the image here, I provided a wonderful
picture of a female flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at the anatomy of
this flower in a little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, here is kind of the
breakdown and description of the major
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of the female flower, identifying
the anatomy and some of kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: functionality of those within the flower
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it can be very difficult to see
here, so I've tried to provide you with
[SPEAKER_00]: another real-world image, much like you
saw on the first slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: of exactly what these parts are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trichomes, cola, calyx, pistil,
and nodes are terms you should be familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, if we look at that same
image, zoomed in a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cola is the main shoot apical meristem
where the bud is formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people will typically just refer to
that as the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pistil are these white structures we
see right here, and these are intended to
[SPEAKER_00]: collect pollen and are small hairs that
grow from the calyx.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of the stretching out and
increasing the surface area to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the odds that a pollen grain will land on
that to allow this flower to pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, in maximizing cannabinoid
production, we want to prevent that from
[SPEAKER_00]: ever occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: The calyx down here are predictive base
supporting the bud, and they're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: located at the bottom of that cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: The node is the point at which the leaves
branch from, so I don't want you to get
[SPEAKER_00]: that confused with a specific flower part.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where these leaves here,
the petioles of the leaves specifically,
[SPEAKER_00]: would be branching from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to increase in the space between
those nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is increased, that will cause the
plant to stretch, so our nodes are the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual point where the leaves branch from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inter nodes is the distance between those
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, though, this provides a little
zoomed in image of appreciating some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the functionality and identifying some of
the parts of a female flower.
