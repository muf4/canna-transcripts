[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over freeze drying and
[SPEAKER_00]: curing cannabis buds, which is kind of a
unique process that's kind of entering the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis world and probably here to stay
because it does produce a very interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: end product in a very short duration of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this video lecture will give
you some insight into this unique method
[SPEAKER_00]: of drying and curing cannabis buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at freeze drying and
curing cannabis buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not a new method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to think that this is
completely new and never heard of it
[SPEAKER_00]: before, but the general concept has been
around for many years and got its start in
[SPEAKER_00]: the food industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is gaining popularity with cannabis
since it can shorten the curing process to
[SPEAKER_00]: less than two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some companies are even claiming 24 to 36
hour total curing process with no loss in
[SPEAKER_00]: quality, maybe even improved quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also be done by home growers as
well as large scale commercial operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just limited to one particular
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be applied to both situations,
but definitely important is reduced curing
[SPEAKER_00]: time, much more advantageous in the large
scale commercial operations that may have
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of buds to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hanging versus freeze drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just kind of like a little quick
little comparison kind of between the two,
[SPEAKER_00]: typical hang dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at that 60 to 70 degrees
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between 45 and 55% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too hot is not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can break down the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does take time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can take upwards of three weeks
potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, those are the traditional hang
to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freeze drying says that it of course
maintains its freshness, really kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like pauses the plant ideally in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can say about 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go through the entire process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically freeze drying will preserve
and allows to maintain the terpene and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids because basically the enzymes
are frozen in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing is going to go through the
breakdown process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be literally as the name
implies, frozen in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is a nice comparison
between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both can result in quality end products,
but freeze drying does offer some
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediate benefits there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply there's no heat needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the absence of heat with this
curing process, the physical buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and terpenes can be better
preserved since they're frozen in time in
[SPEAKER_00]: a short curing cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to add any heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're literally frozen in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a great way to preserve and
maintain the original contents without
[SPEAKER_00]: risk of degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's also reduced curing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, compared to the traditional hanging
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduced curing time not only makes the
general process attractive to production
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, but there is the additional
benefit of reducing the risk of mold or
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew developing within the process
because you've taken that duration of time
[SPEAKER_00]: and you've really shortened it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's again, they're saying about 24
hours and does take specialized equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: and nothing's, you know, completely easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once set up, this is a very attractive
curing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just the basics of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the phase one, as the name would
imply, would be de-freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a quick freezing process where the
buds are exposed in negative four degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit or even colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: The colder temperatures may be harder to
achieve, but are advantageous to ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum freshness.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, colder is better to some extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get below minus 80 Fahrenheit,
really have diminishing benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can go lower than minus 80,
you've got a really special cryogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: freezer, but really you don't need to go
much more than minus 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minus 40 to minus 80 is a good target
range Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature should be maintained for
at least 10 hours to help preserve the
[SPEAKER_00]: physical structure of the buds there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a little temperature and a
little duration of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to kind of the stage of what's
called sublimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now sublimation is the process of changing
from a solid to a gas without passing
[SPEAKER_00]: through the intermediate liquid phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's solid directly to gas would be
sublimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does occur in nature when ice on snow
from the Earth's surface changes to water
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor in the air without first melting
into water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a unique concept tends to occur a
little bit more commonly in kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Midwestern part of the United States,
going right from solid ice or snow
[SPEAKER_00]: directly to water vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opposite of sublimation, the gas
directly to a solid is called deposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where water vapor changes
directly into ice, such as snowflakes,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the curing process with a cannabis,
a vacuum pump is used to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure, which changes the sublimation
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we're able to achieve those
points by changing the pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's controlled heat added to
convert the frozen moisture directly into
[SPEAKER_00]: water vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very controlled process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're using those kind of
cryogenic freezer desiccals to aid in
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then capturing that water vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with controlled systems, the water
vapor would be captured as ice to help
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure no terpenes are lost in the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes will have to be used as
alternate products, not dry flour,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as vapes or oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a way to ensure there's no
loss by condensing down that water vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any terpenes that were caught in that
water vapor can then be captured and used
[SPEAKER_00]: in other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not being wasted as part of the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then lastly, that final dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the process, the temperature is
raised to 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is when the water content is removed
and it offers the growers the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust the amount of final moisture
content that remains.
[SPEAKER_00]: With controlled systems, this water
content is under the grower's regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're allowed to go through and test
and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're looking at an example of a
dry trim here between eight and 10%
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture, but whatever the grower desires,
they can kind of dial that in during the
[SPEAKER_00]: final drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this might be something a little
bit more applicable to large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, but this cryogenic freezing is
being applied to cannabis more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this gives you a little
insight into it if you want to consider it
[SPEAKER_00]: for your operation, or at least if you're
aware of it, if you hear it mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
