[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over
calculating bullet trajectory and also
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the factors to consider the impact
trajectory and run you through one mock
[SPEAKER_00]: example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, when I say there's many
factors, here's just an example of some
[SPEAKER_00]: factors that can be taken into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an online kind of mathematical
graph calculator, I should say,
[SPEAKER_00]: that will calculate some of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you want to be thinking about the drag
function, the way the bullet, the
[SPEAKER_00]: velocity, the shooting angle, the wind
speed, the wind angle as things as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an example of the graph
generated based on that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that kind of parabola like
angle of travel here, path of travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking here, what I've done is a
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the left again, we see the 22 and
the right here we see the 50 cal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now very similar kind of methods of
travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the shape, it looks very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we look closer, there are
some distinct differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the initial velocity on the
22 is 1,280 feet per second, where on the
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 cal here, it's 2,820 feet per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look closely at the numbers,
while the shape may look very similar,
[SPEAKER_00]: here we're kind of dropping down negative
20 feet, somewhere around about 400 yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here when we reach the negative
feet, we're looking for about 1,000 yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the distance of travel is greatly
impacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most factors are considered to be the
same as far as environmental factors go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the bullet weight is only 40
grams for the 22, 750 grams for the 50
[SPEAKER_00]: cal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is just an example of great
differences that can occur, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: the general path or the general shape of
the path may be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now getting into this trajectory,
two reference points are needed to define
[SPEAKER_00]: the trajectory of a bullet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The path the bullet travels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're gonna be looking at the
impact of a bullet with a passenger or a
[SPEAKER_00]: driver, in this case of a car,
coming through the windshield and
[SPEAKER_00]: impacting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, two reference points are
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do you go about getting those
points?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you look at the way that the hole
is made and you can kind of develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: line, that is a great way to get those two
reference points, especially if it passes
[SPEAKER_00]: through two areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: These reference points can be bullet holes
in the object or the victim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the entry point or exit point from the
victim can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it came in one way and went out the
other way, those again can be two points.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it came in the windshield and impacted
the person, those can be also considered
[SPEAKER_00]: two points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gunshot residue or spent cartridge casings
can be less specific reference points,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still as an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Investigators can use lasers to trace a
straight line path to help determine the
[SPEAKER_00]: position of the shooter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're gonna be
calculating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're looking at calculating
trajectory, this is gonna be a simplified
[SPEAKER_00]: version.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at a impact with a driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have the path of bullet,
we have the windshield.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the building 60 feet away or 720
inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The distance from the window to the bullet
is 23.9 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horizontal distance from the window to the
bullet entrance point is 23.5 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's kind of zoom in and take a look
at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically looking at triangles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we know is the distance along the
horizontal to the window was 23.5 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the distance along the path of the
bullet window was 23.9 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes this little right triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the building is 720 inches away
and the distance was converted to inches
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep all the units the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we wanna know is C is the distance
from here all the way to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the distance from the shooter to
the bullet entrance point?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we go about calculating that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of have the two sides of this
triangle and that's gonna be very
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take those two sides and we've got
23.9 over 23.5 is the same as or
[SPEAKER_00]: proportional to the distance of C,
this distance, over 720.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this allows us now to calculate what C
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go through 720 times 23.9 divided by
23.5, we'll get a C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And C is determined to be 732.3 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we wanna figure out now,
we have this distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wanna figure out what the height of the
shooter is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for this side of this larger
triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna go back to, we may
remember way back when, when you used the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pythagorean Theorem.
[SPEAKER_00]: A squared plus B squared equals C squared
to determine this because this is a right
[SPEAKER_00]: triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now calculating bullet trajectory,
what's the height of the shooter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's our distance now,
here's our building distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to simply go through and
calculate A squared plus B squared equals
[SPEAKER_00]: C squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're looking to find is B squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got 720 squared plus what's gonna
be B squared is gonna equal 732.3 squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go through and calculate that
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go through, we add those, we square those,
then we subtract them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get B squared, this distance squared
equals 17,900.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go through and take the square root of
that and B will be 133 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the height of the shooter for B?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it would be 133 inches.
