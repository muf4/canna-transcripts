[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at the animal phylum
platyhale minties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Platyhale minties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a mouthful to say there,
and I do my best to kind of give you an
[SPEAKER_00]: indication of how to pronounce that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll refer to the video as kind of solid
or flatworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very simple, but we're getting slightly
more complex if you're watching these
[SPEAKER_00]: videos in sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, solid or flatworms,
they have bilateral symmetry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this body symmetry differs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bilateral symmetry means that only
one plane can cut through the organism in
[SPEAKER_00]: half to produce mirror images.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the example here of the
butterfly, and here also of the fern.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is bilateral symmetry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a distinct left and right half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same here, a distinct left and right half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these flatworms have this type of
symmetry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different than some of the organisms we
talked about previously, this allows for a
[SPEAKER_00]: greater degree of specialization to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, radial versus bilateral symmetry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, radial symmetry, regular
arrangement of parts around the central
[SPEAKER_00]: axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: With these having evidence of bilateral
symmetry, they have distinct right and
[SPEAKER_00]: left halves to form the mirror image.
[SPEAKER_00]: With these right and left halves,
we have a little bit more detail we can go
[SPEAKER_00]: into when we're talking about an animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to talk about dorsal versus
ventral.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are terms I'm going to use when we
get into body systems also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dorsal side versus the ventral
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dorsal side, you can see the fishes up
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, think of the dorsal fin of a
dolphin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ventral is the underside here,
and that's the ventral side of the fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anterior and posterior.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anteriors towards the head,
prosteriors towards the tail in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be the anterior portion
here, and this would be the posterior
[SPEAKER_00]: portion here where the tail is located.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just, again, some key terms you should
be familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solid and flatworms, bilateral symmetry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bilateral symmetry produces these
three embryonic layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mesozoans is the three different types of
layers we're going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now initially, they might sound a little
kind of weird, but I think it makes sense
[SPEAKER_00]: once you understand the terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ectoderm will develop on the outer
coverings of the body and nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecto means external.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exterior, you can kind of think of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mesoderm will develop the skeleton and
muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the middle layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mesoderm referring to middle layer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I referred it here to the human body in
hopes it'd make a little bit better
[SPEAKER_00]: connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that ectoderm, the outer body
coverings, think of that like our skin
[SPEAKER_00]: cells of our epidermis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mesoderm is those skeleton and muscles in
our middle part, and endoderm,
[SPEAKER_00]: the internal layer, develops into
digestive organs, such as our intestines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while these three layers will still
exist for solid and flatworms,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though they don't have these complex
systems, hopefully connecting them to
[SPEAKER_00]: these common body systems that you're
familiar with will help you remember ectos
[SPEAKER_00]: on the outside, mesos in the middle,
and endos on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, solid and flatworms are the
simplest of all bilateral symmetrical
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, they're more complex than what
we've talked about so far, but overall
[SPEAKER_00]: they are the most simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like any internal cavity,
other than the digestive tract,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are the simplest animal in which
organs are found.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are called acylamates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is their gut region.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is their ectoderm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's their mesoderm here, and their
endoderm would be their gut, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very simple here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a real-world image of what they
look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most flatworms are parasitic, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are free living, and flatworms range
inside from less than a millimeter to many
[SPEAKER_00]: meters long.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here's like a tapeworm,
extremely long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others are very, very teeny-tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solid and flatworms, they have actually
gone through a process called degenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parasitic flatworms or lifestyles resulted
in the eventual loss of features not used
[SPEAKER_00]: or needed by the parasite.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, parasite flatworms don't need
eye spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The loss of features that lack adaptive
purpose for a parotism is often called
[SPEAKER_00]: degenerative evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of them as like gaining features and
then not using them, and then kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: losing them over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of evolution kind of going
backwards, simply because those
[SPEAKER_00]: advancements are not needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example, a close-up of a
tapeworm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tapeworms are a classic example of this
degenerative evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body of the tapeworm has been reduced
to two primary functions, simply eating
[SPEAKER_00]: and reproducing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need any other specialized
features.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just consuming food, and they're
reproducing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a little bit of how they look in
the inside of a body inside an intestine
[SPEAKER_00]: system here, and then a close-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, solid and flatworms have an
incomplete gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means flatworms have a digestive
cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an incomplete gut with only one
opening, so hopefully you're not eating
[SPEAKER_00]: during this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gut branches throughout the body,
as you see here, and it's involved in both
[SPEAKER_00]: digestion of food particles and also the
excretion of waste out of the same area.
[SPEAKER_00]: These parasitic flatworms lack a gut
entirely and absorb food directly through
[SPEAKER_00]: their body walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a simple system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lack a circulatory system,
and all the cells must be within diffusion
[SPEAKER_00]: distance of oxygen in food.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why they're flat, that great
surface area-to-volume ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a very basic and simple nervous
system also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-living forms have eye spots,
as you see here, that can distinguish
[SPEAKER_00]: light from dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's inaccurate to call these eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just eye spots, because they're
just something light or dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly here, gastrovascular cavity is not
a complete digestive system.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the flatworm, it has a gastrovascular
cavity with one opening that serves both a
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth and an anus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The excretory system is made up of these
tubes connected, and every system is
[SPEAKER_00]: composed of interconnected nerve cords
running the length of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, it's very simple though.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get that food from the central gut
region to any of its cells, they all have
[SPEAKER_00]: to be within diffusion distance for that
to occur.
