[SPEAKER_00]: On this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to go over outdoor site
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluation, keeping in mind if you want to
have that site for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into outdoor site
evaluation for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, there's five main
evaluation kind of standpoints here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to look at the history,
visual, physical, chemical, and regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluation of any site that you might be
considering.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of these are more important than the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all kind of should go through and go
through the evaluation process and make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that you meet all of those proper
evaluation standpoints so that you're able
[SPEAKER_00]: to go into a field knowing you have all
these, at least passing all these
[SPEAKER_00]: checkpoints, because there'll be plenty
challenges growing outdoors in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, the history evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're talking about the history
evaluation, well, what was the site used
[SPEAKER_00]: for before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it dairy farming?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's likely to be high in phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it industrial applications?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any potential contaminants to
consider?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it a hay field?
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH might need to be corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it available?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other questions just to ask there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is someone just abandoning the farm or are
they abandoning it because it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: productive for them?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just kind of that history,
things you can ask about, looking back at
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of what it was used for, and have an
idea of what you might be walking into,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least what you should maybe have a
little indication of what you spend a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more time reviewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we take the simple visual evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the most basic and should be
preferred via a simple computer search and
[SPEAKER_00]: also a simple on-site look.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's great satellite imageries,
so you can find a quick visual inspection
[SPEAKER_00]: of what's going on, and hopefully you can
go there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you do make it out to the field or
have an option to make it out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: field, it's good to make the evaluation
after a recent rainstorm because you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to have an idea of how it may drain or
where water might be flowing to or from
[SPEAKER_00]: within a field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what plant species are currently
growing when you make that visual
[SPEAKER_00]: inspection?
[SPEAKER_00]: Things you should be asking yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it many weed species?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it very disturbed soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it wetland species?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is likely a wet soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be poor for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any inconsistencies do you notice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there empty pockets within the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be since prior usage could be
spills in an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes there's empty spots or rocks,
or you see a lot of rocks kind of on the
[SPEAKER_00]: side or even within the field because this
could make cultivation quite difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going through a physical
evaluation of the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the topography like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it very hilly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that could be a sign of possible
soil erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you notice any rocks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you notice any large rocks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because cultivation could be a challenge
for weed control or even just initial
[SPEAKER_00]: planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, do you know what the soil type is?
[SPEAKER_00]: How well will it allow root aeration to
occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there any ponding that you notice
in any areas?
[SPEAKER_00]: A poor drainage can be a continual
challenge and result in plant stunting,
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly as we see here in this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if it's one little pocket,
one little area, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you see a lot of this occurring,
that could be a reds flag there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, then we get into the chemical
evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking a soil test of the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the soil test say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at, after we pass all the other
kind of steps, take a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to do as you're also doing the
visual inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be advised to get a full soil
test done that looks for far more than
[SPEAKER_00]: just nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you interested in the soil test
on this potential field?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, consider the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the organic matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Soluble salts, particle distribution,
and possible contaminants such as lead and
[SPEAKER_00]: aluminum for sure is what I'd be checking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many labs perform those tests
normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a good idea to get a good
evaluation of the soil, good chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluation to have an idea of while it may
look good, what does the kind of chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: profile that soil test suggest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it also gets into well,
what amendments might you be looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: adding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into lastly here, the
regulatory evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if a field completely checks out,
growers should look into specific town
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be highly variable from one town
to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So questions you should ask, can you build
a structure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good for cold frame construction,
especially for early season propagation,
[SPEAKER_00]: something to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any setbacks for cannabis production?
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes there are road or neighbor
setback requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: How far do you need to be from other
areas?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's also some distances greater for
public property, such as a school,
[SPEAKER_00]: if that's nearby, something else to be
considering looking at those zoning
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then fencing or signage requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your town require a physical barrier
or is signage required?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, what must state and how large does
it need to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: And just be aware of all of these things
ahead of time, because one thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna be a lot of work to kind of go
through and purchase an area or rent an
[SPEAKER_00]: area, but you want to make sure that it
all checks out at least from all these
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of evaluation standpoints so that you
can try to focus on the actual growing
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect and don't have to worry about any
of these potential barriers preventing you
[SPEAKER_00]: from doing what you planned originally on
doing for your cannabis production.
