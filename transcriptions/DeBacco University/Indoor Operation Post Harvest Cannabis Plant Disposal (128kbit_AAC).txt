[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
we're going to go over the post-harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant disposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a little bit more than just beyond
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to consider about some of the
supporting equipment that it takes to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant indoors and how are we best going
to dispose of that to think about this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole production process in a sustainable
manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over indoor operations
post-harvest cannabis plant disposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, disposal of the actual plant
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here per the EPA, cannabis
waste must also be made unusable and
[SPEAKER_00]: unrecognizable before disposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mixed with at least 50% non-cannabis waste
such as non-consumable solids and stored
[SPEAKER_00]: in a secured waste receptacle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis waste can be disposed of in a
permanent landfill or through composting
[SPEAKER_00]: incineration or by means of in-vessel
digestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are landfill options which most
cannabis growers and processors are
[SPEAKER_00]: shipping cannabis waste to landfills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's under federal scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Composting is a goal to provide optimal
conditions for microbial metabolism to
[SPEAKER_00]: help kind of break down that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incineration is this must occur at
temperatures that are high enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy the toxic organic components and
in the hazardous waste as well as reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the overall volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that this is not the same as burning
the leaves in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incineration is a much more directed and
controlled process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's in-vessel digestion which is
a more efficient method of composting
[SPEAKER_00]: wherein the waste is confined within a
building, container or vesicle in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanically control airflow, temperature,
moisture, and odors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with indoor growing, we also want to
be mindful and considerate of the
[SPEAKER_00]: containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers will reuse containers but
this can potentially carry over diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: from one crop to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep this in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers do need to find a method of
disposal of their containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the size, use, and location,
they may want to buy homeowners or donate
[SPEAKER_00]: to community garden settings depending on
the size that you're using and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense that you could buy fresh every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at disposal of the substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the substrate that is used will impact
the disposal method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this mix is the easiest to dispose of
as it has more universal applications so
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be used in more secondary
situations and can even be added to
[SPEAKER_00]: compost operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwell is more difficult to dispose of
and simply typically sadly ends up in a
[SPEAKER_00]: dumpster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this soilless mix, we're going to take
a quick step outside so we can see kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: a kind of harvest that went through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this mix that's left with our that was
grown in our containers for our cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and kind of how that looks on a
relatively small growing operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a jump outside and we'll
come back inside and discuss some other
[SPEAKER_00]: methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when setting up an indoor grow
operation, we want to take into account
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire growing season and what you're
going to be doing with the plants overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just show some examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some containers have been harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see kind of what's left over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hoped to be composted out of some
other amendments and kind of reworked
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for a crop coming in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that just shows you kind of that
look looking at that disposal method when
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to consider the substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want to be mindful of in our
indoor operations the lights that are
[SPEAKER_00]: required.
[SPEAKER_00]: So know the materials that are in the
bulbs because many times they contain
[SPEAKER_00]: mercury in other materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see a whole collection of bulbs
here, single ended, double ended.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that they cannot simply be
disposed of in the trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to drop them off at proper
hazardous waste facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just throw them in the trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, on larger operations with a lot
of lights, we also want to be concerned of
[SPEAKER_00]: the ballasts themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure you're disposing of this properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times they fit great and
containers can be picked up as a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: collection or sometimes hazardous waste
locations have certain drop off times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could bring the lights or used bulbs
and lights too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have disposal lastly of the plant
support materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And regardless of the method used,
plants will often need some form of
[SPEAKER_00]: support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some use trellis netting or stakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can be reused in some cases,
but this is more common with stakes as
[SPEAKER_00]: they will go through a soak of some kind
of sterilization step before they are
[SPEAKER_00]: reused.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be using the same stakes
in the sense you could carry over insects,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could carry over disease, all threats
to your future growing areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to have a sterilization step
unless you're buying new each and every time.
