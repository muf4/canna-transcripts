[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're going to be applying the
transgenic concept, or genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering, to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the same ideas and concepts apply
to animals as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants tend to be a little bit more
simpler in their organization,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's a little bit easier to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here, with corn plants being grown,
this corn seed is a transgenic plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a GMO, genetically modified organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says on the bag here, herbicide
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a gene that's been inserted
into this particular corn seed to allow
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmer to apply a particular herbicide
and to kill the weeds, but not the host
[SPEAKER_00]: plant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look in general here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transgenic plants, genes from one organism
being transferred to a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since DNA is nearly universal,
this is possible because DNA, regardless
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's a human, a jellyfish, a corn
plant, a palm tree, all contain the
[SPEAKER_00]: universal code allowing this to transfer
and change transgenic to move genes from
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to animals or from one plant to
another plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we comment DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant cells read the DNA sequence just
like it was a normal sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just reading along, and A is adenine,
G is guanine, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just reading it right along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we comment DNA or we insert genes,
you can see here our EcoR1 site,
[SPEAKER_00]: our restriction enzyme, and we insert a
gene of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just goes along and reads that plasmid
just as normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't read it as anything different
or foreign because it's the same universal
[SPEAKER_00]: code regarded across all organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how to make a transgenic plant,
kind of the simple and easy steps here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step one, find a gene of interest in an
organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example would be an insect resistance
bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our enzymes, our BT,
Bacillus thuringiensis is a very common
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a gene inserted into corn expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's our promoter region,
here's our plasmid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting those foreign genes into the
corn cell genome and we grow GM corn,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically modified corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the key part here is to find a
transgenic plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make it worth our while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to find a gene that's of interest
from an organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't think you realize how
difficult this initial step is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds really easy, but finding that
gene of interest is literally like finding
[SPEAKER_00]: a needle in a haystack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to identify and isolate the
correct gene or the specific gene that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is human chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chromosome nine contains 136 million
base pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just one of the chromosomes
that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So identifying exactly the location and
where that gene is and splicing that gene
[SPEAKER_00]: out is a very difficult and time consuming
and kind of expensive process,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just because it's possible,
I don't think it's really easy to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and just pull a gene out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does take quite a bit of research to be
able to identify that and where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: located.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to make a transgenic plant,
an alternate route to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of trying to find the gene,
often we want that gene to make a protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a certain protein product
that's the goal, it may be possible to
[SPEAKER_00]: work backwards in the genetic sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Begin with the end in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through reverse transcriptase,
it's an enzyme that generates DNA from
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA, we can work backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here we have our protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking our protein and we're here
working our way backwards, we can generate
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from RNA, we can work backwards and
generate DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can be one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because our concern here is the end
protein, we don't necessarily care about
[SPEAKER_00]: this exact DNA sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get a DNA sequence that will match
that particular protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember back from our translation and
transcription, there's different DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences, remember codons for amino
acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a potential for many different
DNA sequences to generate the same
[SPEAKER_00]: protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there will be very specific lengths
and needs and organization of those
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleotides to generate that specific
protein that we want to produce with our
[SPEAKER_00]: transgenic plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So complementary DNA formation,
which is lowercase c DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Primary RNA transcript contains exons and
introns.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process of mRNA contains only exons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you remember that from our
previous lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used as a template to create a single
strand of DNA termed complementary DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This c DNA is converted to a double
stranded molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of trying to work our way
backwards here from our end protein
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reverse transcriptase is an enzyme used
to generate complementary DNA from an RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: template.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, it's kind of going backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's called reverse
transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mainly associated with retroviruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we learned back when we did DNA and RNA
talked a little bit about viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viruses can be DNA based or RNA based.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're RNA based, they want to go back
in through reverse transcriptase and those
[SPEAKER_00]: are called retroviruses, not viruses from
the 70s, but viruses that are made or have
[SPEAKER_00]: the main sequence in RNA that need to go
through the process of reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription to generate that DNA to
redirect the cell that's trying to impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to make a transgenic plant,
we developed a cloning vector,
[SPEAKER_00]: plasmids in which small segment of DNA is
produced independently from the main
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little circular plasmids remember from our
prokaryotes, our bacteria cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that vector that we're looking at
having our gene of interest inserted in
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what we want to replicate and
replicate very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli can multiply itself every 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plasmids can replicate very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step three is to cut the main DNA and
vector with the same resource restriction
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme so the sticky ends can join.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have the HINDI3 gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're cutting our main genome as well as
our gene of interest so they can bind
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will incorporate the vector into the
main sequence of DNA, be able to replicate
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those sticky ends are areas that want to
join together and they're cut with the
[SPEAKER_00]: same restriction enzyme so it's the same
ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, we can cut this original host
plasmid, put our little gene of interest
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and seal it back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cell's just going to read it as
normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here original strand,
strand one and strand two are circular
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once incorporated, the key now is
replication of that sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want those cells to multiply as quickly
as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want those plasmids to go through and
make two and exponentially multiply from
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see our plasmids and replication is
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could also integrate our plasmid into
our host DNA sequence and multiply that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step five here, we're taking our gene of
interest and making it into tDNA or
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sequence and inserting into
independent plant's chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does occur in naturalists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to think this is a
completely foreign process in
[SPEAKER_00]: agrobacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gram-negative bacterium that use
horizontal gene transfer to cause tumors
[SPEAKER_00]: or galls in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, if you walk in the woods,
you might see a tree that has these galls,
[SPEAKER_00]: these weird growths on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because they've been infected with
agrobacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it will look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also occur on roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a type of bacterium called
agrobacterium that causes plant diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: such as crown gall and hairy root that
results in plant death and agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: loss because this kind of mass of cells
resembles, you could say to some extent,
[SPEAKER_00]: some similarities could be drawn to like a
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In agrobacterium, the ability to infect
the plant is contained within a gene in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plasmid that's transferred from one
bacteria to another through a process of
[SPEAKER_00]: this conjugation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this gall that forms, it's reducing the
surface area to volume ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, in the roots, not allowing
these roots to be as efficiently absorbed
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go through the major
details of this, but this does provide
[SPEAKER_00]: some background information.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a plant cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our agrobacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bacterium, what's very unique about
it, it is able to take its genes or
[SPEAKER_00]: certain genes from it in its own plasmid
and insert it into a host cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has ways of bypassing a lot of the
regulatory mechanisms that, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant cell has.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this transfection by agrobacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've done through our process of
biotechnology is replicating this same
[SPEAKER_00]: basic idea or, in some cases, having the
agrobacterium take that gene of interest
[SPEAKER_00]: and have the agrobacterium be the one that
inserts it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's, again, a quick plant genetic
modification summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It mirrors a lot of the general genetic
biotech that we talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking our plasmid, our foreign DNA,
cutting it with our restriction enzymes
[SPEAKER_00]: with our sticky ends, adjoining it here,
mass multiplying it, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: taking our original cells using
agrobacterium to insert the gene of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest, having a way to screen,
select for the cells that have our gene of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest, and then growing a plant from
that that will then produce the particular
[SPEAKER_00]: protein that we're interested in.
