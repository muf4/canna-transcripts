[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this DeBacco University video,
we're going to be looking at some planting
[SPEAKER_00]: specifics stated for cannabis,
particularly autoflowers planted outdoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: to give you some guidelines or some
direction if you're looking at planting
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to know some specifics about
planting autoflower cannabis outdoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the video for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, autoflower clones, keep in mind is as
a reminder that since autoflowers are
[SPEAKER_00]: based on days old, there are no clones
available, so growers must use seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have autoflower clones,
probably that can be the best thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at planting autoflowers
in particular, definitely want to focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to seeds, I would advise
feminized seed because while the field
[SPEAKER_00]: should still be scouted for male plants,
starting with feminized seeds will help
[SPEAKER_00]: vastly reduce the number of male plants to
reduce the amount of wasted time on these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that are not going to produce your
end desired product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If non-feminist or dioecious seed is used,
more than 50% of the plant started with
[SPEAKER_00]: can be male, reducing field densities by
half.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ideally be a 50-50 split male to
females, but that's really going to
[SPEAKER_00]: basically cut your field in half while
still keeping your area and expenses at
[SPEAKER_00]: full.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how long from the seed to harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be variety dependent,
but be sure to check with the specific
[SPEAKER_00]: type that you're planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the typical range for
autoflowers, to give you an idea,
[SPEAKER_00]: would be 68 to 95 days, with 75 days being
the average.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, check with the specific purchase
seeds that you have, check with whoever's
[SPEAKER_00]: supplying you the seeds to get an idea of
the duration of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, autoflowers again will not be
dependent on photo period, simple days can
[SPEAKER_00]: be counted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many plants per acre?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in typical plant densities are about
11,000 to 18,000 plants per acre,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to give you a general idea for these
autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they give you some kind of idea what
the size of an acre is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 60% of a soccer field here,
or about 16 tennis courts in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the suggested plant spacing when
we're looking at autoflowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the plant spacing, here we can see
some different scenarios provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: If planting in rows, this would equate to
about 222 plants in 100 feet by five foot
[SPEAKER_00]: bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a one row and a 30 inch
bed, three rows and a 60 inch bed,
[SPEAKER_00]: or two rows and a 60 inch bed,
this can give you idea, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plants per acre that you'll be
looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important to know because this is
going to depend how many seeds you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be looking at purchasing,
and kind of the area or plant matter that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be producing in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the 12 inches apart in a row,
16 or 18 inches apart, you could see how
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to vary the amount of plants
you're going to have per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now autoflowers, as a reminder again,
are not photo period dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since autoflowers will flower based on
days old, this can offer growers some more
[SPEAKER_00]: flexibility when it comes to planting day.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the climate and frost free days
should be the driving force when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to selecting your growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to try to maximize the best
growing days, even if it's not looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the longest necessarily or transition from
longest to shorter days of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, autoflowers will produce
smaller plants and typically smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they make up for this with
growing very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they cannot be cloned.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not require pruning or training,
so that can be a labor savings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're thought to be more resilient
to stressful growing conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though that could be kind of variety
dependent there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's smaller plants, but they're
quicker to turn around time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in areas with a longer growing season,
this may afford growers the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow two plant cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though most of the time for outdoor
growing, you're looking at one growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle, particularly in areas that have
colder climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure you're timing that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at flower biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much yield are we going to get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in general, biomass based on
categories, the average would be about
[SPEAKER_00]: that 2,150 pounds to the acre,
and then below average and above average
[SPEAKER_00]: information given there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're wondering about where to get
some more information or where do these
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers came from, in the description,
you'll see a link to the sources that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're welcome to go investigate further.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully this will provide you with a
starting point for at least autoflowers to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you some sense of, you know,
what you should be looking at if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at outdoor field planting of
autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
