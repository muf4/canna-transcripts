[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to investigate arthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while this is a general term that you
may have heard of before, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: focus in this video lecture on two main
different types of classifications under
[SPEAKER_00]: the large branch of arthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, arthritis is an
inflammatory and degenerative disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than 100 different types of
inflammatory or degenerative diseases that
[SPEAKER_00]: damage joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arthritis is the most widespread and
crippling disease in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Symptoms are pain, stiffness, and swelling
of the joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acute forms are caused by bacteria and
treated with antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to keep in mind that
while we have this general term,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's actually a lot of subsets and a lot
of different types of arthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what works for one person may not work
for another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two chronic forms that we're going to
focus on here are include osteoarthritis
[SPEAKER_00]: and rheumatoid arthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with osteoarthritis, which I'll
abbreviate O, capital O, capital A,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the most common chronic arthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often called the wear and tear
arthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It affects women more than men.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 85% of all Americans will develop
some form of osteoarthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more prevalent with the age and
elderly and it's probably related to
[SPEAKER_00]: normal aging process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to give you an idea of what a
normal hip joint would look nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: smooth on that cartilage there allowing
these gliding motions between these two
[SPEAKER_00]: bones articulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have exposed bones and we have
that breakdown of that worn cartilage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of osteoarthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The course of an osteoarthritis,
again we see a picture of a nice normal
[SPEAKER_00]: knee, nice smooth, shiny look,
and osteoarthritis, that breaking down of
[SPEAKER_00]: that cartilage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Osteoarthritis reflects the years of
abrasion and compression that's caused by
[SPEAKER_00]: increased production of a maloprotonase
enzyme that breaks down cartilage.
[SPEAKER_00]: As one ages, cartilage is destroyed more
quickly than it's replaced.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exposure of bone ends thicken,
enlarge, form bone spurs, and restrict
[SPEAKER_00]: movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joints most affected are cervical and
lumbar spine, fingers, knuckles,
[SPEAKER_00]: knees, and hips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of see the purple regions
located here are areas that tend to be
[SPEAKER_00]: most affected by osteoarthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treatment for this particular issue,
sadly this is a slow progression and also
[SPEAKER_00]: irreversible disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some potential treatments and
they include mild pain relievers,
[SPEAKER_00]: magnetic therapy potentially, glucosamine
sulfate decreases pain and inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In extreme cases, you may have known
someone that's gone through what's called
[SPEAKER_00]: joint replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually replacing a portion of
that joint and removing that damaged area
[SPEAKER_00]: and replacing it with, in this case,
usually a titanium or some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic product.
[SPEAKER_00]: To replace that joint with.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example here we see total knee
replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be an example of the femur or
hip replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also occur in small areas such as
fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rheumatoid arthritis is the other type and
this is abbreviated RA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this chronic inflammation autoimmune
disease of unknown cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually this occurs between the ages of 40
and 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it may occur at any age.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're seeing in this image here are
normal joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that nice smooth appearance and
here we're seeing that joint affected by
[SPEAKER_00]: rheumatoid arthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still losing cartilage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have bone loss, all other
negatives that could occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Signs and symptoms include joint
tenderness, osteoporosis, muscle atrophy,
[SPEAKER_00]: cardiovascular problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these can be related to rheumatoid
arthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The course of rheumatoid arthritis is
marked with exacerbations and remissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of this boom and bust.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part here that is an autoimmune
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: The course begins with the inflammation of
synovial membranes at the affected joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inflammation of blood cells migrate to the
joint causing swelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The end result, we could produce deformed
fingers in extreme cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, because this is an autoimmune
disease, the immune system is involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have B cells and T cells of our
immune system being brought to the ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this reaction that's basically
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: This occurs in rheumatoid arthritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we return to arthritis and treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different potential options.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's conservative therapies such as
aspirin or long-term antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's progressive treatments for
anti-inflammatory drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some other biological response
modifiers that neutralize the harmful
[SPEAKER_00]: properties of those inflammatory
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because it's autoimmune, different
things may work better for different
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now comparing the two, rheumatoid to
osteoarthritis, it's a great chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tries to put some of the features in a
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Age of onset, rheumatoid can happen at any
age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Osteoarthritis usually later in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rheumatoid's a very rapid onset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Osteo is a very slow, occurs over years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's autoimmune, it can occur
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joints affected, duration, and kind of
your symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Osteoarthritis, because it's not an
autoimmune disease, because the immune
[SPEAKER_00]: system's not involved, there's really no
systemic symptoms involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, rheumatoid arthritis may come
about with fatigue, fever, and night
[SPEAKER_00]: sweats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just being able to kind of compare some
of the two while they both fall under the
[SPEAKER_00]: classification of arthritis, you can see
there's some clear and distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: differences between these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just kind of the two chronic
ones I chose to compare for the purpose of
[SPEAKER_00]: this video lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
