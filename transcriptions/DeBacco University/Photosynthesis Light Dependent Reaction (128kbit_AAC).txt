[SPEAKER_00]: So this video is going to be
photosynthesis, light-dependent reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that in the description
there's a link to these slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video I'm going to attempt to
describe this mess in front of you here on
[SPEAKER_00]: the title slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now it may not make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully by the end, or maybe you'll be
watching this video a couple times,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll begin to understand some of the
complexities here, and it won't seem so
[SPEAKER_00]: daunting as it does right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving on, our light-dependent
reaction, there's protein complexes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found another great link to some
animations here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at photosystem II,
plastoquinin, cytochrome, photosystem I,
[SPEAKER_00]: ferredoxin, and ATP synthase are some of
the protein complexes we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: discussing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to help you to understand
what's going on through this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that while this might seem
very complex, we are all dealing with the
[SPEAKER_00]: chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chloroplast here, keep in mind the
stroma is that aqueous liquid,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the thylakoid lumen is that inner
portion here of the disc, and it shows it
[SPEAKER_00]: right here also.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be looking at explaining
what's going on right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so to start with, let's look at an
exploded view here of the light-dependent
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction, just an overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: For photosystem II, excited electron
travels along a series of proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This electron transport system uses energy
from the electron to pump hydrogen ions
[SPEAKER_00]: across the membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the inner thylakoid, this is our
thylakoid space.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pigment molecule, photosystem I,
accepts an electron, and we're using ATP
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase here to generate ADP into ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to follow this electron along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, this is a chain because it only
occurs in one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with first, photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, photo meaning light, we're looking
at a photon of light energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wavelength of light, that's the source of
the initial energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see our white light here getting
separated out by our prism into our
[SPEAKER_00]: different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice those colors have different
wavelengths, and they occur always in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same regi-biv order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, keep in mind this is visible
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking here at other forms of
different wavelengths here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visible light is a very small portion of
the electromagnetic spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a wonderful rainbow,
it's a double rainbow here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is given off when an electron jumps
down one of its levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So photosystem II, now keep in mind that
we do start with photosystem II.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's photosystem I that comes later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosystem I was first discovered,
and actually then they found this other
[SPEAKER_00]: photosystem, so this is why it's labeled
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But photosystem II is what we're going to
start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light energy is absorbed by the
chlorophyll molecule and passed along a
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway to other chlorophyll molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: The energy in this molecule, chlorophylls,
found in the reaction center, this energy
[SPEAKER_00]: excites one of its electrons and leaves a
molecule to be transferred to the nearby
[SPEAKER_00]: primary electron acceptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this electron here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This electron comes from splitting of a
molecule of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see oxygens giving off as a byproduct,
so are hydrogen ions, and an electron,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that electron is absorbing this light
energy and excited, we call it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and jumping up a level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's not just passed off and left to
go and release its energy, it's through a
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence of steps when this electron drops
down in energy, we're going to harness
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our initial electron ground
state, we excite it to the excited state,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're giving it its energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're trying to maximize this energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the thylakoid membrane,
keep in mind where the stroma is or the
[SPEAKER_00]: thylakoid space here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice our phospholipid bilayer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now capturing light energy in the reaction
center, different molecules utilize
[SPEAKER_00]: different wavelengths of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately light energy is channeled to
the reaction center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see our carotenoids here,
chlorophyll B or chlorophyll A,
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing multiple wavelengths of light
energy that the sun is producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you an example of some of this,
it's called an antenna complex,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we see chlorophyll B, beta-carotene
you might be familiar with, it's in
[SPEAKER_00]: carots, lycopens in tomatoes, and we have
our chlorophyll A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that electron is coming from our water
molecule, and this is going to what's
[SPEAKER_00]: called ETS.
[SPEAKER_00]: This electron is going to the electron
transport system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that's a one direction chain like
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We split our water molecules, so we're
getting our oxygen, and we're also getting
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now please remember hydrogen ions,
increasing the amount of hydrogen ions
[SPEAKER_00]: will increase the acidity or decrease the
pH here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these hydrogen ions are located to the
lumen or thylakoid interior, two water
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules result in an oxygen molecule
being released.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that evident here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes two of our H2Os to get our O2
molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at photosystem 2, abbreviated
PS2 or P680, it's absorbing 680 nanometers
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the reaction center that increases
electrons energy to the excited state.
[SPEAKER_00]: This high energy state is unstable,
and the energy level is lowered through
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled sequence of steps, which we're
going to learn about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind and remember that when we
split our water, we're getting hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we notice the pH of our thylakoid
interior is 4, acidic, and our stroma
[SPEAKER_00]: here, the outside, is a pH of 8,
slightly basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: In photosystem 2 is where we start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're initially getting our electron here
from our water, exciting it with
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths of energy from the sun in this
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plastoquinone here, PQ, is how it's
represented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mobile protein, and it's the start
of the electron transport system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It moves within the membrane, within this
lipid bilayer, and ultimately passes the
[SPEAKER_00]: electrons off to the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we excite our electron, we're passing
it here to this mobile carrier,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's carrying this high energy
electron to the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we didn't have this carrier,
this electron would just release its
[SPEAKER_00]: energy randomly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would not be able to be captured and
utilized for the photosynthetic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cytochrome complex, it contains iron,
kind of put a picture here of an iron
[SPEAKER_00]: chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This moves protons or hydrogen ions across
the thylakoid membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this requires energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is active transport, taking this
hydrogen, which is in low concentrations
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and moving it across this barrier,
this phospholipid bilayer, and
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrating it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, remember our pH here is acidic,
pH of 4, and the stroma is a pH of 8,
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's occurring through a constant movement
of those hydrogen ions, also called
[SPEAKER_00]: protons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plastocyanin, this carries electrons from
the cytochrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mobile carrier, you see it's
represented here, and it delivers
[SPEAKER_00]: electrons to photosystem 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a mobile carrier, try to remember
that, we had to put a picture of an
[SPEAKER_00]: aircraft carrier here, mobile carrier,
and we're looking right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've gone through our photosystem 2,
we've primary electron acceptor,
[SPEAKER_00]: plastocyanin, then we're going to our
cytochrome, moving our electrons,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, our hydrogens across with the
energy from the electron, and now we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to photosystem 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in photosystem 1, it's similar to
photosystem 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is photosystem 1 down here,
and this is photosystem 1 for comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: The electron is reenergized from photons
of light energy through the reaction
[SPEAKER_00]: center, and now we're transferring it to
ferredoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives you, it's called P700,
it's a slightly different wavelength of
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here our electron being passed off,
light energy here, exciting that electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice photosystem 1 is simpler than
photosystem 2, because there's no water
[SPEAKER_00]: that's being broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: The electrons that were separated out from
this original water molecule are being
[SPEAKER_00]: passed along, and this is the same
electron being reenergized here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of gives you a graphical
representation of this reenergizing that
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So electrons are energized after absorbing
energy from the light, then as part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: electron transport chain, the energy is
released to a controlled manner and able
[SPEAKER_00]: to perform necessary plant functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens twice with each photosystem
utilizing a different wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see here photosystem 2,
taking our electrons from the initial
[SPEAKER_00]: splitting of water, energizing it up,
passing it down a sequence of steps,
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing it to do work, in this case
moving protons or hydrogen ions,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it reaches photosystem 1,
reenergizes itself with another photon,
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing it up, and then we're going to
utilize those steps again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what we call the energizing
electrons, bringing it up, and then as it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes down, we're kind of controlling and
utilizing that energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pheridoxin, FD, and NADP reductase,
and FNRs were located here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, we're looking at the
thylakoid, look where the stroma is,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've gone through photosystem 2 and the
splitting of water, the reenergizing with
[SPEAKER_00]: light energy, now we're looking at passing
those electrons off, we're moving our
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen ions across, concentrating them
in the lumen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just left photosystem 2 from the
photosystem, absorbing light energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and now we're getting to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're transferring those electrons and a
hydrogen ion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So creating a proton and hydrogen ion
gradient, concentration of hydrogen ions
[SPEAKER_00]: in the lumen increases the acidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, increasing acidity decreases the
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gradient naturally would like to
diffuse across the membrane and even out
[SPEAKER_00]: the concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This generates an energy potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrogen ions though can only pass through
this protein structure called ATP
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, we see our cytochrome here
moving them across.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only allowed to pass back over
through the process of ATP synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as they do move over, ideally with
more energy, the cytochrome will pull
[SPEAKER_00]: these back to try to maintain this
gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what ATP synthase actually is,
hanging out over there, this hydrogen ion
[SPEAKER_00]: gradient generates from the electron
transport chain, and it's used to run ATP
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proton flow results in ADP,
benzene diphosphate, being converted to
[SPEAKER_00]: ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see here our hydrogen ion moving
across.
[SPEAKER_00]: ATP synthase, the reason why I showed this
little animation here, it actually does
[SPEAKER_00]: rotate and turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is converting ADP to ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grabbing another phosphate and
joining it on from diphosphate to
[SPEAKER_00]: triphosphate, our high energy molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Necessary for the cell to perform its
functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now hopefully, looking here, I pose the
question, does this make sense now?
[SPEAKER_00]: And initially I know you're probably gonna
say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is presented a little bit differently,
but I would welcome you to pause the video
[SPEAKER_00]: and take a look at what everything is
labeled and see if you can describe what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at water molecules, our photosystem
two, photosystem one, where the hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: ions are occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately we're generating our NADPH and
our ADP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there's stroma and there are
lumen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind where everything is,
where the electrons are being passed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, pause the video here and see if
you can explain this to yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully after you've explained that,
it makes a little bit more sense now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you may be wondering, all we generated
was ATP, which is the energy component of
[SPEAKER_00]: the reaction, and NADPH, which is the
terminal electron acceptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the electron goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was originally split from the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no sugars were made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when does this happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: When it doesn't create sugars?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the answer is gonna be the Kelvin
cycle, or the light independent reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there'll be other videos on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This entire description here was simply
the light dependent reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while the components ATP and NADPH are
necessary for the Kelvin cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Kelvin cycle itself does not require
light energy directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna be in a subsequent video.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is where we're gonna be using our
CO2, our NADPH, our ATP, and ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll be generating that sugar molecule to
allow there to be stored form of energy in
[SPEAKER_00]: a chemical form that originated from an
energy or light form.
Pause the video here and see if you can
explain that.
