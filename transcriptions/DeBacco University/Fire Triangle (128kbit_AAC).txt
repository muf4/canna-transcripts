[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video
going over the fire triangle, which
[SPEAKER_00]: involves what it takes for a fire to get
started, what all the requirements are to
[SPEAKER_00]: get started, and to keep it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a triangle here because you
need all three sides in order to keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: fire going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking here, that general fire
triangle, what is it composed of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have fuel, we have oxygen,
and we have heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when those all come together,
you'll have fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: These three components are needed for fire
to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need a fuel source, you need the
presence of oxygen, and you also need heat
[SPEAKER_00]: all present together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any one of those aren't present,
the triangle falls apart, and the fire
[SPEAKER_00]: will be extinguished.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that fuel source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it can be quite variable as far
as a fuel source, but fuel is defined as a
[SPEAKER_00]: combustible material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Material can be in any state of matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be solid, liquid, or gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most solids and liquids become vaporized
before they will burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, clothing, plant material,
flammable liquids, all can be considered
[SPEAKER_00]: fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a wood-burning stove,
you have propane, gasoline for your car,
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol, or diesel, even clothing,
these all can be examples of fuel sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it comes to oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a fire requires at least 16% oxygen in
the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Atmospheric oxygen levels are 21%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because a couple oxygen atoms are
present, it's not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have about that 16% of oxygen
in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, again, normal breathing
oxygen is only about 21% oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can have levels below that in order
to keep a fire going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have our heat source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So heat will rise the temperature of the
fuel source to the point of ignition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, depending on the actual fuel source
could depend on the amount of heat that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be needed to keep that going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, that triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That triangle, the reason why it's kind of
that good visual there is all three
[SPEAKER_00]: components must be present at the same
time and space for a fire to result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Removal of any and breaking the triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, there will be no fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at extinguishing or putting
out a fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knocking any one of those three sides of
the triangle out will cause the fire to be
[SPEAKER_00]: extinguished.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, if we're noticing evidence that
there was a fire, we can assume that all
[SPEAKER_00]: three of these components were there to
some degree in order to keep that fire burning.
