[SPEAKER_00]: This video is going to show a
Hardy-Weinberg application involved with
[SPEAKER_00]: sickle cell anemia and why this is not
following what we might expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at sickle cell anemia,
what it is an inherent mutation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic code in hemoglobin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemoglobin, remember, is oxygen curing
blood protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recessive allele is this H with this S
and this double S here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The normal allele would be the B.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this S and this S is standing for
sickle cell anemia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low oxygen levels cause red blood cells to
sickle, which is this kind of shape here,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you see indicated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a normal red blood cell,
maintaining a very high surface area to
[SPEAKER_00]: volume ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the sickle shape is not really the
protein formed in the proper shape,
[SPEAKER_00]: not allowing it to do its proper function.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breaks down to red blood cells,
clogging small blood vessels, damaging
[SPEAKER_00]: organs, can often be lethal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do not want sickle cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It causes a very shortened life
expectancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the alleles for this still exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So high frequency of heterozygotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One in five in central Africans are
heterozygotes for sickle cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a normal allele and also a
sickle cell allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unusual for an allele with severe
detrimental effects in the homozygotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one out of 100 individuals will be
homozygous for sickle cell and they
[SPEAKER_00]: usually die before reproductive age,
meaning these genes are typically not
[SPEAKER_00]: passed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of brings the question of why
is the sickle cell allele maintained in
[SPEAKER_00]: such high levels in African populations?
[SPEAKER_00]: This suggests there's some selective
advantage for being a heterozygo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to investigate that a little
bit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, just a quick general
malaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a parasite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's transmitted by mosquitoes,
causes a bunch of negative symptoms,
[SPEAKER_00]: can often lead to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here, it's a life-stating species that
it goes through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is blood-borne.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does multiply in the human body and
again, transmitted the parasite at least
[SPEAKER_00]: by a mosquito bite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be very deadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a single-celled eukaryotic parasite
spends part of its life cycle in red blood
[SPEAKER_00]: cells and that's what causes here a mass
multiplication that then a mosquito will
[SPEAKER_00]: bite someone who's infected and spread it
to another person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sickle cell anemia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was first detected in December 31st
in 1904.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sickle cell anemia is a hereditary disease
affecting hemoglobin molecules in the
[SPEAKER_00]: blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially you might be asking,
well, how does this relate to the malaria
[SPEAKER_00]: I just talked about?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see how this connects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sickle cell mutation changes the sixth
amino acid in the hemoglobin chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This causes hemoglobin molecules to clump.
[SPEAKER_00]: In normal red blood cells, the hemoglobin
chains do not clump.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sickle cell homozygousy leads to
reduced lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have sickle cell, your red
blood cells are going to look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see the forms long and flexible
chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how hemoglobin should look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can lead to clogging of red blood
cells, blood vessels here, leading to all
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of issues and problems of not being
able to exchange blood efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus if you have normal blood,
you see everything these nice little round
[SPEAKER_00]: red blood cells can move very efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heterozygous though, they produce enough
hemoglobin to keep the red blood cells
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though there is still some sickle
cell, heterozygous have enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: basically keep most of the red blood cells
healthy and allow that individual to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is the defect of the allele still
around then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, if you can survive with it,
it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have the homozygous for sickle
cell, you end up dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this allele still around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why hasn't this been selected again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this disease affects central Africa
of one in 500 Africans, but is almost
[SPEAKER_00]: unknown in other racial groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just draws the question, well,
why?
[SPEAKER_00]: People who are heterozygotes for sickle
cell allele have less susceptibility to
[SPEAKER_00]: malaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of what's called the
heterozygo advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that malaria that I talked about that
lives in the red blood cells, if you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: heterozygo and have one of your alleles
for a sickle cell, you're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to malaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stabilizing selection is just acting
on the sickle cell allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: It occurs because malaria resistant
counterbalances the lethal anemia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in green here, we have the presence of
where malaria tends to be found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have the frequency of the
sickle cell allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: The darker reds are where there's a higher
frequency, up to 10 plus to 12 and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: percent plus, and the lighter regions are
where it's less found.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice if we kind of look at both
of these in comparison, we see that where
[SPEAKER_00]: the sickle cell allele is present is also
areas of the world that malaria is also
[SPEAKER_00]: present.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is referring to that heterozygo
advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in tropical Africa, when malaria is
common, the homozygote dominant normal,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're homozygote for normal,
which is what most people are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would die from malaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're homozygote recessive for sickle
cell, you would die from sickle cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you're a carrier or a
heterozygo, you're relatively free of
[SPEAKER_00]: both.
[SPEAKER_00]: You survive and reproduce more,
and therefore more common in the
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need one of those alleles to carry
normal hemoglobin, and having the other
[SPEAKER_00]: one encoding for sickle cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're where malaria is present,
you actually become basically resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hypothesis is in malaria-infected
cells, the lower oxygen levels is lowered
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to cause sickling, which kills the
cell and destroys the parasite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is this heterozygote carrier in
advantage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's causing the parasites,
breaking the life cycle of the parasite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, to be heterozygote is an
advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall is we still need that sickle
cell gene to be in the population,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's that chance your offspring
could come up with the homozygous for
[SPEAKER_00]: sickle cell and end up dying before
they're able to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, most of the world's normal
hemoglobin, but affected by malaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're this heterozygote, you're able
to have enough normal hemoglobin to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive, but you have a little bit of
reduced effect so that the sickle cell
[SPEAKER_00]: gene would kill and break the life cycle
of the parasite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just an interesting phenomenon that shows
that, tied in with the Hardy-Weinberg,
[SPEAKER_00]: that this does not follow the expected
allele change because of the advantage of
[SPEAKER_00]: the heterozygote.
