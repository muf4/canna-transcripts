[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBacco University video,
we're going to explore the potency of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis grown under LED and HPS lights
based on a scientific article.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a debate that constantly goes
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at some scientific research
and see how this changes the potency of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into this highly
debated subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: LED versus HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, this is the research
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the links provided, fairly
recently published.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to go back to the original
article, here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to kind of break it down and
give you the summary of it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, this is the great debate,
HPS, high pressure sodiums versus LED
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, most people do not consider this
to be a debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feel that LED lights are nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of the wave of the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the old school methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only want to grow under LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of part of that debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to some extent, but let's look at it
from a scientific standpoint here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, this article compared these
different lights here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had one HPS light, the ePapillonian
1000 watt double ended HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they had three LED lights that
they were looking at in comparing here,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all the lights as part of the
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, after their comparison of the LED
lights, then there were only two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kept with the, of course,
high pressure sodium for comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they kept the Fluence Bioengineering,
which is now known by Fluence by Osram,
[SPEAKER_00]: the spider, plus LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first part of the study really was
geared to evaluating leading LED light
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers and models, identify which
option provides the most uniform
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution of the light at the leaf,
at the leaf and canopy, as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: important factor at producing a consistent
end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they wanted a basically the best of the
best for LED lights, at least in their
[SPEAKER_00]: regiments of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of their data collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Fluence by Osram, the spider X plus
model clearly demonstrate optimum light
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution, photosynthetic response,
and also maintain leaf temperature within
[SPEAKER_00]: the optimum range to achieve maximum
photosynthetic rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why they chose that one over the
others, just to go back for a second,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the two others that were presented
here, this ultimately is the LED light
[SPEAKER_00]: that they compare to this high pressure
sodium there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into some of the data here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the most interesting part was
figure four.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this study, all the cannabis cultivars
grown under LED lights yielded an increase
[SPEAKER_00]: of THCA percentage with an average
increase of 5.39%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mean of 25.06% THCA under LED lights
versus only 19.67% under high pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium lights here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it shows you the potency and provided
that yes, LED lights does yield a greater
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, most growers would stop here and
say throughout all their HPS, and go with
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs, but let's just explore this just a
little bit further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what does this generally
mean to the growers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Many growers would think that LED lights
would yield them more THCA, which is when
[SPEAKER_00]: while the study did show that there are,
did show this, there are other factors
[SPEAKER_00]: that must be taken into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: With indoor facilities, there are other
environmental control factors that need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be optimized to ensure quality harvest,
temperature, humidity, of regulating that
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, keeping it within tight
ranges, the intensity of the light,
[SPEAKER_00]: the area that the light covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of other factors that need
to be taken into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just don't think that LED lights is
going to be your only way to get high THCA
[SPEAKER_00]: levels in this example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now THCA in lighting, to break the 30% or
even 35% total THC theoretical barrier,
[SPEAKER_00]: one does not need LED lights as this can
be done with high pressure sodium lights
[SPEAKER_00]: used during flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just understand that 30%, it's kind of
that theoretical barrier, even 35%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing test results that show flower that
does have higher than 30% THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: total THC, and that is they are grown
under HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think you have to have LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: LED lighting, though, can help this,
but all factors must be taken into
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration, especially coverage area
and related PAR readings, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding schedules, as well as stresses and
non-stresses to the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, to prove these total amounts,
we're looking, of course, at getting an
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical report, third party tested so
we know exactly what those values are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for the growers, general
considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep this in mind, that short LED
light technology may be the way of the
[SPEAKER_00]: future, but at the current time taking
into full cost of initially purchasing,
[SPEAKER_00]: ownership, and number of fixtures needed,
HPS is still price competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keeping that in mind, there is a lot of
other factors to consider in a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: LED lights do offer the advantage of being
full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least in some cases, so growers can see
the plants in their true form,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically without the need for any
filtering lenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there may be some beneficial
wavelengths of the light produced that can
[SPEAKER_00]: aid in cannabis plants' ability to produce
certain compounds at greater
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations than grown under other
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this does not mean HPS lights are
useless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if available to growers, they should
still continue to utilize them because we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to consider, yes, we've got a lot of
other factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some more heat, of course,
with HPS lights, but a lot of times to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the full power reading coverage area of a
thousand watt double ended HPS,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may need to purchase more LED
fixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that needs to be kept in mind
there, as well as the other kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: changing over of electrical panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to keep all of those various cost
repairs, maintenance all in mind when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at a grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the general take home message of
this article?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, many companies produce LED lights,
but in general, you want to live by the
[SPEAKER_00]: motto that good LED lights are not cheap
and cheap LED lights are not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS lights can still produce quality
cannabis and for the cost are worth
[SPEAKER_00]: serious consideration by more growers,
not saying that LED lights are bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look at the full costs there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people say, oh, LED lights
run with less wattage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need less cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may be true, but just keep in
mind the mounting heights as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times LED lights do need to be
closer to the plants to be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you increase that spacing,
your coverage area may not be as great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at the full picture when
considering light changes, but if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to HPS lights, don't consider them
to be a horrible option.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be a great option for you to
utilize and may be actually more cost
[SPEAKER_00]: effective in some cases than LED lights.
