[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're looking at resource
partitioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: See just an example here, a variant here,
where we have sunny dry conditions on the
[SPEAKER_00]: left and shady moist conditions on the
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different species that are going
to favor the sunny and dry environment
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the shady and moist environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we call this resource partitioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is formulated in the principle of
competitive exclusion, which states that
[SPEAKER_00]: no two species with the same niche can
coexist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the principle of this competitive
exclusion we see coming up in the example
[SPEAKER_00]: of that here can be restated as no two
species can occupy the same niche
[SPEAKER_00]: indefinitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have the yellow birds occupying
the ground, the trunk of the tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the top portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then these red birds move in and there's
competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we notice now that the yellow birds
are located at the very top of the tree
[SPEAKER_00]: and also on the ground while the red birds
are occupying the trunk of the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an example of competitive exclusion
as part of resource partitioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at specific at this resource
partitioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well this is when niches overlap,
two outcomes are possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that competitive exclusion or
really this resource partitioning that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a tree here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different bird species that will
occupy different portions of the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are going to be located at the very
top or apical meristem of the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are going to be closer to the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are going to be in the midsection
towards the ends here, the ends of the
[SPEAKER_00]: branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, these bird species are
going to be located in that center portion
[SPEAKER_00]: of the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these warbler species, they're all
warblers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all occupy the same tree,
but because of resource partitioning,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're occupying different specific
niches or different specific areas within
[SPEAKER_00]: the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here with the lights lighting up
on the different areas, these could be
[SPEAKER_00]: examples of different niches within the
tree, which is going to result of resource
[SPEAKER_00]: partitioning and allow different species
to kind of coexist without overlapping any
[SPEAKER_00]: particular physical space habitat in the
actual tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this resource partitioning,
a persistent competition is rare in
[SPEAKER_00]: natural communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either one species drives the other to
extinction or natural selection reduces
[SPEAKER_00]: the competition between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an example of this resource
partitioning is we have hawks and owls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawks and owls, they both have the same
prey.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a region of niche overlap
that's occurring between species one,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll just call them the hawks,
and species two, the owls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both overlapping and competing for the
same mice here.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, due to resource partitioning,
we have this now separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're reducing this overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did this happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're still feeding on the same
species here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawks and owls are still eating mice,
but the hawks are hunting by the day and
[SPEAKER_00]: the owls at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a way of separating out and
reducing the direct competition of both
[SPEAKER_00]: hawks and owls so they're not competing
for the same prey at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sympatric species occupy the same
geographical areas, but they avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: competition by partitioning resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have two different whale
species, and this sympatric species tend
[SPEAKER_00]: to exhibit greater differences than the
allopatric one, which we'll talk about in
[SPEAKER_00]: the next slide, species two.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is resulting in character
displacement, which facilitates habitat
[SPEAKER_00]: partitioning and thus reduces competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's an example of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I have these pictures here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have the killer whales here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which have teeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why they have teeth is they're
actively seeking in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actively seeking seals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a different whale species
that has this filtration system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both living in the same ocean,
but these are going through and straining
[SPEAKER_00]: out a small little plankton so that they
can feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a sympatic species.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're occupying the same geographical
area, but avoiding competition by feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: on different food items.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's feeding on very small almost
microorganisms here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other is feeding on large
microorganisms such as the seals.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, one has teeth and one has a
filtration system to push out and strain
[SPEAKER_00]: out those from the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of research
partitioning with sympatric species.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, we have research
partitioning with allopatric species.
[SPEAKER_00]: These do not live in the same geographic
area and thus do not compete.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have Costa Rica fishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have different fish species in the
Caribbean versus the Pacific Ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of allopatric species
because they don't live in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: geographic area and therefore do not
directly compete with one another.
This is an example of allopatric species
because they do not live in the same
geographic area and therefore do not
compete.
