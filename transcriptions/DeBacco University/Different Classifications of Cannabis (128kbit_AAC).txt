[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for tuning in to another Tobacco
University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, we'll be looking at
different classifications of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: how we kind of define some of those
classifications as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, it's all cannabis,
say, in the sense that hemp, fiber,
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana all fall under the broad
category of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the cannabis category, though,
each offer further classification and has
[SPEAKER_00]: specific definition allowing for
distinction from the different subsets
[SPEAKER_00]: within the broader term that we call
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have hemp being defined by the FDA
and Farm Bill, particularly the 2018 Farm
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill that was signed into law on December
20th, 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among other things, this new law changes
certain federal authorities relating to
[SPEAKER_00]: the production and marketing of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: They define hemp as the plant cannabis
sativa and any part of that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: including the seeds thereof, and all
derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: isomers, acids, salts, and salts of
isomers, whether growing or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a delta-9 tetracannabidiol
concentration of not more than 0.3% of a
[SPEAKER_00]: dry weight basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is THC, if you were one of the
delta-9 THC that you may be familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how they define hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp is basically not more than 0.3% dry
weight THC is how the FDA and Farm Bill of
[SPEAKER_00]: 2018 define hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have also fiber hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within hemp, there's kind of all these
different kind of subsets, but fiber hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: is a sustainable and high-yielding
industrial crop that can help meet high
[SPEAKER_00]: global demands for fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been used in this sense as the
actual kind of twine here, fiber
[SPEAKER_00]: production for clothing, for example,
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp can be grown for fiber seeds and or
for dual purpose in a wide range of
[SPEAKER_00]: geographic zones and climates,
making it favorable to grow in different
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just like it's going to be
isolated to one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is favorable over a large range of
geographic zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the products that it can produce
can also be used for a wide variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: different tasks or different kind of
textiles, foods, cosmetics, medicines,
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-microbials.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole bunch of things kind of
looking at a potential for the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then marijuana, lastly here,
how do we define marijuana then?
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be called weed, pot, dope,
or cannabis, just in the kind of quick
[SPEAKER_00]: term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is usually referring to the dried
flowers and leaves of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this contains some mind-altering
psychoactive compounds like THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is as well as other active
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also contain cannabidiol,
which is CBD, and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: non-mind-altering.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what, again, defines it as truly
marijuana goes back to the 2018 Farm Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And marijuana would be defined as simply
having greater than 0.3% THC in a dry
[SPEAKER_00]: weight basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So immediately, as soon as that plant,
as soon as that flower goes above that
[SPEAKER_00]: threshold there, it crosses the divide
between what we define here as hemp to
[SPEAKER_00]: what we kind of refer to here as
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, important to make that
distinction, and hopefully you were able
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn something within this video here.
