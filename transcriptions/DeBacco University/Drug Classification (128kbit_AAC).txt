[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video
going over drug classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at different classes
and schedules for some example drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now first off it's important to remember
that United States Code, the USC for
[SPEAKER_00]: Controlled Substances Act, provides a list
and rating scale called schedules and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll see some of those here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drug potency, potential for abuse,
likelihood for physical dependency,
[SPEAKER_00]: and medical implications are all factored
in to the scheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also this act establishes penalties for
offenses and we can kind of see the
[SPEAKER_00]: website link provided here when this video
was originally created.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Controlled Substances Act or the
schedule, so the schedule 1, 2,
[SPEAKER_00]: 3, 4, and 5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Schedule 1 is considered to be the highest
here, the highest potential for abuse,
[SPEAKER_00]: no current accepted medical use in the
United States, lack of an acceptable level
[SPEAKER_00]: of safety, and use under medical
supervision.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see some examples there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we look at the examples,
probably the one that's under most
[SPEAKER_00]: scrutiny, is marijuana as far as does it
fit all of these schedule 1
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going down we see schedule 2, a high
potential for abuse, schedule 3 is less
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for abuse than schedule 1 or 2,
and so on and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the precipitous downward scale all
the way down to schedule 5 where it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: low potential for abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also some examples provided as far
as what currently is classified in all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these different schedules.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to scheduling, we also have
general classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are some general classifications
such as depressants, hallucinogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: inhalants, we see marijuana also listed
here, narcotics, steroids, stimulants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and synthetic drugs, some of the effects
typically associated with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and at the very last column here some
examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're welcome to take a look at this,
not going to bore you and go through all
[SPEAKER_00]: this, but this just shows some
classifications of different drugs and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the effects and examples for those
drugs.
