[SPEAKER_00]: This Debaco University video is going to
highlight the terpene Linaldo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you can learn a little bit
more information about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the terpene
guide for Linaldo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, where is it located?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's scent and its basic properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a floral terpene and used in
many perfumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something you might be familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's found in a whole host of different
foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cinnamon, celery, lavender, rosewood,
sweet basil, and thyme as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Linaldo is commonly found in lavender,
and its aroma is light and floral,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's why you might be familiar with
this particular scent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does differ from other terpenes
commonly found in cannabis, and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: has an OH, or hydroxyl group, attached to
it, making it a terpene alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of might change some of the
various properties when you're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: combining it with different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the medical benefits of Linaldo is
that it has been shown to be helpful in
[SPEAKER_00]: treating mental disorders such as
depression as well as anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Linaldo may even be used as a sedative,
sleep aid, as well as an
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-conversalant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of an interesting kind of
properties here for this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some studies even have reported the
anti-inflammatory effects of this
[SPEAKER_00]: essential oil, and it is found in other
things other than just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's widely known for the ability to
reduce stress, and it's used as an
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-anxiety, anti-depressant,
and also a sedative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Linaldo is also used to relieve seizure
symptoms, provide relief from those
[SPEAKER_00]: suffering from psychosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a relaxing effect and can help you
sleep better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of great benefits with this
particular terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at potentially where to
find it, well this kind of gives you a
[SPEAKER_00]: general idea of some strains that might
have this terpene in a little bit higher
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, cannabis strains with purple
leaves and flowers tend to have higher
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations of this Linaldo.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the specific phenotype of each
plant will have different levels of this
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene that are actually present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always good to get a test done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the reason why I stress the purple
leaves, anthocyanins is another kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: plant pigment that's produced,
and we notice a lot of purple coloration
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with this particular terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is just a slight indication that
if you're seeing something that has higher
[SPEAKER_00]: anthocyanin production, a little more of
purple leaves, there's a chance or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: odds that it will also have a higher
concentration of Linaldo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best of luck if you're looking for this
particular terpene.
