[SPEAKER_01]: Here on this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over how to properly take
[SPEAKER_01]: a soil sample because it's very important
that you follow the right protocols so
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're sending a quality sample to
the lab that you'll be basing your results
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, here I'm going to go over the
steps on how to take a proper soil sample
[SPEAKER_01]: and then walking you through the process
myself as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you enjoy the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first off, why would we be taking a
soil test?
[SPEAKER_01]: And a soil test can help tell the
chemistry of the soil that cannot be seen
[SPEAKER_01]: based on only a visual inspection.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can also aid in deciding what
amendments need to be added to an area
[SPEAKER_01]: with the proper sample can end up saving
the grower a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to not just take any
random soil sample to be sure that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going about it in the proper method
because you're going to be basing
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully a lot of amendments and a lot of
end kind of processes from here based on
[SPEAKER_01]: the results of that soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take a quality sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll pay off in the end for you in your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how to ensure a good sample?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the goal is to get a field
representative sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is accomplished by collecting many
sub samples that are put together to
[SPEAKER_01]: create an average sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't just want to sample from one
area and send that off to the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get a collection of samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not sample only from that one area.
[SPEAKER_01]: As simply put, this will not produce
results representative of the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will only provide information about a
point in that whole field area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many point occurrences can occur that can
lead to non-representative results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's an example?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I only sample from this area,
what could have happened in that area?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there could have been a fertilizer
spill.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be in the vehicle parked or
tractor parked in that lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be animal droppings.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be uneven drainage in that
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: A whole potential host of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is why you don't want to take from
one area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to take from multiple reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Collect them together to get a good field
representative sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what equipment do I need?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this can vary depending on your exact
sample method.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, you need a map.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to know what area or areas
you'll be sampling and where each is
[SPEAKER_01]: located and what each is referred to as,
as far as naming and labeling your sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: A shovel, spade, or coring device.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go over some of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal is to collect a consistent soil
profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may want to avoid rusty iron tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could artificially inflate the iron
numbers, as a side note.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a bucket or some sort of holding
device.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where the soil subsamples will be
collected and then nixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: To ensure isolated samples, the bucket may
be lined with a plastic trash bag to avoid
[SPEAKER_01]: any potential contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows you to label that bag,
seal it up, and then you can move along
[SPEAKER_01]: with that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Small plastic bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is where the final representative
sample will be placed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it should be double bagged when sent
to the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And be sure you label each bag with the
name of the field representative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Field or identification name, as well as
your own name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a marker to label, label,
label to make sure you don't end up with
[SPEAKER_01]: all bags of soil in the end and not
remember where any were exactly from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now where to collect the samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this we see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we go about collecting samples?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some different methods here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first question is how large of an
area?
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, in short, it depends on where
you go about collecting samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fields that will be sampled individually,
but if areas are seen to be different,
[SPEAKER_01]: there should be separate samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And labeled separately as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be field one good, field one bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be a good and bad area of the
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: A high area and a low area.
[SPEAKER_01]: A wet area and a dry area.
[SPEAKER_01]: For large fields, it's advised to break
them into smaller subsections,
[SPEAKER_01]: such as field four upper, field four
lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Field four north, field four south.
[SPEAKER_01]: Field four east and west.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something, a way to kind of separate those
to create little smaller areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to give you an idea of what might be
going on in one part of the field compared
[SPEAKER_01]: to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now how deep do you sample?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the goal really is six to nine
inches deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is considered to be the main root
zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to go through and measure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can measure some tools of measurements
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Idea of how deep your spade is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a little marker line on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But six to nine inches deep, that's your
goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now sampling methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we're going to look at the spade
method.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see some nice pictures located
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: First part, of course, is to clear the
surface litter and plant growth from the
[SPEAKER_01]: spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to start with just a flat soil
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to dig a hole about as wide as
your spade and as deep as the layers
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then with the spade tip, place one inch
outside of the edge of the hole,
[SPEAKER_01]: cut down, remove a slice of one side of
the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we see the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut a little hole there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going right down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're cutting a one slice thickness by six
to nine inches long area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keeping that slice at the blade of the
spade, use a trowel knife or stick to cut
[SPEAKER_01]: away the sides and slice, leaving the
center section about one inch wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kind of keep that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can cut it down a little bit,
or you can just use that same whole sample
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, this one inch by one inch
vertical section of your soil is your sub
[SPEAKER_01]: sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would really cut down on the
amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of having one area be so large,
you can cut it down or you can just use
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole thing, particularly for using a
larger pail.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to place all these sub samples
into a plastic container, mix them
[SPEAKER_01]: together well, and then remove about two
cups or one pint of this mixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your composite sample to send to
the laboratory for analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an explanation here,
looking at the spade method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we also get into the PVC pipe
sampling method, where we're looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same thing can be applied to a PVC
pipe or also a coring device as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're looking at our coring device
or PVC sample, acquire a two foot length
[SPEAKER_01]: of an inch and a half PVC pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark six to nine inches on the pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pound it into the ground, at least to the
six inch mark, but try to get to the nine
[SPEAKER_01]: inch mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remove the core, dislodge it into the pail
and repeat this six to nine times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the advantage of the coring device is
it's typically stainless steel and it
[SPEAKER_01]: makes it a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't want to get one of the
kind of higher end stainless steel
[SPEAKER_01]: methods, if you've got a sledgehammer and
two foot length of inch and a half pipe,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can go through and do this same exact
method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Realize with the pipe you will be getting
more samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, that five gallon pail is
advised.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mix it all together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take your sub sample, label, label,
label, send it off to the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now preparing your soil sample for
analysis in the sense that you want to mix
[SPEAKER_01]: your sub samples together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've collected into one large sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is too much to send to the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to take only a two cup sample
from what you have collected.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an estimation, if you're in the field,
how do I estimate two cups?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's kind of think about what two
hands can hold there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the consideration of about
two cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil should be placed into a labeled bag,
double bag the sample, include your
[SPEAKER_01]: paperwork and send it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned before, do not forget
the paperwork for your own sake,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as for the sanity of the lab
workers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be sure to clearly label everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also want to double check to make
sure you've also included the necessary
[SPEAKER_01]: paperwork with your sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't fill it out and then bag everything
up and forget to send it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you have that paperwork
included with your sample in any payment
[SPEAKER_01]: as well that might be required.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with this, we want to make sure follow
this method.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like a little bit of kind of a
laborious task, but in the end,
[SPEAKER_01]: this will definitely save you a lot of
work and allow you to make informed
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions to maximize your plant yield
overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I am in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go over how to take a soil
sample with a couple of different methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the goal is going to be the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: The end result that we're going to get is
going to be the same amount of soil field
[SPEAKER_01]: representative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while I'm in a large corn field here,
I'm going to show you an area at one
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'd be replicating this soil sampling
technique throughout the entire field to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a representative sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's two main methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, there's a soil core method.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this example here, I've got an
actual soil core.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably the easiest way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to do a lot of samples,
this is by far the way I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to take your soil core.
[SPEAKER_01]: This area here is about six to nine inches
depth is what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why you want that to be that
deep is as basically the root profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that what makes the soil core so nice
is it's stainless steel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all inclusive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take a little simple inch and a
half piece of PVC pipe, put that in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground, mark it with that six to nine
inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is to get to at least six
inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that goes well, go up to nine inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to really go much more than
that because that's really your root zone
[SPEAKER_01]: profile there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would take this, you'd pound this into
the ground and you take that core and put
[SPEAKER_01]: it into your bag right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a bag over a five gallon pail to
make sure everything is consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also got the measuring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some bags to get gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can take this out when I get my soil
sample and label this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm in one field here,
we might be going through doing multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep that in mind that keeping
everything labeled is very important and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a great way to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, the bag also keeps any
contaminants that might be in the bucket
[SPEAKER_01]: separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, you could use a PVC pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the inch and a half because it
comes out relatively easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're kind of going through and able to
dislodge it much easier than if it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller diameter pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since we've got the official soil core
here, it operates in the same method.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's my sample area and here's my
corn plants, plants or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put that here on the soil and
then I'm going to push that down to about
[SPEAKER_01]: that mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give it a little rotate and when I go to
pull this out, you're going to notice I've
[SPEAKER_01]: got my nice core right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now with this core that I have,
I'm going to be taking that and adding
[SPEAKER_01]: that to the bucket right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's great about the official soil
probe is that because it's got this half
[SPEAKER_01]: cut, it makes it really easy to go through
and now replicate this.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I realized not everyone has a
soil core.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's something that you may have
around?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you may have a regular spade and you
can do the exact same method.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this area here, what we want to do
is we want to make a hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we go through, get our spade,
and we're going to remove a chunk of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we don't want to take this as our soil
sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm doing is I'm cutting a hole down
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some earthworms, always nice to
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going down that same about six to
nine inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with my spade, what makes this wise,
what I want to speed with that flat point
[SPEAKER_01]: here is I'm going to go through now and
not take this soil as my sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a profile here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take my spade, take about an inch away
from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go straight down and take that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what essentially I've got now is that
one inch profile of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you could take this entire sample,
put it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to be doing a lot of
samples that don't want to carry around
[SPEAKER_01]: that much weight of soil because the
bucket gets heavy, you can go through and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can remove a portion of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you're consistent and take only
maybe the center portion there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can take out some of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind, you want to keep that side
of that center region.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be your consistent soil
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can see a lot of enough moisture in
the soil here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that, essentially that core,
that profile, add that to our bag,
[SPEAKER_01]: go back through, refill this in so you
don't trip over it in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_01]: night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then go through and replicate that
again and again.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're done, we've got all of our
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need to send the whole full bag
of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only need approximately, if we mix
everything up from all of our cores,
[SPEAKER_01]: get a good kind of representative sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we need to send to the lab is
basically what two hands can hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all the soil sample we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to send them a five gallon
pail.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also don't want to send them a thimble
amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to hold what basically two hands
can hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the volume of soil we want to
add.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend just a regular little lunch
bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get your all the soil,
mixed up and you get it nice kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: together, you want to remove anything
large that you see in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lab will screen that out, but why send
it to them if you know they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: screen that out anyway?
[SPEAKER_01]: Visually what this generally looks like,
it's approximately this much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Label the bag, double bag it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as always, when you're sending this,
make sure you also include the appropriate
[SPEAKER_01]: paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lab will thank you and those help you
ensure that you're getting accurate
[SPEAKER_01]: results and they know exactly who that
soil belongs to and where the results need
[SPEAKER_00]: to go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so we're going to use this
field as a representative field for taking
[SPEAKER_01]: soil samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we look at the field overall,
we don't see any major like really low
[SPEAKER_01]: spots or any dips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can do some normal random sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this here is going to be my first point
to randomly sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's go through and see where else I
would sample this particular field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd also take a sample from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think another sample from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think another sample from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another one from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this looks like a good spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take another one from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another sample right from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another one from here.
And another one from here.
