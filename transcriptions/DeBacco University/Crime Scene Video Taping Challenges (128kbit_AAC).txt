[SPEAKER_00]: So often people will ask, how come crime
scenes aren't just videotaped?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we taking all these pictures?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we just take a video of
everything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a lot of the challenges
associated with videotaping a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go over some of those here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why it's not often performed
is there needs to be accurate information
[SPEAKER_00]: with a dense narration during the
videotaping process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't simply just videotape an area
and just show that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There needs to be also dense narration
during that video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while that narration is occurring,
during the length of the entire video
[SPEAKER_00]: segment, there cannot be any editing going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Video needs to be non-edited in order to
uphold in court.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no editing, there's no adding,
there's no I forgot this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you miss any part of the narration
as you're going through and describing
[SPEAKER_00]: things, that can also get it thrown out of
a courtroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably the reason why they're
not often used because there's so much
[SPEAKER_00]: that needs to be included that oftentimes
you could forget one little thing and that
[SPEAKER_00]: could negate the entire use of that video
for a particular crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, video documentation, the advantage is
that traffic violations or to kind of act
[SPEAKER_00]: as an evidence component, that is
definitely advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also using evidence of cameras,
tracking where someone may be going in a
[SPEAKER_00]: car with a timestamp, that could be
helpful in that regards.
[SPEAKER_00]: To say, okay, they went through this
intersection at this time, going this
[SPEAKER_00]: direction, or then they can go to another
camera and say, okay, they're here at this
[SPEAKER_00]: time, going at this speed and kind of give
an idea where they may have gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if we're looking here at traffic
violations where you see photo enforced,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is another area where video
documentation can have its advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage, though, can record
unwanted sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's documented errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: A recorder may not know what is necessary
to include.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time and date stamp may not be accurate
and may be a source of error.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these small details can cause an
entire video to not hold in court.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of the reasons why videos
often aren't used in courtrooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: simply because of the odds of them getting
thrown out and the intense and dense
[SPEAKER_00]: information that they need to include.
Thank you.
