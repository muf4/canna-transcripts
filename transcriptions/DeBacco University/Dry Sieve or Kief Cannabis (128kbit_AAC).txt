[SPEAKER_00]: Here in this Tabaco University video,
we're going to go over dry sieve or Keefe
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and try to describe a little bit
about what this actually is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's go into the description
here of dry sieve or Keefe cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: try to explain a little bit of the process
to create this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, to make this the method,
we need the plate materials deep frozen
[SPEAKER_00]: prior to the sifting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds are then placed in a box filled
with three sets of screens with the mesh
[SPEAKER_00]: size getting smaller with each screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bigger mesh screws at the top and
then the smaller, smaller mesh gets to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom with each screen as the product is
passing through those different screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product is then agitated mechanically
or by hand by either shaking the box or to
[SPEAKER_00]: sift or kind of carting the product
through each screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This forces resin glands to fall off the
product into the individual screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the filtered product is then
collected at the bottom of the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be very fine as we see in the
pictures here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the resulting end product?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a good image.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dry sieve extract produces a fine
powder-like substance called dry sift or
[SPEAKER_00]: Keefe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If properly refined, the resulting product
can have upwards of 70% cannabinoids as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as all of the original flavors and
terpenes from the original product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes this kind of advantageous
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So other advantages of this method are
that it has the same smell and taste as
[SPEAKER_00]: original flour used for extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not use any solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dry sift is extremely versatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be smoked, vaporized, or rolled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easiest extraction method and can be done
on a very low budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are some disadvantages in
the sense that the labor and time it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce it, and it can contain more
contaminants than solvent-based methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just looking at the image here,
looking at sadly the person's hands and
[SPEAKER_00]: the cleanliness of the hands, that would
also draw into question the potential to
[SPEAKER_00]: use that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind, and this
hopefully very simple method, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: can be something that can be easily
utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, even this has its drawbacks
compared to some of the other methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take a look at the Tobacco University
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you can find an extraction
method that's the best fit for your
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
