[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be looking at soil pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no difference between the pH of
soil versus the pH of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all following the same 0 to 14 scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're talking specifically about soil
pH, we're looking at assessing the pH of
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual media or substrate that the
plants are going to be growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it is the soil we're going to be
looking at, if you're having a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: with pH, it's a good idea to test your
irrigation water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because testing the pH of your irrigation
water is a good idea because this can
[SPEAKER_00]: impact plant growth and soil quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, for example, this is your
irrigation water, and it has a pH of 4.96.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could vastly be impacting the pH of
your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, depending on what media it
might be growing in, wondering why it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: In part, test your water to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH scale is the same 0 to 14 scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's logarithmic because, as you can see
here, it's a 10-fold increase per each pH
[SPEAKER_00]: unit that it goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you said, I'm only a couple points
off, well, that's like 10-fold increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can get exponentially off there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why we want to maintain
that pH is it affects the availability of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients for our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we test it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH meters only can test liquid,
not dry soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to go through and develop a
liquid medium or slurry from your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure the tester you're using is
calibrated and the probe doesn't dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a term called when it dries,
it dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why you'll see in labs pH probes
are kept in usually distilled water at all
[SPEAKER_00]: times, even when not in use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do you go about testing soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you want to start with a clean
probe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have any interaction or
contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to add distilled water to the
soil to create a slurry and then test the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially before, you can't just kind of
take the probe and put it in the pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in the soil and get an accurate
reading for pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to kind of create this slurry
solution here to, again, get that accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you want to use distilled
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the water you're adding isn't
influencing the total pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pH testing, best done as part of a
complete soil test that's carried out with
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent protocols in a professional
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd much rather send my soil or media out
to a lab to get professionally done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do make these kits where you kind of
add solutions and you kind of look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: color.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can give you varied results.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's best to get it done professionally in
the lab with set protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: That target pH is what you should be
shooting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually around 6.5 to 7 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.8 is usually kind of the ideal or the
sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, if you're growing hydroponically,
they could be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your target might be a little bit more
acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 5.8 to 6.8 or 6.3 being the ideal pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, acidic pH is below 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those hydroponic setups tend also to have
reduced buffering capacity if it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: pure water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could cause rapid swings in the pH
and this can result in very poor plant
[SPEAKER_00]: performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are growing hydroponically,
you want to make sure you just buffers in
[SPEAKER_00]: place to help resist change in pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do want to maintain it slightly more
acidic, but you kind of want to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: that pH from jumping around a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really going to affect and negatively
impact your plant's growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for correcting or rising the soil pH,
that's very common for New England soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is typically looking at 5.5 to 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often this needs to be raised.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can even be less than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Limestone is the most common method for
raising soil pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a general term.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different types of lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: People might say, oh, I'm liming the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can look more specifically at the
options you have within the broad category
[SPEAKER_00]: of limestone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's dolomitic lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the cheapest and easiest to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see right here, dolomitic limestone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kinds are, it's very high in
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a soil test that comes high
in magnesium, well, odds are you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at another lime alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the cheapest and typically
easiest to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's something called calcitic
lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is very effective at raising the
soil's pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mainly just calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very high in magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, for high magnesium soils,
calcitic lime might be the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kinds are typically harder to find,
and it can be more costly when you do find
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other third main category of lime is
what's called hydrated lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a quick way to change pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often though, it's not a long-term pH
change solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for conditions that require high
doses, there can be toxicity issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, it's immediately the mucous
membrane irritant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically why with this lime,
you'll see keep out of reach of children.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very usually a fine dusty product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do breathe any of that in,
you will feel kind of that burning
[SPEAKER_00]: sensation of your mucous membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also, that's a little bit lowering
soil pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a condition where your pH would be
seven or even a little bit above that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common Rocky Mountains and West,
where the pH is a little higher than the
[SPEAKER_00]: desired amount for plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically you're looking at adding sulfur,
iron sulfate, or aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all ways to kind of help lower
the pH of your soil to help get it again
[SPEAKER_00]: to that sweet spot, that target range of
being slightly acidic for maximum nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: availability and for the best plant
growth.
