[SPEAKER_00]: Okay here we're going to look at insect
management for squash because if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing squash you're likely to see one if
not all four of these insects on your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one is cucumber beetles I'm going to
start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are small yellow beetles with either
black spots or black stripes and they can
[SPEAKER_00]: start very early in the season as early as
first week of May.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insect netting is a good thing to cover
your young seedlings with to act as a
[SPEAKER_00]: physical barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organically they can be controlled with
pyganic or surround or chemically while
[SPEAKER_00]: they are small there's rarely just one and
they will devastate leaves and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: very voracious eaters so important to keep
monitoring your plants especially when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Squash bugs is another one to look out for
they're large brown beetles and have
[SPEAKER_00]: almost an armor plating to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're crushed they smell like a
sour apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really small reddish tannish eggs and
often laid in clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent these the same thing insect
netting is the only real option.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very difficult to control
organically pyganic may have some
[SPEAKER_00]: effectiveness chemically seven but it does
not really work that well on adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to spray them at the end in stage
because they're much easier to control at
[SPEAKER_00]: this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The products work a little bit better that
armor plating kind of shields them from
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the chemicals insecticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you a size comparison this is a
spotted cucumber beetle so you can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: relative size comparison of these squash
bugs adult and thence to a spotted
[SPEAKER_00]: cucumber beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's squash vine borers they're
large black moss that are mostly active
[SPEAKER_00]: around the mid part of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent them would be a physical
barrier like insect netting or you could
[SPEAKER_00]: plant butternut squash because they have
solid vines and they're immune to squash
[SPEAKER_00]: vine borers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the moss don't really do the damage
they lay single eggs throughout the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: typically on the lower leaf stocks or the
vine itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens from the egg is a small
grubble hatch and burrow into the vine and
[SPEAKER_00]: eat it from the inside out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to lay these eggs at the base of
the plant and they're extremely hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: spot and typically see this orange kind of
frass and that can be an indication that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a grub inside especially if the
plant starts to wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids another concern what they lack in
size make up for in numbers very small
[SPEAKER_00]: black or tan or white or clear specks is
what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of shows a very small how they
can look here on the underside of a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find bumblebees in an area that's
devoid of flowers look closer oftentimes
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a high site of aphid feeding
because they're releasing plant sugars
[SPEAKER_00]: that the bumblebees are feeding on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use reflective plastic weed block
to help repel aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be very difficult to control
spraying garlic based sprays can help
[SPEAKER_00]: repel them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also biological control such as
green lace weeks which can help actively
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of insect insect biocontrol them but
they are very small and they do have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of numbers and they can do severe damage
to your crops.
