[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to investigate the
domain Eukarya, provide some examples to
[SPEAKER_00]: show you how diverse this particular
domain is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the basics, it appeared
about 1.5 billion years ago, contains
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms most people are familiar with,
and they consist of four kingdoms below
[SPEAKER_00]: the domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first one is animals, plants,
and fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, protists.
[SPEAKER_00]: The animals, plants, and fungi are
well-defined evolutionary groups in a
[SPEAKER_00]: largely multicellular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protists are kind of their own unique,
unicellular, and very diverse group here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all four of these, though, are still
under the domain Eukarya, but our four
[SPEAKER_00]: kingdoms within that can be slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Eukarya.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hallmark of Eukaryotes is complex
cellular organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's highlighted by the presence of
organelles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitochondria and chloroplasts are the most
likely entered in early Eukaryotic cells
[SPEAKER_00]: through process of endosymbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, mitochondria descends of purple
bacteria and chloroplasts from
[SPEAKER_00]: cyanobacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at this kingdom of protists,
these organisms are placed here more
[SPEAKER_00]: because of what they are not than what
they are So this is kind of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse kingdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains all Eukaryotes that are not
plants, animals, or fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more than 50,000 species in all.
[SPEAKER_00]: This includes unicellularin, as well as a
few simple multicellular Eukaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This mode of nutrition is how some of
these protists are classified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some move around in search of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are heterotrophic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some make their own food.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are called autotrophs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some absorb their own food,
which are not heterotrophic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are decomposers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these terms shouldn't be that strange
or foreign to you, but this just shows you
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the diversity that does exist
within the kingdom of protists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diatoms is a group of algae, commonly
phytoplankton.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at some of these, they have
very unique shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're used in art a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very symmetrical in some
instances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each are very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this visual interest causes them to be
used in a lot of posters or in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: other mediums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are diatoms, which are under the
kingdom of protists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other types of photosynthetic protists are
endosymmatic of some Eukaryotic organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here, this prime example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our coral, which is an animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look inside this animal,
you see there's an algae living inside it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another example of this
endosymbiosis and how these two different
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms are coming together for a common
purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Algae is able to capture sunlight and
produce sugar from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the animal's able to provide
protection of this algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chloroplasts and endosymbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, chloroplasts are thought to be
once free living, similar bacteria that
[SPEAKER_00]: were engulfed by a Eukaryotic cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The presence of a double membrane DNA both
support this idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some other features, but these are
the main two.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sense that it was once free living and
now incorporated into the Eukaryotic cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kingdom fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungi are Eukaryotes, and most are
multicellular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cells of fungi have cell walls that
contain the material called chitin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This includes molds, mildews, mushrooms,
and yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chitin is also that hard outer shell to
insects or crabs or lobsters or shrimp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same basic material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also produce some mildews.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can be negative impacts here on
these grapes and yeast to cause bread to
[SPEAKER_00]: rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a lab on yeast that was an example
of an organism that would be classified in
[SPEAKER_00]: the kingdom of fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within this kingdom of fungi, what's
interesting is our heterotrophs and obtain
[SPEAKER_00]: their nutrients by releasing digestive
enzymes into a food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: They absorb their food after it's been
digested by these enzymes and broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungi act either as decomposers or as
parasites in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of how they can look here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have seen them on bread,
kind of breaking that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these structures are very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungi have things called hyphae and
mycelium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycelium are these large structures here,
vegetative part of the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're composed of hyphae and is a
collection of hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another way to think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like a patch of threads or strands
and function at the macro level.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be an example of mycelium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically here, this small region here
would be an example of hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fine branching filaments and they
make up mycelium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the building blocks of fungi and
they look like threads or strands and they
[SPEAKER_00]: function at the micro level.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times this would be the exact
site of nutrient absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mycelium would be the larger
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our hyphae would be these very thin,
straight regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go back to the other slide for a
moment, this would be an example here of
[SPEAKER_00]: the mycelium, would be the proper term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here would be a hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: This specific region right here would be
hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole thing would be mycelium.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a good comparison between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kingdom of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are eukaryotic multicellular and
are autotrophs because they carry out the
[SPEAKER_00]: process of photosynthesis, conversion of
light energy to sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to spend an entire lecture
series on this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very complex, but plants are able to
perform this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a very diverse kingdom here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants have cell walls that contain
polysaccharide cellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polysaccharide meaning many sugars we see
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant cells are specialized for different
functions such as photosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_00]: transport of and support materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Xylem and phloem, moving of water and
sugars within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our cellulose, a very complex
polysaccharide composed of a long chain
[SPEAKER_00]: and branch chain, connected chain of
glucose monomers or monosaccharides.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows an example of how the kingdom
is organized and how flowering plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: considered more advanced than say your
mosses or liverworts are considered very
[SPEAKER_00]: simple in their structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vascular tissues start at club mosses and
progress to ferns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we see seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to spend a lot of time on
classification of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you a basic introduction of
gymnosperms versus angiosperms being more
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, here's our common green algal
ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these plants are thought of to have
derived from that common ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kingdom of animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic,
and autotrophic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animal cells have no cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a major point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to put it in bold here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lack a cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a presence of a cell wall,
you can initially eliminate the
[SPEAKER_00]: classification or kingdom of animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are permanently attached to surfaces
such as sponges and barnacles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This includes fish, birds, reptiles,
amphibians, mammals, and also us humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kingdom also includes sponges,
jellyfish, worms, sea stars, and insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the jellyfish or especially our
coral and sponges here are often thought
[SPEAKER_00]: of as being something else other than
animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just beyond the kind of obvious
animals, all of these are animals too.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
