[SPEAKER_00]: This is an important aspect for all indoor
cannabis growers and that is looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the proper placement of sensors in the
cannabis grow area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So follow along in this video and we'll go
over to make sure you're properly placing
[SPEAKER_00]: your sensors for accurate readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's make sure you're properly
placing your sensors in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, it's important to realize
that a sensor is only as good as its
[SPEAKER_00]: placement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind what conditions you're
monitoring and how the placement of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor will impact those readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there are many conditions that
should be monitored, temperature will be
[SPEAKER_00]: used as the example provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure we're right on point
because we're off by a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That placement's off a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really going to throw things off in
the facility in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do you place your temperature
sensor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where would be the kind of the area that
you'd place it in your grow facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, take a grow room or grow tent as an
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Near the top is often going to be higher
than average temperature, will be given
[SPEAKER_00]: since heat is going to naturally want to
rise through your grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the middle or at plant height gives a
general estimate of the area's
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put it near the floor, it'll be a
lower than average temperature given that
[SPEAKER_00]: colder air tends to sink as well as CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that mindful of that area where
you're placing that sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the obvious choice as a grower would
say would be I want to have my sensor at,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, plant height.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this is where most growers put the
monitor system, this may not be the best
[SPEAKER_00]: location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reason being you want to make sure you're
taking other factors into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the light placement?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's the air circulation patterns in your
grow tent or grow room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there doorway locations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that impacting things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there viewing areas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there vents?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that going to impact different
factors when you're looking specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: here at temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned that light placement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to ensure that there's not a
light directly on the temperature sensor
[SPEAKER_00]: as the can cause an inaccurate reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have some idea of where the
plant is but want to be mindful of where
[SPEAKER_00]: the intensity of the light is,
where that heat source from that light's
[SPEAKER_00]: going and being projected.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to put that temperature
sensor near that because we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a false reading or a not accurate
reading for the grow area that the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is being exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those air circulation patterns that I
mentioned, is the plant height getting
[SPEAKER_00]: more or is plant height getting less air
circulation from a fan?
[SPEAKER_00]: This will also impact the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to have an idea of what is the
general airflow pattern in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that plant height really the best
height there for temperature readings in
[SPEAKER_00]: that grow facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doorway locations and doorway locations
could be physical doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could also be, as we see here,
they could also be doorways as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: plant access points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So putting the sensor near the entranceway
is common practice to make reading easier
[SPEAKER_00]: but you may want to consider if this is
actually representative of the field
[SPEAKER_00]: location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in their growing location, we want to
put near the door so we can just peek in
[SPEAKER_00]: and see what the temperature is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, is that the best location?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the best location then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the best location really comes down
to is an area that's representative of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically, yes, that's around plant
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be the general kind of
consensus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the general conditions are
located.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look very hard at your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look very hard at your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that really representative of what's
going on overall?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure we're away from any
fans and not too close to lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going to place that exactly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because where you place that sensor,
that's what your readings are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: based off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you place the center in a poor
location, if that's not in the right or
[SPEAKER_00]: proper representative location in your
grow space, all the numbers you read are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be skewed in one direction or
another causing you potentially to make
[SPEAKER_00]: false data collection and potentially not
maximize the growing facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing environment and adjustments
for your plants.
