[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a quick overview of
the spinal cord basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, we can't forget about how we
label our vertebrae, such as cervical
[SPEAKER_00]: regions, our thoracic region, our lumbar
and our pelvic, because those same terms
[SPEAKER_00]: apply to different regions of the spinal
cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, we have sensory or ascending
efferent pathways in blue here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and those are areas of the spinal cord
that will send a signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we touch a hot beaker, that sense of
heat and burning is going to go through
[SPEAKER_00]: the sensory pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then our brain will process that
information and say we need to remove our
[SPEAKER_00]: hand from the very hot beaker,
and our motor or descending efferent
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways indicated in red here shows where
those signals from the brain will pass
[SPEAKER_00]: through the spinal cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on with our central nervous
system, looking specifically again at the
[SPEAKER_00]: spinal cord region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the spinal cord, simply put,
is a column of nerves from the brain to
[SPEAKER_00]: the tailbone, protected by the vertebrae
of the spine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's responsible for conducting the
impulses between the brain and the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those impulses can come from a variety of
senses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can come from our skin, it can come
from a variety of our organs, our glands,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these kind of feed into helping the
body maintain homeostasis, and also having
[SPEAKER_00]: the body being able to sense it's both
external as well as its internal
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we see the terms like T1,
T2, that's referring to thoracic 1,
[SPEAKER_00]: thoracic 2, L1 would refer to lumbar
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: An interesting fact about the nervous
system in the spinal cord that we talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about all these nerve impulses moving,
they move very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually travel at about 268 miles
per hour is how quick these impulses are
[SPEAKER_00]: being transferred, so it's very quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the spinal cord, there's two
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's gray matter, and there's white
matter, and the gray matter, indicated
[SPEAKER_00]: here by the yellowish region, is the
neuron cell bodies located in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white matter, indicated by this kind
of tinnitus region here, are axons and
[SPEAKER_00]: dendrites on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here this sectional organization
of the spinal cord, and also what a cross
[SPEAKER_00]: section stain would look like,
and we still see those distinctive regions
[SPEAKER_00]: in all three of these images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much clearer in here, but even in a cross
section that's been stained, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly tell the difference between gray
and red.
[SPEAKER_00]: White matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
