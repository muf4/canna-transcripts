[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to look at the
organization of vascular plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three images here all show vascular
plants, even though they fall into
[SPEAKER_00]: different categories or subsets.
[SPEAKER_00]: These should be seedless vascular plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These should be what we call herbaceous
vascular plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These should be woody vascular plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking in general, plants contain
growth zones of unspecialized cells called
[SPEAKER_00]: meristems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Primary growth is initiated at the tips of
roots and shoots by the apical meristems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growth of these meristems results
primarily in the extension of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at where we're growing
taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondary growth involves the activity of
lateral meristems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is continued divisions of their cells
results in primary thick ening of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a thickening.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the image here, primary growth would
occur here, here, here, here, and we also
[SPEAKER_00]: can't forget about the root tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where all the primary growth would
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondary growth is looking at the lateral
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The example would be the tree trunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trunk would be thickening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where our primary growth would be those
actively growing and dividing tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these apical meristems tissue in most
plants contain creating undifferentiated
[SPEAKER_00]: cells found in areas of growth,
such as the growing tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, many people think and associate with
the shoot tips as an apical meristem,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is true, but we also can't forget
about the root tips that occur below
[SPEAKER_00]: ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember in the lab that we did,
we looked at cells going through high
[SPEAKER_00]: rates of mitosis, and these were root tip
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing is happening here at the shoot
tip, and both of these are considered
[SPEAKER_00]: apical meristems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we flip back for a second, remember
this is all involved in primary growth
[SPEAKER_00]: phase, growing with the height of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continue with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This primary growth makes plants longer or
taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's that vertical growth,
but also please don't forget about the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth that's also occurring below the
soil line there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our primary growth that's
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to transition and relate to
secondary growth here in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, we're just focusing on that
primary growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting to secondary growth, later
vascular plants developed a new pattern of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, which a ring of cells could divide
around the periphery of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the end region of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondary growth allows for plant stem to
increase in diameter, the thickening of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product of secondary growth is wood,
as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These would be examples of what we call
woody plants versus herbaceous plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: just grow like a tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these lateral meristems, there's two
types here.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one being vascular cambium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives rise to thick accumulations of
secondary xylem and phloem located right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our vascular cambium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our cork cambium forms the outer layer of
bark on both roots and shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's layers located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the vascular came in distinct
separation between these two regions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our cork came in a little bit harder to
see, but you can see there is definitely a
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct line here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going into a little bit more detail on the
vascular cambium.
[SPEAKER_00]: In stems, secondary growth is initiated by
the differentiation of the vascular
[SPEAKER_00]: cambium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thin layer of actively dividing cells
is located between the bark and the main
[SPEAKER_00]: stem and woody plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is running between the xylem and the
phloem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our xylem and here's our phloem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this thin layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our vascular cambium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cells that divide from the vascular
cambium outwardly and sit towards the bark
[SPEAKER_00]: become secondary phloem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be in this region here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cells that divide from the vascular
cambium inwardly towards the center of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tree would become secondary xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important to remember that our
xylem here, remember I showed you in some
[SPEAKER_00]: other videos what it looks like,
tends to be this larger, more open region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those cells are dead at maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phloem is a lot more sugar transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's located in woody plants closer to the
bark region.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're much smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vascular cambium is what's kind of
separating the two here and depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: what side you're on, depends what you're
ultimately going to become.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this side, we're developing a secondary
phloem and towards the inward part,
[SPEAKER_00]: our secondary xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cork cambium, as we see pictured here
and zoomed in right here, while the
[SPEAKER_00]: vascular cambium is being established,
a second kind of lateral cambium develops
[SPEAKER_00]: in the stem's outer layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the cork cambium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This consists of plates of dividing cells
that move deeper and deeper into the stem
[SPEAKER_00]: as they divide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outwardly, this cambium divides to form
densely packed cork cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inwardly, this cambium divides to produce
a layer of prank cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we see here in this image,
to try to make it as simple as possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a piece of wood we cut in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cork and cork cambium are located very
close to the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: They together make the perioderm and along
with the secondary phloem makes the bark
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be from what I was seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vascular cambium is located a little
bit more inwardly and that secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: xylem, you're definitely getting closer to
that center portion of the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: That perioderm, the cork of the cork
cambium and the prank cells collectively
[SPEAKER_00]: make up what's called the perioderm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The perioderm is the plant's outside
protective covering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The term bark refers to all the tissues in
a mature stem or root outside the vascular
[SPEAKER_00]: cambium as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this would be considered the
bark, not just a very thin layer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wood has accumulated secondary xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the true part of wood would be the
interior portion here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technically, the bark, as we may associate
it with wood, is separate and distinctive
[SPEAKER_00]: from the wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't make a two by four that
contains bark.
[SPEAKER_00]: That portion gets shaved off and the
secondary xylem, which is the wood,
[SPEAKER_00]: is what's used for structural support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rings of a tree, because of the way this
is accumulated, wood often displays rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vascular cambium divides more actively
in the springs and in the summer than in
[SPEAKER_00]: the fall and winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growth rate differences are reflected
in alternating rings of growth of
[SPEAKER_00]: different thicknesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that evident here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot can be told from a tree here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in this early part of its
life, it grew very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the large space between the
rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, at this point in its life,
you see the rings are a lot closer
[SPEAKER_00]: together, indicating growth from year to
year was much slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to cut down the tree to get
an assessment of the tree rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inside cambium becomes the xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outside cambium, the outer cells,
becomes the phloem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take a core of a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you see here, we take these cores and
we just simply pull out a core.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tropical plants, though, may not have
distinctive rings, as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, rings may vary in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are good questions to be thinking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that we said that in the
northeast, our trees tend to grow slower
[SPEAKER_00]: in the fall and winter and faster in the
spring and summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tropical plants are going to grow more
consistently, indicating they may not have
[SPEAKER_00]: these divisions or rings that develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rings may vary in size because of
environmental factors and what that tree
[SPEAKER_00]: might be experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we know that each ring develops after
a year, we know the year the tree was cut
[SPEAKER_00]: down, in this case 2017, we can trace back
and determine how old that tree is and
[SPEAKER_00]: when it may have been first planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we just have some important
historical points of interest throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the different years that this particular
tree was growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you see the different tags that could
mark different rings on the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pose the question, history of a tree
stump.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was going on with this tree?
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see there's a lot more growth
towards this upper region than it was down
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be shade on this portion of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be more competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could have been more sunlight on
this side, easier to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you could get the differences
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to look at a tree stump.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can tell you a little bit of the
history of what that tree experienced as
[SPEAKER_00]: it was growing throughout its life cycle.
