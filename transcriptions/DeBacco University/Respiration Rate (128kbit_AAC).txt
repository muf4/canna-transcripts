[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, we're going to look at some
ways respiration rates are affected,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking mainly at plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want you to remember that this also
occurs in animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our respiration rate, we may think of
our breast per minute as a way to measure
[SPEAKER_00]: respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here by the age of an
individual, and this is looking at humans,
[SPEAKER_00]: the breast per minute does change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Newborns of six weeks have the highest
breast per minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone from 30 to 60 is considered normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we age, our breast per minute
decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: With adults being somewhere in the range
of 12 to 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see our dogs here, one sitting
nice in the sun, probably has a lower
[SPEAKER_00]: respiration rate than this dog running
here in the track.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, respiration rate relate to
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at three environmental factors
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one being temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: When air temperature goes from 68 to 86
degrees Fahrenheit, the respiration rate
[SPEAKER_00]: can double.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a biological system.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, temperatures above 104 degrees
Fahrenheit can inactivate most enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, there are specific proteins that
depend on a very specific shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Above 104 degrees Fahrenheit, those
proteins can denature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Refrigeration temperatures slow the
respiration process, reducing sugar and
[SPEAKER_00]: water loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unwanted microorganism growth can also be
reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And overall survival time can be
increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we store food in the
refrigerator to help increase its shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: life by reducing the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is another way it can impact
respiration rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And living cells are about 90% water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, those seeds are also living.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only contain about 10% water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still respiring, but at a very low
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to think about the rate of
respiration can affect where a plant may
[SPEAKER_00]: be in its stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And seeds are respiring, even though it's
a very slow or low rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flooding roots, though, as these trees
have experienced, can stunt or even kill
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, really reducing respiration rate,
essentially choking out the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots need to breathe, need to exchange
oxygen with carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: When these tree roots became flooded,
that was no longer possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these plants or these trees actually
suffocated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxygen is our last factor we're going to
look at when we talk about respiration
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reducing the overall oxygen content to
about 1% to 3% can increase storage time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a sealed environment, particularly for
apples, oxygen gas can be replaced with
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen gas as a way to reduce the
respiration rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And increase the shelf life of apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apples, it's possible to actually keep
them about a full calendar year under
[SPEAKER_00]: these conditions that will reduce the
respiration rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why they tend not to do that is
the fresh apples are usually coming out,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the stored ones don't taste quite as
good as the freshly picked ones.
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
