[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to see how the
hypothalamus and the pituitary gland are
[SPEAKER_00]: linked together and how the nervous system
and endocrine system can work together to
[SPEAKER_00]: help the body maintain homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at how they're linked,
well the hypothalamus is the master nerve
[SPEAKER_00]: control center.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's related to the nervous system and it
receives information from nerves around
[SPEAKER_00]: the body about internal conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can release some hormones and regulates
the release of hormones from the pituitary
[SPEAKER_00]: gland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it can release some hormones,
it can also help regulate what the
[SPEAKER_00]: pituitary gland is releasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pituitary gland is considered the
master gland and it's part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocrine system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It secretes a broad range of hormones that
regulate other glands within the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see exactly where they're located
in the brain here, and here's our
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothalamus and here's our pituitary
gland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, looking a little bit more
specifically, we see the hypothalamus can
[SPEAKER_00]: release some hormones, but it's directly
kind of connected here to the pituitary
[SPEAKER_00]: gland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pituitary gland is located in the
bony recess in the brain below the
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothalamus, again in this region right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually two glands, a posterior lobe
and an anterior lobe, and it produces nine
[SPEAKER_00]: major hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hypothalamus located up here secretes
hormones into capillaries that cause the
[SPEAKER_00]: pituitary to release or inhibit the
release of hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this hypothalamus is helping regulate
the pituitary gland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the portal system that carries the
hormones from the hypothalamus to the
[SPEAKER_00]: pituitary gland, we see here, this kind of
connection between these two portions
[SPEAKER_00]: located right there, portion in the center
of the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at the role of the
hypothalamus now, the hypothalamus
[SPEAKER_00]: receives sensory information and relays
some to the hypothalamus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got our hypothalamus and our
hypothalamus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the hypothalamus, and again,
there's that very important pituitary
[SPEAKER_00]: gland.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hypothalamus is responsible for
monitoring the body temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: pH, and various other conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will then signal the pituitary gland if
conditions need to be corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if temperature got too
warm or too cold, or if pH got too high or
[SPEAKER_00]: too low, the hypothalamus would be
receiving that and then telling the
[SPEAKER_00]: pituitary gland to kind of help correct
the situation as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the role of the pituitary gland itself,
it's the master gland that signals other
[SPEAKER_00]: glands to produce the hormones that they
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a couple examples right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The anterior lobe of the pituitary,
on the side, receives signals from the
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothalamus and responds by sending out
appropriate hormones to other endocrine
[SPEAKER_00]: glands.
[SPEAKER_00]: The posterior portion of the pituitary
receives oxytocin, or antidiuretic
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone, ADH, from the hypothalamus,
and it relays them to the body as
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see in green, the green arrows
here, these are anterior pituitary
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then posterior hormones are the two in
purple here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both important for the body to help
maintain homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the control of the hypothalamus and
pituitary is actually called a negative
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback inhibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's regulated by hormones whose
secretions they stimulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have cold exposure with the
hypothalamus releasing hormones to the
[SPEAKER_00]: anterior pituitary, releasing a hormone
that then itself, once released and found
[SPEAKER_00]: in higher concentrations, can itself
impact or reduce or stop the anterior
[SPEAKER_00]: pituitary gland from producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this negative feedback loop,
I have another lecture on feedback loops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a brief overview of the negative
feedback loop where this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone can negatively impact or reduce,
in this case, more hormone being produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole reason is, once this is produced
in high amounts and completes the job that
[SPEAKER_00]: it needs to, it wants to stop the body
from producing it, wasting energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to prevent the body from having to
re-regulate those conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, this negative feedback is an
efficient way for the body to,
[SPEAKER_00]: once it reaches appropriate levels,
to maintain homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
