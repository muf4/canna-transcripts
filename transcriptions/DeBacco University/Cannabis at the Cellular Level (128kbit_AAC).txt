[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at cannabis at
the cellular level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants are composed of systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant, the organism, have a collection of
systems that work together to produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: functional plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two main systems include the shoot system,
which is what we see here, and below
[SPEAKER_00]: ground we have the supporting root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the plant organs work in unison to
perform a unique function for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shoot system that we typically see
above ground are the leaves, the stems,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves capture the sun's energy,
the stems support the plant structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the flower is the site of
reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Below ground here, the root system,
we have the primary, which are the main
[SPEAKER_00]: thick roots, the lateral roots,
which are initially branched from the
[SPEAKER_00]: primary root, and then what we really
can't see are really fine structures we
[SPEAKER_00]: call root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are at the end of the lateral roots
in their main state of nutrient and water
[SPEAKER_00]: absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these very thin small regions have a
very high surface area, allowing for
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient absorption of nutrients and
water in the soil or substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the organs contain specialized tissues
that allow for proper function.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here the leaves, which contain
chloroplasts, which is the main site for
[SPEAKER_00]: the photosynthetic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stems contain xylem and phloem,
which help move water and nutrients to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowers contain either male or female
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant's too young to tell whether
it's a male or female, so in here is a
[SPEAKER_00]: female structure here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots have an epidermis, which is the
outer cover, which is similar function to
[SPEAKER_00]: yours, it offers protection, and they
contain the ground and vascular tissues,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, main site of nutrient and water
absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those plant tissues, there's organized
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have guard cells, which regulate water
and carbon dioxide exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guard cells are on the underside of
leaves, and they are pores, and plants
[SPEAKER_00]: need to breathe, so this is kind of what
helps allow them to breathe and expel
[SPEAKER_00]: water, and then when it's a time of water
stress, they will close what we call the
[SPEAKER_00]: stomata, which are pores mainly on the
underside of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Xylem cells transport mainly water and
minerals in one direction from the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: to the shoots, from the bottom of the
plant to the top of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and pollen is the male sex cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see kind of here caught in a little bit
of the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these work in unison, all aspects of
the plant, including photosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, development, are all controlled by
the genetic material or the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that double helix structure here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's located mainly in the nucleus of the
cell, and it's organized into structures
[SPEAKER_00]: called chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are some unique DNA found
in both the mitochondria and the
[SPEAKER_00]: chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant regulations, well, living systems
need to be able to maintain a relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: stable internal conditions despite ever
fluctuating external conditions in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to stay alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This process of maintaining this balance
here is called homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is balancing internal
conditions, so it's not like maintaining
[SPEAKER_00]: homeostasis with time and money.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is internal conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This process is often regulated by
hormones, which are produced in the cells
[SPEAKER_00]: to allow the plant, or in this case,
any organism, to counteract changes in
[SPEAKER_00]: their external conditions to maintain that
stable internal environment we call
[SPEAKER_00]: homeostasis.
Thank you.
