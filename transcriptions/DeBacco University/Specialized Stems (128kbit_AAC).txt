[SPEAKER_00]: While you think there may only be one or a
few general types of stems, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple specialized structures that relate
to stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to run through five different
specialized stem structures and give you
[SPEAKER_00]: some indication on how they're different
and where you may have seen them before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with the first one are
specialized stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something called rhizomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are horizontal stems that grow below
the surface of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing that roots are coming off
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This structure right here is called a
rhizome.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are horizontal stems and they're
growing below the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might see one area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hops is a plant that does this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then all of a sudden we see another plant
that pops up over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, those two might be connected by a
rhizome when this contributes to how
[SPEAKER_00]: certain plants can spread very quickly
through an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another form of specialized stems,
runners and stolons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're similar to rhizomes, but they grow
above ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever been strawberry picking and
you look at one plant very closely,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't get distracted by all the
wonderful strawberries that may be in the
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice they're actually,
it looks like they're connected almost
[SPEAKER_00]: with a wire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these are similar to rhizomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These stolons are above ground stems that
link these plants together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They help allow strawberry plants to
spread and grow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time you're strawberry picking,
if you look at the strawberry,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, that's great, but you can also look
and find the runners or the stolons and
[SPEAKER_00]: point them out and show the connections
between certain plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another type of specialized stem is
tubers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They swell in size from the accumulation
of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the most notable example here
would be potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what potato plants look like above
ground if you've never seen them before or
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're referring to the tubers which are
these swollen areas that accumulate food
[SPEAKER_00]: located below ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this shows the potato plant
above ground and these are the tubers
[SPEAKER_00]: below ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all your french fries and potato chips
come from these specialized stems which is
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant accumulating food below the soil
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here they're hilled up and then in
this hill is where all the potatoes
[SPEAKER_00]: ideally will be developing and
accumulating the sugars from the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: through the photosynthetic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another type of specialized stem is bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're small stem located at the base
surrounded by fleshy leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ever had to plant bulbs,
you might have to plant them at various
[SPEAKER_00]: depths based on what plant it is and
you'll notice here our daffodils are very
[SPEAKER_00]: commonly seen in the springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with our crocuses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these are very early plants and
they grow in the early spring when there's
[SPEAKER_00]: not a lot of energy or competition and
because they have this kind of stored
[SPEAKER_00]: area, this kind of energy stored in the
bulb region, this specialized stem,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're able to grow early and take
advantage of some of the sun before some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the larger trees may shade out in the
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crocuses might be some of the first things
you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times they may germinate even
before a recent snowstorm getting closer
[SPEAKER_00]: to springtime and daffodils are these
large yellow flowers typically in a clump
[SPEAKER_00]: here which you may see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last type is called a corum and on a quick
look they look very similar to bulbs but
[SPEAKER_00]: they contain almost all stem tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again to go back for a second just for
that source of comparison, these are small
[SPEAKER_00]: stems located at the base surrounded by
fleshy leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of all these leaves located here
if we take the cross section of the bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through that same cross section with a
corum we notice in this instance there's
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the bulbs on the exterior look but
they contain almost all stem tissue and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've ever eaten garlic or are familiar
with garlic, garlic is a prime example of
[SPEAKER_00]: a corum and again if we take the cross
section it's all just about all stem
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue here which they look like on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this is helpful in going over
some of the specialized stems that do
[SPEAKER_00]: exist.
Thank you.
