[SPEAKER_00]: This video is on the alternation of
generations and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commonly this topic can trip students up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again I remind you that this link below
in the description is for the slides and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're welcome to pause this video and
watch it multiple times until you fully
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opening image here is a very
simplified version and I have several
[SPEAKER_00]: others throughout the presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part we want to look at the
gametophyte phase and the sporophyte
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sporophyte and gametophyte,
remember gametophyte means producing
[SPEAKER_00]: gametes and the sporophyte is producing
spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help you just with the initial
potential for confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the basics of this process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the situation is quite different from
that in animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where in animals the fundamental process
is that a diploid, remember 2N,
[SPEAKER_00]: the individual directly produces haploid
or N gametes by meiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that pictured here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a multicellular organism 2N
directly producing unicellular gametes at
[SPEAKER_00]: one end and those fuse together to form
again the multicellular 2N organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: However now in plants this alternation of
generations in the life cycle this is thus
[SPEAKER_00]: between a diploid, again 2N generation of
sporophytes, and a haploid N generation of
[SPEAKER_00]: gametophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does this differ?
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have our multicellular sporophyte
here but we have a multicellular
[SPEAKER_00]: gametophyte here unlike the unicellular in
animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well there's a 2N spore and then there are
1N gametes that are forming this cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this alternation of generations we see
is a couple more steps involved in plants
[SPEAKER_00]: versus animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to keep track of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go through some examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this shows you what we're more familiar
with in humans here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sperm and egg coming together through
fertilization to form the embryo that's
[SPEAKER_00]: producing the individual, that's then
producing the adult, and the process is
repeated.
[SPEAKER_00]: However here meiosis is producing male and
female spores but there's a male
[SPEAKER_00]: gametophyte and there's a female
gametophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can be multicellular haploid cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then through the process of fertilization
they're producing the embryo that's
[SPEAKER_00]: producing the young individual that
produces the adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that extra little step involved
compared to that of animals or in this
[SPEAKER_00]: example humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's that same image from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: In early plants meiosis was delayed in the
cells of the zygote divided to produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: multicellular diploid structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This resulted in an alternation of
generations in which a diploid generation
[SPEAKER_00]: alternates with a haploid one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a diploid generation is called the
sporophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be producing the spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the haploid generation is called the
gametophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be producing the gametes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that pictured here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our gametophytes producing our
spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our gametes which are fusing
together to form our zygote which is going
[SPEAKER_00]: through the process of mitosis to form the
sporophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sporophyte goes through meiosis to produce
its spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spores then can become a multicellular
gametophyte that then produce gametes and
[SPEAKER_00]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This upper region here is all haploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This lower region all diploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's put this into a little bit of a
picture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the diploid generation is called the
sporophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the 2N.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's located up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haploid generation is the gametophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the gametophyte being haploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be an example down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sporophyte here would be the
diploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these can look very different ferns.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very stark example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alternation of generations and ferns each
can look very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sporophyte is what we might be
familiar with with the fronds and leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the gametophyte actually looks like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's the result of the union
of spores fusing together to form mitosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gametophyte is going to produce
the male and female gametes that will
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilize to provide the developing
sporophyte, which will grow into what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're familiar with as our ferns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unique to ferns, those form the
yellowish-brownish mass at the edge or
[SPEAKER_00]: underside of the frond.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever seen the fern, you may have
noticed these structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shape and arrangement and location of
these, what's called sori, are often
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable cues in identifying a fern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're very unique to different fern
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sori are that spore-producing
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever seen a fern that's got all
these little dots under it, those are the
[SPEAKER_00]: sori.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is a great image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to repeat and go through some of
the steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, diploid zygote, two single-cell
haploid gametes, each containing an
[SPEAKER_00]: unpaired chromosomal chromosome fused to
form a single-celled diploid zygote.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the process of fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: This zygote now contains n pairs of
chromosomes, which is 2n chromosomes in
[SPEAKER_00]: total.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice the line here says everything
that's going to be in the 2n.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our first phase of five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving along here, getting to our
sporophyte, the single-cell diploid zygote
[SPEAKER_00]: germinates, dividing by the normal process
of mitosis, which maintains the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes at 2n.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the 2n here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This results in a multicellular diploid
organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called the sporophyte,
because that maturity produces spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to work our way clockwise around
here, getting to the sporangium.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it reaches maturity, the sporophyte
produces one more sporangia, which are the
[SPEAKER_00]: organs that produce the diploid spore
mother cells, or sporesites.
[SPEAKER_00]: These divide by a special process called
meiosis that reduces the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes by half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, we're crossing this line here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The initial results in four single-celled
haploid spores, each containing n pairs of
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see here, four spores here,
each being haploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started with 2n.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to each one of these being
n, and four of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving along, single-celled haploid spore
germinates, dividing by the normal process
[SPEAKER_00]: of mitosis, which maintains the number of
chromosomes at n.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're maintaining in this box,
even though mitosis is occurring,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these cells are dividing, they're
still haploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still haploid cells here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything on this side of the line is
haploid, remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result is a multicellular haploid
organism called the gametophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the key part here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's multicellular haploid organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the gametophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the gametophyte because it produces
the gametes, so kind of an easy way to
[SPEAKER_00]: remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Progressing here, the last step.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it reaches maturity, the gametophyte
produces one or more gametangia,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are the organs that produce haploid
gametes.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least one kind of gamete poses some
mechanism for reaching the other gamete in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to fuse with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just gave the example here of the
sperm and the egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highlight it in the box here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When these come together, that's the
process of fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to take an n and an n to form
a 2n, which is a diploid zygote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the process will repeat itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know initially this can be a little
confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to review this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've found an excellent study guide
resource here, provided the links here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, at the description, you can
click on the slides and directly click on
[SPEAKER_00]: these links to be able to give you some
information here, which I think will be
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful in describing this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried to go through it in an
organized fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, you may have to rewatch this or
pause it at certain times, but hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: this was helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's helpful in explaining what is a
pretty complex topic.
