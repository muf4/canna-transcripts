[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University student
series video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see preparing a growing
area in EZCloner before plant material is
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to get everything all
set up ahead of time before you go out and
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest the plants, even though that's the
fun part, because you want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's mechanically working and
ready for your clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we're looking at this
student series video here, looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: preparing the growing area just to give
you a little background information,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the general starting material,
and we could see there's a hodgepodge of
[SPEAKER_00]: items here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal for Kiara was to turn this
collection of materials into a functional
[SPEAKER_00]: cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once this task was achieved, then plant
material could be collected, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: would be on a separate video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, it's important to get everything
mechanically checked and working properly,
[SPEAKER_00]: then dial in nutrient concentrations
followed by pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once this is achieved, you can go get the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you cut your plants, you want to be
having the least amount of time before
[SPEAKER_00]: they enter the cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see how Kiara went about setting
up this collection of materials to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: area ready for the soon to be cut clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, we only started out with just the
table and our light support.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to go out and make sure all of
our area were sanitized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wiped down both the top and the
bottom and the surrounding areas to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure it's all sanitized and clean,
ready to go for our plants so that there's
[SPEAKER_01]: no cross contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: We then hung our light ballasts up onto
the light support and connected them to
[SPEAKER_01]: each of our lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, had to individually go through
and plug each of them in, but each light
[SPEAKER_01]: is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using Fluence LED lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made sure to have them evenly spread
out so that all of our plants can get an
[SPEAKER_01]: even amount of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that doesn't happen, then of course,
you're going to have weaker plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we don't want.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one high and we have one low just
because we don't know exactly how tall our
[SPEAKER_01]: cloner is going to be yet, how far they're
going to need to be from the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we have them adjusted
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the good thing about the ratchet
light hangers, because they're adjustable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on how the plant is growing,
you could move them accordingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're at the stage where we would test
out the light before we actually get
[SPEAKER_01]: everything set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like they're working
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now this is the step where we would
grab our cloner and start setting it up on
[SPEAKER_01]: the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: After we're done setting up our lights,
we're going to set up our easy cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first step to do that is to fill it
with as much water as required.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, I'd say, takes about 10 gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we do, we want to take the tap
water that we were planning to use anyways
[SPEAKER_01]: and test it using our guardian meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: This reads for conductivity, pH,
and temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said before, this water is straight
out of the tap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our conductivity is reading low at 120,
quite the opposite for the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's reading a little high at 8.1.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're going to do first is adjust
our conductivity with our cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will help us adjust our conductivity
to be raised higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason that we would choose to do the
conductivity before the pH is that this
[SPEAKER_01]: solution has a direct impact on our pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while we're trying to massively change
our conductivity from 200 somewhere up to
[SPEAKER_01]: 600, we're just dialing in very slightly
with the pH up and down just a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, just make sure we go into
our next step first of adjusting the
[SPEAKER_01]: conductivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we go about adjusting anything with
the water, we want to make sure that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: at a proper level so that our aeroponics
filter actually works.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wouldn't want it to be too high or too
low so that nothing is really working as
[SPEAKER_01]: it should.
[SPEAKER_01]: This wants to spray up at the bottom of
the plants so that each of the roots get
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutrients that they need given up to
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the water level isn't correct,
then this won't function correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just tested it, and it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it works properly, you could see this
because all of it's dripping as it should
[SPEAKER_01]: be.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it wasn't, then we would have to adjust
the water level higher or lower before
[SPEAKER_01]: adding nutrients to make sure it's at the
proper level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we need to raise our conductivity
levels and lower our pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to do this, we're going to add
our clonex clone solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bottle recommends adding 5 to 10
milliliters per each liter of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have my recommended amount
pre-ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to add that slowly in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just going to wait a little bit
to see how it adjusts the conductivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, we can go in with our pH up
and down and fix the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we just wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you can see, our conductivity has
raised to 17.
[SPEAKER_01]: 170, which is the perfect level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our pH is at a 6.6, which,
again, is right in the middle of where we
[SPEAKER_01]: want it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just going to wait a little bit
to see how it adjusts.
