[SPEAKER_00]: So in this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to go over mechanically
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're commonly done with industrial hemp,
but to give you some details about exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: how this process occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into mechanical
cannabis plant takedown options regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: for harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, using harvesting equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is advised for large scale operations
doing whole plant harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it just makes the process a whole
lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the basic concept and idea are the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different mechanical options to
growers and you should be aware of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're making sure you select the
proper one to fit your particular growing
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we said, there's different types of
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a couple pictured here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure you select the one that's a
good fit for your particular operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that canvas has a more wood like
kind of fibers and a tobacco plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the same equipment is not advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you've got a lot of tobacco
equipment, don't think you can just go
[SPEAKER_00]: right down your cannabis field and harvest
it in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers sadly learn the hard way
that a lot of damage can be done to their
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco harvesting equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure it's specialized or at least
tested on specifically cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers who have tried to use the same
equipment because plants are similar,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I said, have kind of severe damage to
their tobacco equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Avoid this frustration and added cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're spending time with the
actual crop you intend on harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it looks the same doesn't
mean it can be harvested in exactly the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way with the exact same equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic process, though, is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of the machine is to cut down,
remove, and temporarily store the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant on the way to the trim or drying
process, whatever the growers are
[SPEAKER_00]: choosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp harvesters utilize a tractor with an
implement mounted in the front,
[SPEAKER_00]: side, or even back of the tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many different options, but utilizing
mainly a tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some maintain the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others will chop the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will cut the plant into small pieces
and others will mow the plant at different
[SPEAKER_00]: heights, as we saw in kind of the last
slide there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The method you select should be based on
your intended drying process and end
[SPEAKER_00]: product that you intend to produce because
depending on where that product's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: end up, what kind of you need to produce
in the end may choose how you choose how
[SPEAKER_00]: you go about selecting the harvest process
that's the best fit for your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan the end at the beginning,
as I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're utilizing mechanical harvesting
at the end of the season, keep this in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind when you're planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having plants in straight rows and equally
spaced apart will really help the process
[SPEAKER_00]: in the end of the season when the plants
are quite large.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just, again, paying a little
extra attention to detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That planting process, that springtime,
can really save you a lot of frustration
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going through mechanical
harvesting, just make sure, extra sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're kind of in straight rows to allow
the ease of the equipment to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit you in helping the process instead
of becoming more of a frustration and
[SPEAKER_00]: hindering the efficiency of your
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
