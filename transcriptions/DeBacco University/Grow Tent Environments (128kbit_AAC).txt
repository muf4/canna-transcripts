[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at the grow tent
environments and I have two side by side
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures here of the same grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one with the full spectrum LED light
off and this with it on so you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciation here for the reflectivity of
that kind of mylar backing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not fully set up but these are
becoming very popular for a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the smallest of operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's that same grow tent with the light
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's it all sealed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're becoming very popular because they
can be placed anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very versatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be placed in closets,
bedrooms, spare rooms, and anywhere where
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a basically dead space that has
access to power.
[SPEAKER_00]: This small area is easy to regulate and
many come with many grower friendly
[SPEAKER_00]: options.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes light and charcoal filter
installation very simple, very easy,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of snap fittings on and off you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They offer easy access which can be very
beneficial to the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be, like I said, right in a room,
right in an area that doesn't need
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily outside lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of the reasons why grow tents
have become so popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: They offer ability to fit in a variety of
spaces from very small to very large.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a small little two by two tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of one of the smallest ones
they make and they can go up to a 10 foot
[SPEAKER_00]: by 20 foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very, very large grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two feet by four feet is very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this size is and one of the
reasons why it's popular is it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: easily moved through standard doorways.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just fits through this standard
doorway but it makes it really easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: move from room to room if you so choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that two by four fits in a lot of good
areas and here's kind of the underlying
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ease of these grow tents is that they
have this self-contained internal support
[SPEAKER_00]: structure which allows for attachment
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see different lightings here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it very quick and easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: These grow tents allow a great way to
enter into the growing world because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're nice, small, and contained and can
be done on a budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do their popularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of options becoming
available for these.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also buffer outdoor growers to
continue experimenting even during an off
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find that one key mother plant or
that's kind of want to try something out
[SPEAKER_00]: allows growers to keep growing even if
it's very cold or not conducive outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they do is they create this isolated
environment which can allow for
[SPEAKER_00]: experimentation to occur under constant
and controlled conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the example of some different
models here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be kind of considered as like
growth chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you're able to isolate and test
maybe one variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also due to this isolation, the cloning
propagation environments lend themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: well to grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if large areas for vegetative and
flower growth are used, can easily
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the humidity, easily regulate the
light, and easily keep maybe multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: racks of clones or cuttings in a
relatively small footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: They often require odor control especially
for growing for full term.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep this in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to install a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we typically want to vent this out
the top if possible, but this is an easy
[SPEAKER_00]: access here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps minimize the square feet of
space when you go vertical here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, depending on the operation of
what you're trying to grow, that can also
[SPEAKER_00]: afford you different opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having this tall design though,
even if you're growing only on one level,
[SPEAKER_00]: may be advantageous because it'll allow
easier management for heat, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though these may be a small
footprint of space, you want to watch the
[SPEAKER_00]: power consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to start stringing a bunch of
lights and fans and motors and pumps all
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be careful and be mindful of the
total power consumption of your respective
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
