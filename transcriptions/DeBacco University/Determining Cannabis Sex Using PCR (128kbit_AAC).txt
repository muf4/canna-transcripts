[SPEAKER_00]: So welcome to this DeBacco University
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at determining cannabis sex
using PCR, using the PCR method,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is advantageous because you can tell
whether a plant is male or female well
[SPEAKER_00]: before it actually flowers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll go over some of the methods and
some of the background of this polymerase
[SPEAKER_00]: chain reaction method or PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the video here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we're looking at male and
female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is mostly daisies.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for fiber hemp varieties have been
bred to be monaceous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we use these terms, what does
that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, daisies means that it's producing
either a female plant or it's producing a
[SPEAKER_00]: male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monaceous will produce male and female
flowers on the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with these daisies, we're having these
distinct female and male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Separating out those plants as male and
females at early development stage is
[SPEAKER_00]: useful due to the influence of gender at
agricultural significant traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning, if we were looking at producing
cannabinoids, we definitely want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting for those female plants and
discarding those males.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're eliminating the presence of
pollination, the presence of that pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: to reduce the chance that seeds are
formed, which would greatly reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: total cannabinoids produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we're looking at this PCR method,
what's going to be utilized is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several experiments have been done to
focus on developing reliable molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: marker for sex determination in cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA markers for the detection of male
genotypes is utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we talk about DNA markers,
you might be familiar with running things
[SPEAKER_00]: on a gel with electrophoresis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the utilization of these
different primers that will bind to
[SPEAKER_00]: specific sequences if they're present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And replicate them so that we can
determine whether that small snippet of a
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf is from a male plant or from a female
plant, because those plants contain all
[SPEAKER_00]: those genetic markers at the very early
age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those male genes specifically,
the exact markers used can be debated,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in general concept is the same for
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the markers for the male gene or genes
are found in the plant, will not produce
[SPEAKER_00]: the high cannabinoid flowers that many
growers are growing for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning if we determine it to be a male
plant, a lot of pollens can be produced,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not a lot of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now while I've produced here kind of a
horse example, looking at determining
[SPEAKER_00]: males or females, keep in mind the mare is
considered to be an adult female horse,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a colt is a young male horse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we can see the genetic markers,
we can see our samples, and we can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: make a correlation of what matches with
what here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, may not always be a perfect match,
but we can clearly see S1 sample one here
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly looks like one of the colt or
young male colts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same is basically applied to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why would you use PCR?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the advantage here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, research in pollens chain reaction,
that's PCR, shows could continue in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to find more advanced DNA markers for sex
determination within cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows not only for quick detection
time, but also very accurate results,
[SPEAKER_00]: both things growers are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant sample required is very minimal,
so it can be formed on plants early on in
[SPEAKER_00]: the seedling stage to reduce wasted care,
space and time on plants that will not
[SPEAKER_00]: produce desirable end products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why it can work on plants that
are so small is it's using the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: level and it's able to screen for only,
it really only needs one piece of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: PCR would go through this multiple
thermocycler, this cycle run to amplify,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it amplifies things on an exponential
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So technically having only one sequence of
DNA, it would amplify that to be a very
[SPEAKER_00]: large number to show up on a
electrophoresis gel to be able to use for
[SPEAKER_00]: detection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, can the cost be justified?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of those constant questions
when we're looking particularly at PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we justify the cost of PCR?
[SPEAKER_00]: So while this can be expensive for some
growers, some can justify the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: For larger grow operations, we'll often
set this up in house, meaning they can
[SPEAKER_00]: conduct these PCR treatments within their
own grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after the initial cost, the
reoccurring costs are actually quite
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you purchase everything, reoccurring
costs are quite minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: For medium to small operations,
in-ville samples typically will be sent
[SPEAKER_00]: out for testing for a fee from a testing
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the great question is, in the cost to
benefit analysis, is the cost of the test
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be less than what it would take
to grow that plant to produce flowers to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to identify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is really up to the grower to
look at for their operation, for their
[SPEAKER_00]: particular kind of cost, their particular
potential benefits to make that decision
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the best for their operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
