[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over something
that I think is overlooked by a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, and it's the simple fact of
keeping records.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they don't have to be this large or
this extensive, but this is more important
[SPEAKER_00]: than most growers realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: The systems variable, not every farmer
takes the records exactly the same way,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the key part is that you have
something that you actually will do,
[SPEAKER_00]: some form or some method of actually
documenting what occurred in maintaining
[SPEAKER_00]: those records so that you can refer back
to them in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, obvious question is just, well,
why should I keep records?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the point?
[SPEAKER_00]: In a good year, you want to know what you
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if something worked out really good in
hindsight, you kind of want to have those
[SPEAKER_00]: records so you can repeat that pattern in
future years.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in a bad year, you also want to
know what you did because you want to know
[SPEAKER_00]: why didn't it work or why in hindsight did
I look at a decision I made or something
[SPEAKER_00]: that occurred I didn't react to quick
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's also beneficial then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see whether you have a good
year or a bad year, keeping records is
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in an ugly year or two,
some things you can't control 100%,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you just want to know what happened
and potentially why that occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do I keep records of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's no right or wrong answer to
this, but you want to focus on a few
[SPEAKER_00]: important items or crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil testing is an excellent record to
keep and maintain for each field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Planting dates, that could be started in
the field, that could be started in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, that could be transplant
dates, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, in general, each crop has its
own unique qualities, but when it went
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower, when I noticed fruit set,
when I see insects and disease sightings
[SPEAKER_00]: start to increase, what were my harvest
dates, what were my yields on the field?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a lot of things you can potentially
keep track of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to focus on a few that you're
actually going to do and that will provide
[SPEAKER_00]: you information in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insects and disease scouting, you know
about when a disease came in one year,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can be ready for it and prepare for
it the following year.
[SPEAKER_00]: When was fruit set?
[SPEAKER_00]: When was flowering?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that relate to harvest date?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many days after?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many weeks after did that occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be important for your clients or
your CSA or your people asking,
[SPEAKER_00]: when are you going to have X, Y,
or Z?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give them a better idea in years
to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see that flowering, you know,
oh, it's going to be two weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be three weeks, then I
should have something for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I keep records?
[SPEAKER_00]: A question I get asked a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you want to label the fields with
the name that's logical to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what you call the fields,
I'll call them quote whatever you call
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep the name independent of
the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to call this the
sunflower field because this year you grew
[SPEAKER_00]: sunflowers and next year it will be
tomatoes or corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, oh, the sunflower field,
yeah, I want the corn on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, try to get away from calling it with
the crop that's grown on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call it the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next to the hillside, you know,
the level field, the rocky field,
[SPEAKER_00]: the next to grandma 's house, whatever
works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a problem as long as you know
what that relates to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can break up your fields as small
as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, a nice level area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here you have different fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the name independent of the crop and
label it something logical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can call it North 1, North 2,
North 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to get fancy or creative
with the names, but get away from calling
[SPEAKER_00]: by the crop because ideally you'll be
rotating and that might confuse you in
[SPEAKER_00]: future years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is weather important to keep track of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Weather should be documented, I feel,
in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Individual weather stations you could have
are an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use some public sources that are
probably close enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to find a station that's close to
you, whether you're in the hills or the
[SPEAKER_00]: valley or near the shore or anywhere in
between.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have an area that's close to
you because there'll be little
[SPEAKER_00]: microclimates that develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just gives you a general idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it rained, well, how much rain?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have a simple rain gauge,
something like that, just so you have some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature fluctuations, highs and lows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weather channel provides some data.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some weather underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some other websites that are great
at just documenting what the weather is
[SPEAKER_00]: and just have a way to document and save
that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what suggestions do I have?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I use to keep direct records?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one recommendation is to use a
slideshow format, which makes it easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: import pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the title connects with the date and
it's like a PowerPoint here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Written notes work also.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can type those right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what system do I use?
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a PowerPoint or a slideshow system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it really easy for pictures,
which are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is to put dates in, jot down a
couple of notes, and move on to the next
[SPEAKER_00]: slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: For different fields, I could have
different PowerPoints.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows me to go back and dial in and
really focus in on what may have occurred
[SPEAKER_00]: in that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's a system that works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have to use this?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I do a lot of PowerPoints.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like about it is it's really easy
to put pictures in, which are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, pictures are highly
recommended because even though you're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking a picture of X, later you may be
more interested in Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while you look at this picture,
if you see the older woman or the two guys
[SPEAKER_00]: in a horse, something that you may see
originally may get changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be looking at the tomatoes,
but later when you look back, you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at what weeds are coming in,
or what did the leaves look like,
[SPEAKER_00]: or what was that thing behind it,
or other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing what a picture can tell you
looking back with fresh eyes on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example here, do you see the older
man's face here?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's his nose and mustache.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the young lady's back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's her nose, her eyes, and this would
be her ear, and this would be her hair
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, those pictures, because you
might see something initially,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might refer back to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I take written notes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Written notes can be quick and easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Field notes, quick little thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write on your phone real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whiteboard works too, but be careful these
can get erased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they get wet or rain or water,
they're going to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good for quick little notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if your workers have something
to jot down, or something they see,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could have a little board dedicated to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick little field notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just something quick, easy, what did you
see, what you need to document.
[SPEAKER_00]: All good options just in some way of
taking notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last important point, determine a format
that you'll actually do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Provide helpful information looking back,
and it'll keep yourself organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you want to organize it,
with a crop or by field, what you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do, look at the fruit,
look at the leaves, and other,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to have some sort of format.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll keep you better in tuned with did I
miss something, or did I make sure I write
[SPEAKER_00]: down everything there that I need to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they don't have to be long,
quick little notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole goal is to be able to have
someone to refer back to during the off
[SPEAKER_00]: season so you can better plan for the next
year.
