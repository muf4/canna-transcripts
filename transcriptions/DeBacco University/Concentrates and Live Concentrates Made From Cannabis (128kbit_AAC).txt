[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever wondered about concentrates
and live concentrates made from cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this Tobacco University video will
provide you with some information so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can develop an understanding about these
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at concentrates and live
concentrates made from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, I want to thank CT Pharma here
because they're providing current and
[SPEAKER_00]: publicly available analytical reports for
the products they produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: The descriptions, options, and uses are
intended on this video to provide an
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of some of the end products
of that cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to understand at the end
that you should have an analytical report
[SPEAKER_00]: with anything you're looking at purchasing
associated with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: CT Pharma does a great job of showing
that, and I'll show you an example of that
[SPEAKER_00]: at the very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, what's the description of our
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are concentrates and are live
concentrates?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they can be extracted into many
different ways and come in all different
[SPEAKER_00]: consistencies and textures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are highly potent concentrate mass
that often has a color similar to like a
[SPEAKER_00]: butter or honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: There also are many different forms of
extracts ranging from glass-like textures
[SPEAKER_00]: or shatter to soft buttery textures such
as batter to ultimately a soft crumbly
[SPEAKER_00]: texture as the name implies, a crumble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live concentrates are extracted in a
unique method involving flash freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This method preserves many of the flavors
and trichomes from the original plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material when compared to other original
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now concentrates and live concentrates,
what are some of the options?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just kind of a brief overview
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's found on CT Pharma's site.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to check them out if you
want to learn more, but there's several
[SPEAKER_00]: options and we see them all kind of listed
here, both concentrates located at the top
[SPEAKER_00]: and then live concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's important to keep in mind is if we
look at the strength of all of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are listed as high simply because
this is a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are concentrating just that
profile, concentrating that CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrating that THC in the sense that a
little can go a very long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what are the uses of these
concentrates?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, all the concentrates available on CT
Pharma can be vaporized or combined with
[SPEAKER_00]: flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vaporizers are available in many forms
such as electronic like an e-rig or glass
[SPEAKER_00]: versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I talked about earlier,
that is kind of important of the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: paperwork that goes along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're seeing our microbial
analysis, heavy metal, micro toxin,
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide, all passing those, as well as
the terpene and cannabinoid profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people will just look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have to be mindful of matching up
product descriptions and lot numbers to
[SPEAKER_00]: also the passing of all of the
microbiology, pesticides, micro toxin
[SPEAKER_00]: testing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this often comes summarized on a
label or should come summarized on a
[SPEAKER_00]: labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here, but it's important you're
looking at the label, realizing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding what it's showing and also
having access to or knowing where to find
[SPEAKER_00]: the original documentation where those
numbers came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just, again, that combination
there of being an informed consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
