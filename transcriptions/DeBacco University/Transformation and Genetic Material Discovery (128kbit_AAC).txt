[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're gonna look at the
transformation and genetic material
[SPEAKER_00]: discovery process and a couple of the key
scientists and experiments that they did
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of discover that DNA was a genetic
coding of the material that cells use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the Griffith experiment
here that occurred in around 1928,
[SPEAKER_00]: he discovered that transformation,
this concept of transformation,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is gonna be an important concept not
only for this lecture series, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: when we get to biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_00]: His experiment demonstrated that bacteria
get DNA through a process called
[SPEAKER_00]: transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So exactly what is this and what process
is this and we still use it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the very basics of what transformation
is is defined as a gene from a bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: cell is moved to another bacteria cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a blue bacteria and a green
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the blue bacteria here produces
something that we find desirable or want
[SPEAKER_00]: this green bacteria to be able to produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it could be that this lives in a
conditions that are just not conducive to
[SPEAKER_00]: something and the green bacteria here is
an area that we need to find or fill a
[SPEAKER_00]: niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can transform this green bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a plasmid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember from prokaryotes which bacteria
are, they contain plasmids which are small
[SPEAKER_00]: circular DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take the gene of interest from this
cell here and we can splice it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: plasmid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plasmid then can be inserted back
into the original cell and that cell can
[SPEAKER_00]: then be transformed, meaning this cell
here is now producing the substance that
[SPEAKER_00]: this cell was originally producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've transformed this bacteria into now
kind of a merger of the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the structure of the green
bacteria but the producing qualities of
[SPEAKER_00]: this blue circular bacteria and this is
through the plasmid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process of the second bacteria cell
taking up the new genetic material,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what's called transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to go into this in more detail,
I have a pretty detailed explanation
[SPEAKER_00]: provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the process is still the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an initial cell here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case our gene of interest is the
small yellow region.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're inserting that into our rectangular
blue cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it's taking up that gene of interest,
putting it into its plasmid and
[SPEAKER_00]: replicating it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see the different phases that
it's gone through and now this cell now
[SPEAKER_00]: has or able to have the same genetics,
produce the same proteins, the same end
[SPEAKER_00]: result as the cell originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've transformed this bacteria is what
the process is called.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another explanation here, it doesn't have
to be a cell to cell transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could purify plasmid DNA and here we
have a test tube with plasmid DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could insert that into a cell and then
grow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the genes expressed by the
bacteria could be antibiotic resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: for selecting for certain bacteria
colonies is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this occurs in nature in general
sense when we're looking at genetic and
[SPEAKER_00]: antibiotic resistance developing within a
gene pool of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the Griffith experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacterium exists in two strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: He studied two strains here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He studied the S and the R strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The S strain here is smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Key part here is this can cause disease
and death in animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rough strain here is harmless and
doesn't produce qualities that make it any
[SPEAKER_00]: reason for concern for animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animals can survive just fine with the R
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we call harmless or
non-virulent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The S strain, put it in red here,
can cause disease and this is one to watch
[SPEAKER_00]: out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it produces a polysaccharide
coat, the glycocalyx, and can cause
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all glycocalyxes or polysaccharides
coats automatically cause disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this particular bacteria strain,
it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, the rough colonies, they don't
produce that exterior coat and therefore
[SPEAKER_00]: they're considered harmless and they have
this rough strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the experiment that was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rough strain, non-virulent, purified that,
injected it into a mouse, waited for a
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time, and the mouse was just
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That smooth strain is virulent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it causes disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that's injected into a mouse,
sadly the mouse dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if we take this smooth strain and
we heat kill it, we put it in some boiling
[SPEAKER_00]: water, we see the denaturing, we see the
proteins denature, we see the shape
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely changes, and we inject this
heat killed smooth strain into the rat or
[SPEAKER_00]: mouse and it ends up living.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've basically taken away the virulent
strain for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what's most interesting is that
when we take a combination of the rough
[SPEAKER_00]: strain, which didn't cause disease,
and the heat killed smooth strain that
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't cause disease and we mix them
together, we develop a concoction here
[SPEAKER_00]: that was added to this mouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, this mouse ended up dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we notice here is a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two portions that alone did not
cause death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most mouse live in both those cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: When combined, we notice that the mouse
dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's similar result to the smooth strain,
virulent strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what's caused here, what's
potential reason for this, is that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at these bacteria, these two
different strains, can cause some
[SPEAKER_00]: transformation to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetics from the heat killed smooth
strain still exist and they can be
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred and taken up by the rough
strain and these two can exchange material
[SPEAKER_00]: back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the key part here that's causing
the mouse to die, causing a virulent end
[SPEAKER_00]: result.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Avery experiment was very interested
in this particular experimental trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: He and his colleagues prepared the same
mixture of dead S and live R bacteria as
[SPEAKER_00]: Griffith did, then subject to various
experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the experiments reveal that the
properties of the transferring principle
[SPEAKER_00]: resemble those of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, we're still trying to discover
what the genetic material is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same chemistry and physical properties as
DNA, not affected by lipid and protein
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction, not destroyed by protein or
RNA digesting enzymes, but destroyed by
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA digesting enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of image shows a great visual
representation of the Avery experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll look at that in the next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here, we have our mixture of the S
strain bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, this is the smooth strain,
it's virulent, causes death.
[SPEAKER_00]: They added different enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recognize those by the last three
letters, ACE.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA, ACE, RNA, ACE, lipase, prodase,
and some other enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, prodase breaks down proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lipase breaks down lipids or fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA, ACE, breaks down RNA, and DNA,
ACE, breaks down protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lipase breaks down DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: When these were added to the different
test tubes here and then added back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: R strain, tests were conducted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, in all of these cases,
the mouse sadly ended up dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when DNA ACE was added and broke
down the DNA, we mixed with the R strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: the mouse was alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because this DNA ACE broke down
the DNA and then allowed the mouse to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive because it took away the virulence
of the S strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last experiment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we need to understand just the
basic structure of a virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: A virus is very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a protein coat with DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's DNA wrapped in a protein coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can look very different, but the
structure is basically the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some look like these alien spider-looking
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are more like a rod shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some might be more spherical.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part is they all are a protein
coat with DNA on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some also can be RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this Hershey Chase experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viruses that infect bacteria have a simple
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A DNA core is surrounded by a protein
coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hershey and Chase used two different
radioactive isotopes to label the protein
[SPEAKER_00]: in DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They incubated the labeled viruses with
host bacteria and revealed that only DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: entered the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, DNA was considered the genetic
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an example of what they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to flip to the next slide to
give you a little bit more detailed look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Hershey Chase experiment of 1952.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two bacteriophages here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our two viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, sulfur labeled protein
capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outside here is labeled radioactively
just for tracking purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In here, the green is the DNA is labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both allowed to infect the cell,
both allowed to kind of reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end, centrifuging that's
spinning, the bacteria cells were labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that had, in this case,
the sulfur labeled protein, the outer coat
[SPEAKER_00]: that was labeled, they noticed no kind of
radioactive labeled materials in the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in this case, where the DNA was
labeled and they purified the cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: they did notice the radioactive labeling
present inside the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what provided them evidence that
it wasn't the protein at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And proteins were originally thought to be
the source of genetic information because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so many different proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA only has four different bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought no way could that be
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in fact, DNA was the genetic
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: By labeling the DNA in the viruses and
only noticing that located here and not
[SPEAKER_00]: the protein outer shell, they concluded
that DNA was the genetic material.
Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
