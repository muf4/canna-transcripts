[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tobacco University video,
we're going to look at a slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: different spin on outdoor production of
cannabis, having it being grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into growing cannabis
outdoors in containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, this is similar to direct
soil planting, but of course, a little
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Planting cannabis into containers is
common for indoor applications,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is gaining popularity with outdoor
growers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is this trend kind of occurring?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is part because growers have
greater control over what the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in, better control over the
substrate here, because you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it into those specific containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, with the increase in fabric
containers' popularity, these have become
[SPEAKER_00]: more cost effective and are able to be
utilized by more growers, as we see in the
[SPEAKER_00]: picture right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the process is basically the same as
planting in soil, but there's a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more initial work to kind of fill the
containers up with your chosen substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, container planting's advantages is
that if the soil is not conducive for
[SPEAKER_00]: plant production, containers make a great
alternative to be able to use a field that
[SPEAKER_00]: would otherwise not be profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weeding is often reduced as well,
as we can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants can also be staged in a cold frame,
able to push them, get them a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger a little earlier in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me talk about weeding reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see some stone being utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also use greenhouse-grade weed
block as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: To eliminate any weeds growing in the
pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though, of course, there'll be some weeds
to kind of take out of the containers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're definitely reducing your
overall area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the growing substrate is under more
exact control of the grower, and even
[SPEAKER_00]: though you can amend the soil,
here you're able to amend ahead of time
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe purchase specific substrate to
fill the containers with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, however, there also are some
disadvantages, and the first one being,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, the initial cost, looking at
the containers, the time and labor it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes to fill those containers,
and the use of an irrigation system,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you could go through hand watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, the disadvantage would be
the time it would take to go through and
[SPEAKER_00]: water the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's look at this field, kind of from
a field perspective, to give you a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more information and relate it a
little bit better to a field application
[SPEAKER_00]: of growing cannabis outdoors, but in
containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're looking here at the soil,
looking at a very dry surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you dig down, there is a lot of water
just below the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, of course, to everyone's
favorite rocks, which makes it just a
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult area to grow in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite being all clear-cut and access to
the sun, this grower decided to take the
[SPEAKER_00]: leap and still grow in the field,
but grow in a way that might be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decided to grow in grow bags on a large
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's over a thousand here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it makes it great to be able to
control the conditions and doesn't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with all of the soil issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants were started in the soil initially,
but then noticed that they weren't doing
[SPEAKER_00]: so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the transition was made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since being transplanted, the plants
have definitely responded in a positive
[SPEAKER_00]: manner, which is great to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only downfall with kind of making this
adjustment later in the season is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they are happening to resort to hand
watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's a very laborious task with a
thousand over a thousand plants here that
[SPEAKER_00]: can take upwards of two to three hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's just important to keep in mind
when you're going through and making a
[SPEAKER_00]: change like that, to keep in mind that the
plants still need their water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're going to be dependent on
you for that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are plans to kind of go through
and automate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there's always room for improvement
and adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the plants respond, it makes it
that much more enjoyable and that much
[SPEAKER_00]: more apt to kind of put the time in to
ensure that they're happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when the plants are happy,
it always seems like the growers are
[SPEAKER_00]: happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so if you're having challenges
growing in the field, well, this is
[SPEAKER_00]: another way you can grow in the field,
but have a little bit more control over
[SPEAKER_00]: your conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a bunch of these grow bags
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the cannabis plants growing in
grow bags, all nicely lined up to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to walk through.
[SPEAKER_00]: In field application here, we've got a lot
of access to natural sun, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil can be amended.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be very specific on what you put in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at approximately five gallons or
so volume of soil here and looking out in
[SPEAKER_00]: total, this area is over a thousand
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there's a lot of labor that goes into
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you have control over that,
you can help improve your yields,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is well worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trying to grow in soil that you're
just not going to get the yields from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is just an example of how growers
can kind of work with what they've got and
[SPEAKER_00]: make adjustments to help improve that
yield in the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're looking at why a grower may go
to grow bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is a perfect example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing this giant large rock indicating
it's been removed from the field and this
[SPEAKER_00]: field is very rocky.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, after clear cutting,
it can be very tough to kind of grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: soil after plants, trees have been in
there for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also looking at some of the
plants and that can help give us an
[SPEAKER_00]: indication of the natural plants and what
would want to grow here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see a lot of ferns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ferns indicate probably a lot of shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, we have some rutting that
went on with the equipment in this general
[SPEAKER_00]: area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the soil is very wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Near me on this other side, we can see
that there is a stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if I pan around this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Near me here in the backdrop here,
you can see a stream that is running by.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is again an indication that this
soil is probably going to retain a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture, which is going to be great
during a dry year, but make it a challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when that water might be so
close to the surface, it could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge to get roots to be able to
breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when we have all these conditions and
the grower did try to put the plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil initially, pan around here,
well, they noticed that they had struggled
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, seeing them struggle at that point,
it was justified to be able to kind of go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and plant this large planting with
grow bags to take advantage of the area
[SPEAKER_00]: that had been cleared to access the sun,
but that limited the amount that they
[SPEAKER_00]: could get based on soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this gave the grower control over what
was in the soil and ultimate control over
[SPEAKER_00]: plant performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, a lot of people may consider grow bags
to be a smaller operation where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to grow in a grow tent,
but this just shows how you can grow in a
[SPEAKER_00]: large field application with grow bags if
you're willing to supply some of the labor
[SPEAKER_00]: and to go through the work to set it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it justified?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, looking at the soil type,
justify growing grow bags, you can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, again, just shows a large area that
can be planted in grow bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can justify it with labor,
you can see the plants can do quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're establishing themselves nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grower has control over what goes into
that soil there and adjustments can be
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Music you you you
