[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a brief overview of
the integratory system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though you may not know initially
what that means by looking at the picture
[SPEAKER_00]: here, you can probably guess we're going
to be dealing something to do with our own
[SPEAKER_00]: skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Integrate actually means skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And skin and its appendages make up the
integratory system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's a system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not just talking about skin,
so are the appendages, such as nails and
[SPEAKER_00]: hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there'll be future videos on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skin is a cutaneous membrane and is our
largest organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our skin alone accounts for about 7% of
our body weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of important to keep this in mind
that this is covering our entire body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes up 7% of our body weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for every 100 pounds, you have about 7
pounds of just skin weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be talking about the dermis
and the epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this cutaneous membrane is a
combination of both of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this system I'm talking about,
remember we're also involving nails and
[SPEAKER_00]: also hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So regions of the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to go over a couple, two distinct
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the epidermis, epi meaning top,
and then the dermis being the lower level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the lowest level here is the
subcutaneous level or the hypodermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fatty layer and it lies deep
within the layers of the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first two distinctive regions are the
epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the layer that you can physically
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have the dermis below that
and then the subcutaneous or the
[SPEAKER_00]: hypodermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're kind of used interchangeably
lying beneath that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tends to be fatty, meaning it
contains adipose tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the functions of the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a couple of major ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cushions insulates and acts as a
waterproofing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protects the skin from chemicals,
heat, cold, bacteria, and screens UV
[SPEAKER_00]: light, ultraviolet light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think of it like a spacesuit as
offering protection from us from the harsh
[SPEAKER_00]: outside environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Synthesizes vitamin D with UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it puts together vitamin D.
[SPEAKER_00]: It uses sunlight to help us assemble that
necessary vitamin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulates body heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps with the adipose tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prevents unnecessary water loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And contains sensory receptor or nerve
endings involved in the integumentary
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple major functions here
of the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on, it's a nice picture of the
integument system and its components.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see this image quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: While initially, right now, some of these
terms may sound a little bit unfamiliar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, by the end of this lecture
series, a lot of these will make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll be able to identify where
they're located, and also their important
[SPEAKER_00]: function for the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the epidermis, for instance,
is the most top layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stratified scrimmage epithelium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the type of cells is what it
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several distinct layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's two different types of skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's what we call thick skin,
which is five layers and found on the
[SPEAKER_00]: palms of your hand and soles of your feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then thin skin, which is four layers
and basically covered the rest of your
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thin skin also is where hair follicles are
located.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thick skin is five layers and does not
contain hair follicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you just a quick comparison of
thin versus thick skin, we can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: epidermis here thickness on the thin skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where the skin is thicker,
you can see that epidermal layer being
[SPEAKER_00]: much larger, much thicker in that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So skin contains four basic types of
tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epithelium, connective tissue,
which is part of the dermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Muscle tissue and nervous tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, I'm just going to kind of go
over those basic tissue types.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be other videos that go through
and discuss the muscle system,
[SPEAKER_00]: muscular system, and the nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, I just know it's made of
these four basic types of tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dermal layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting a little deeper into the
skin now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the second major layer,
strong, flexible tissue, often referred to
[SPEAKER_00]: as the hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the animal hide here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is made up of mostly the dermal
layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rich supply of nerves and the vesicles
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Critical role in temperature regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has two layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's papillae layer, which involves the
dermal papillae, and the rectal layer,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a deeper layer and composes about
80% of the thickness of the actual dermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All flexure lines are creases in the
palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyone can read palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can tell me my future there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is looking at the dermal layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's giving the actual ridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, again, a little deeper here
to the subcutaneous layer, or hypodermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These terms are kind of just
interchangeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, hypodermis is actually
Greek for below skin, and subcutaneous is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually Latin for below skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those translate to the same,
just again, one is really preferred over
[SPEAKER_00]: the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be able to recognize both.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is composed of loose connective
tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adipose is an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stabilizes the skin position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loosely attached to the dermal and muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're down here in the lower
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of tying this in,
this upper epidermis and dermal layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also containing our veins and arteries
and some of our nerve endings.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this subcutaneous layer, hypodermis
contains fat cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different patterns of accumulation based
on male or female for those fat deposits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Provides thermal insulation that the
adipose tissue is really great about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cushions underlying organs,
another important function.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can remember the hypodermis reserves
hypodermic needles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get a needle or an injection,
it's being injected down into this
[SPEAKER_00]: hypodermal layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we've seen this picture before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully now we're starting to put
together a couple pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other videos, you'll notice where some
of these other terms are also mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this entire image does not make
sense to you now, hopefully we're starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to put pieces and bits together.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as kind of key items, you should
know at least from this lecture,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at what's to be able to identify
the epidermis, dermis, hypodermis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of the other regions will become
in the future there.
