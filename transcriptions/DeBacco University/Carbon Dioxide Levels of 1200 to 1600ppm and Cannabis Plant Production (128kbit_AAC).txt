[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've chosen to elevate your carbon
dioxide levels to 1,200 to 1,600 parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million, this Tobacco University video is
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into carbon dioxide
levels of 1,200 to 1,600 parts per million
[SPEAKER_00]: and its relation to cannabis plant
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, those levels,
keep in mind that 400 parts per million is
[SPEAKER_00]: normal atmospheric conditions and
elevating the levels above this will
[SPEAKER_00]: require the use of several pieces of
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to increase overall plant
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can see here, closer to atmospheric
conditions, the same plant grown in just
[SPEAKER_00]: over 1,200 parts per million, you see a
much larger amount of biomass accumulated
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the equipment list is you're going to
need a carbon dioxide source, a method of
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery, a monitoring system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are other videos on this
channel that will focus on those aspects,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this video focuses on the chosen range
and its impact on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the image I provided here just shows
if you were to use a bottle system,
[SPEAKER_00]: some pieces of equipment you might want to
be considering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that 1,200 to 1,600 parts per million,
growers want to ensure the plants do not
[SPEAKER_00]: run out of carbon dioxide to maximize the
levels they count for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, however, this can be corrected by
ensuring a quality controller and proper
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor placement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers that want to ensure,
want to make sure there's no chance my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants running out of carbon dioxide,
maximizing the levels basically will
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure they're not going to be carbon
dioxide deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even at these high levels, there's no risk
of workers being in this space for
[SPEAKER_00]: extended periods of time because levels
about 5,000 are considered to start being
[SPEAKER_00]: hazardous to humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not just add extra carbon dioxide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're looking at, we don't want to
add extra carbon dioxide because carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide levels beyond what the plant can
utilize can result in ethylene production,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can cause early plant ripening and
other speed aging effects we see here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the GIF.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at ethylene synthesis and
sensitivity in crops, we see some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these would be way higher elevated
levels, but this is why we want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: conscious of how much carbon dioxide we're
adding because adding just more will
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially cause problems and not any
benefit to the plants there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's over adding?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when carbon dioxide is over added,
this can result in not only wasting carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide, but it doesn't offer any benefits
to the plant, can actually increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: chance at reducing overall yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's a good idea to have an
idea what the range you're shooting for is
[SPEAKER_00]: and to make sure you're staying within
that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want to go too excessive and just
keep that in mind that 400 parts per line
[SPEAKER_00]: is atmospheric conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, looking at 400 being the kind of
minimal and then going up to maybe 1400
[SPEAKER_00]: and much beyond that, you could see all of
these lines start to plateau and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not really getting much of a yield benefit
at those levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to take all these factors into
consideration as you make your decision
[SPEAKER_00]: for your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
