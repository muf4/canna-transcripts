[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this tobacco university video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go over a whole plant harvest
process of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tune in at the end where we'll see a great
example of an entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're looking at implementing this
particular method, it might be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the whole plant
harvest process regarding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the whole plant harvest is a
very simple process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many growers prefer to a whole plant
harvest simply because it's easy and does
[SPEAKER_00]: not require a lot of detailed or very
attentive eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking the whole plant, cut it,
move it, next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially for larger operations that may
have a variety of people harvesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a very easy and standardized approach
and it's simple for everyone to follow the
[SPEAKER_00]: same process.
[SPEAKER_00]: A head grower can kind of come in,
say we're taking all these plants and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of repeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut the entire plant down, transport,
repeat that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut the entire plant down, transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no looking at determining,
oh, is this bud ripe or is that bud ripe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that plant's gone, go right ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also allows one pass through the field
or the area of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: With whole plant harvesting, growers also
do not have to return to the planting
[SPEAKER_00]: site, which is a great advantageous,
at least for the main crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're growing outdoors like this,
it might be playing a cover crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at least they won't be dealing with
the main crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvesting the entire plant also allows
for better timing of the flushing process
[SPEAKER_00]: along with the removal of irrigation
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, if a block of plants is
removed and this area can become
[SPEAKER_00]: completely cleaned right after harvest to
prepare for the following steps as an
[SPEAKER_00]: entire area, not to like go through just
one little section, large areas can be
[SPEAKER_00]: done, which can be very efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: For outdoor locations, this could be
getting a cover crop planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're an indoor location,
this could be cleaning and sterilizing the
[SPEAKER_00]: area to get ready for another round or
grow cycle of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that whole plant harvest usually can
mean whole plant drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the removal of the entire plant,
this allows the entire plant to dry at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since there is a lot of plant material,
this can often mean a slower drying
[SPEAKER_00]: process, which actually some prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here where there is some trimming that
was initially done, but we can see here
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much the entire plants are being
strung up here to dry in this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: dry room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're making concentrates,
as an example, if the end product of the
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest is going to be concentrates,
then whole plant harvest is advised since
[SPEAKER_00]: the optimum rightness does not need to be
as exact for each individual bud as if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going, for example, for drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, indoor whole plant harvesting,
so if you're an indoor grower looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant harvesting, they have it a
little easier since they can control the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment around the plant and can time
the exact harvest day and time within the
[SPEAKER_00]: week and in advance in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means you can plan, okay,
put it on the calendar in two weeks or
[SPEAKER_00]: taking down flower room four, for example,
and it doesn't matter if it's raining
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, if it's hot sun outside,
if it's snowing outside, if you're in a
[SPEAKER_00]: northern location, you can plan that ahead
of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really is advantageous for the
indoor controlled environment growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can put that date on the calendar and
go through and take all those plants down.
[SPEAKER_00]: For outdoor growers, they have a little
bit more of a challenge, especially for
[SPEAKER_00]: large scale growers, taking the plant at
once saves time, labor, and money,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we can see that it is a lot of labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be aware of the weather, wet and cold
temperatures, and the increased odds of
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, for example, bud rot developing
in the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Removing the plants as a whole reduces
potential for disease spread and other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in the growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's advantageous for
outdoor growers if you can handle the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire plants to go through and to remove
the entire plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this grow operation right here,
pretty standardized size of plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now going to get into going outdoors
looking at one plant that you may want to
[SPEAKER_00]: have second thoughts if you're considering
doing an entire plant harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: though it would be possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm often asked how big can a cannabis
plant grow outside in southern New
[SPEAKER_00]: England?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is a fine specimen right here
showing the effect that good soil can have
[SPEAKER_00]: on total plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just one plant to give you that
general size orientation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's producing quite a number of buds,
maybe not the largest, most prolific buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for something that was just kind of
grown outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this kind of compost pile does provide
you with some idea of just how big these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants can get, even in southern New
England that may have a more limiting
[SPEAKER_00]: season than other regions in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
