[SPEAKER_00]: If you've considered using biodegradable
pots for cannabis production, this Tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: University video is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's go over some biodegradable
pots for cannabis production and let you
[SPEAKER_00]: know some of the options you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so first off I want you to
realize that there is some variability
[SPEAKER_00]: with biodegradable pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different types of base
materials that fall under this category.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's common brands materials such as,
for example, cow pots are made from cow
[SPEAKER_00]: manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jiffy pots are made from wool pulp and
peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straw pots are made from, as the name
would imply, straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same with coconut fiber,
also made from coconut fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: No real surprise there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind some of these also have
binders that are added to them to help
[SPEAKER_00]: hold them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, for example, the coconut coir
might not be something you're used to
[SPEAKER_00]: growing it as a media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at here as a pot, it has a very
kind of solid-like feel to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a binder in there so it can be
very thin but still hold together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to affect some of the
properties of these pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now starting with the first one here,
looking at just cow pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many variations to meet different demands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do break down in one year if used in
field applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't accumulate over a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do break down over the course of a
growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not well suited for full
growing cycle production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is if you're growing in
a greenhouse or high tunnel, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow in one of these containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to break down over time,
which is a good thing if you're planting
[SPEAKER_00]: them directly into the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said many variations, many different
sizes, which is great for holding
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings for a certain duration of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there are Jiffy pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this pretty much is considered to be
like the standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the rate of degradation is longer
than one growing season if being used in
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor field applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to keep in mind that this will
result in overall accumulation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: material if you use it year after year.
[SPEAKER_00]: After year in the same field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while, yes, does it break down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but it does take longer than a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there are straw pots made from straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do break down quickly, but they're
not well suited for long term growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be very flimsy, aside when it
comes to handling and transport of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants while in these containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're basically straw wrapped
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a binder there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots can penetrate through them pretty
easily, but they are not really have a
[SPEAKER_00]: great integrity to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can fall apart fairly easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's those coconut pots here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This last one that we'll talk about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots can often pass right through the
fibers, as we see here on the lower side.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if used in outdoor locations,
these pots really do not break down very
[SPEAKER_00]: much at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feel as if they can almost be reused
due to the lack of degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while they are touted as being great
and usable using material, if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: planting them outdoors, you want to be
mindful that at the end of the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may be able to find basically the same
pot originally planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind so you don't have
these containers becoming a potential
[SPEAKER_00]: problem, particularly in field
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
