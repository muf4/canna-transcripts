[SPEAKER_00]: This can be a problem that a lot of
growers may not want to admit to it's
[SPEAKER_00]: called the more on more on or more on
Mistake here for the approach to gardening
[SPEAKER_00]: and growing crops We are simply just over
adding or adding just more nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking this that's going to fix your
problem So the problem with over
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizing is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not always better It's a can be a
waste of money can potentially damage your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and can also increase the odds for
environmental contamination all bad things
[SPEAKER_00]: here So the goal is to be in the
sufficiency range so we kind of see a
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient here Increasing concentration of
nutrient increasing plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting the maximum plant growth
This is called the sufficiency or optimum
[SPEAKER_00]: range at this level the nutrients as a
plant has enough to function and develop
[SPEAKER_00]: properly But not at toxic levels,
so this sufficiency range is the should be
[SPEAKER_00]: the target of growers Now we get into
something called luxury consumption,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is When plants take up more of a
nutrient that is needed so we see we're
[SPEAKER_00]: within our sufficiency range here However
at the very top here This is where the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants just taking in more nutrients than
it needs and especially if you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at leafy greens this can be an issue here
with Excess nitrogen being taken up by the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant because of the grower overfeeding
that particular nutrient There's something
[SPEAKER_00]: called a toxic level and this is when the
nutrients can actually harm the plants so
[SPEAKER_00]: we're getting on a sufficiency range and
we're getting That toxicity range and what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens here is that plant growth will
actually decrease so over adding certain
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients will actually cause a decreased
plant growth Now that decrease can be it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the same as here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at deficiency symptoms
However to create a deficiency would
[SPEAKER_00]: simply add nutrients to bring it up to the
sufficiency range When we're in a toxic
[SPEAKER_00]: situation it can be very hard to remove
One particular nutrient inadequate amounts
[SPEAKER_00]: to get back to the sufficiency range a lot
of times these toxicity range is grower
[SPEAKER_00]: induced So we want to be mindful of what
we're adding so that we don't induce this
[SPEAKER_00]: problem in our own grow Something called a
critical level and this is the point in
[SPEAKER_00]: which there's no longer a fertilizer
response What this means is that at very
[SPEAKER_00]: low levels here or maximum yield we're
adding fertilizer getting better yield
[SPEAKER_00]: getting better yield getting better yield
Until we reach this critical level we
[SPEAKER_00]: reach that theoretical 100% yield adding
any more fertilizer You're a lot less
[SPEAKER_00]: likely or in this case not going to get
any increase in yield so at this point on
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond this Critical level you're
increasing your input costs for no return
[SPEAKER_00]: and this can be a major issue with Wasting
money wasting time wasting resources and
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially contaminating the environment
So what I think about is sustainability
[SPEAKER_00]: and being as close to that critical level
as possible Will help ensure not hurting
[SPEAKER_00]: yields with also potentially reducing
impacts on the environment Now what does
[SPEAKER_00]: this look like in a kind of a corn
comparison here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of research done on corn When we
have low levels, we see this corn doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: look as healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more spindly It's kind of lighter
green in the excess dark green kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole way down to the base here the
optimum conditions Yes, a couple lower
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves are turning brown and that's fine
corn here We're looking at filling in that
[SPEAKER_00]: ear that last bit of nutrients there being
pulled out of the bottom portion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stock to fill the ear This would be the
optimal amount of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be the least amount of waste
and the best yield for the least amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: input So it's important to keep this in
mind To be able not to over utilize or
[SPEAKER_00]: just add more and think that's going to
solve your problems Because it could just
[SPEAKER_00]: simply create more You
