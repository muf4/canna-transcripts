[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another DeBaco University
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here looking at identifying basic bones of
the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to look at parts of
the skeletal system and some of the major
[SPEAKER_00]: bones that you should be able to recognize
and identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well starting in general with bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well bones are comprised the vertebral
skeleton of animals which protects the
[SPEAKER_00]: various organs of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember this is an endoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks kind of very porous as we can see
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those pores when the organism is
living it will produce red and white blood
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also store minerals provide structure
and support for the body and enable
[SPEAKER_00]: mobility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bones come in a variety of shapes and
sizes and have complex internal and
[SPEAKER_00]: external structures that's lightweight but
yet strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go over some of those
focusing mainly on the human body here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're classifying our bones we
have four general classifications as
[SPEAKER_00]: presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the long bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which include the femur, tibia,
fibula, humerus, radius and ulna.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have short bones and those are the
carpals of the wrist and tarsals of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ankle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our flat bones like for example
our skull or sternum and irregular bones
[SPEAKER_00]: such as our vertebrae or our pelvis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have the skull and mandible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the skull is a bony structure that
forms the head and vertebrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It supports the structure of the face
provides a protective cavity for the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over here we see a collection of
skulls.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mandible is the lower jaw or typically
referred to as the jaw bone and is the
[SPEAKER_00]: largest strongest bone in the human face
and it holds the lower teeth in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the image directly over here we
notice it's highlighted in green to
[SPEAKER_00]: highlight exactly where the mandible is
located in distinct relation to the skull.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have something called vertebrae and
these are individual bones that comprise
[SPEAKER_00]: the vertebral column that has curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The natural curves add more strength and a
straight line so it can support the weight
[SPEAKER_00]: of the body and provide balance needed to
walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sections of the vertebral column
include the cervical, thoracic and the
[SPEAKER_00]: lumbar regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the cervical, here's the
thoracic, here's the lumbar and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: fused areas way down here would be the
pelvic region in addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the rib cage and rib cage
functions to protect the heart and lungs
[SPEAKER_00]: in the thoracic cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also aids in respiration provide support
for the upper limbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three main classifications of ribs based
on different points of attachment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our true or fixed ribs that have a
direct point of attachment to the sternum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our false ribs and these kind of
have this kind of cartilage connection
[SPEAKER_00]: that then attaches to the sternum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the floating ribs here
which are simply not attached in any way
[SPEAKER_00]: to the sternum.
[SPEAKER_00]: However this image is a slightly
inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This rib here should have a piece of
cartilage attaching it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should only be two floating ribs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those attachment points, those again those
true ribs, one through seven are attached
[SPEAKER_00]: to that coastal cartilage directly to that
sternum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The false ribs here are eight through 10
and are not attached to the sternum but to
[SPEAKER_00]: the coastal cartilage of the seventh rib
above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the floating ribs, the last two 11
and 12 are only attached to the vertebrae
[SPEAKER_00]: and no direct attachment even with
cartilage to the sternum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the pelvis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the area of attachment of the
upper leg bones and contains portions of
[SPEAKER_00]: the vertebral column, those fused portions
down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see this is definitely an
irregular bone, one of the strongest bones
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is the main point of attachment
and a lot of the weight and pressure is
[SPEAKER_00]: exerted in this area of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to our leg bones and we have
the femur here, the large one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a thigh bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the longest bone and is considered to
be the strongest bone in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the patella which is known as
the kneecap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a flat circular triangular bone that
protects the knee joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the fibula which is a long thin
and lateral bone of the lower leg and is
[SPEAKER_00]: parallel to the tibia and helps stabilize
the ankle and support the muscles of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lower leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the tibia here known as the
shin bone and is the second largest bone
[SPEAKER_00]: in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people confuse the tibia and the
fibula.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tibia you can think as thicker here
because it is a thicker of the two bones
[SPEAKER_00]: in the lower leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the arm now we have the humerus
and we have the radius and the ulna here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see initially kind of a similar
structure that we saw in the leg but of
[SPEAKER_00]: course smaller bones overall and the
radius and ulna allows a rotation to occur
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into the hands and the hand is
located at the distal end of each arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the end and we can see we have our
carpals which are kind of the wrist bones
[SPEAKER_00]: there, the metacarpals and then the
phalanges that we have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there would be an interior and a
posterior view when we're looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation of how those would be presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly we have the feet and this is
the terminal portion of the limb which
[SPEAKER_00]: bears the weight and allows locomotion or
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be important for footprints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the foot here in the bone
structure we see very similar to the
[SPEAKER_00]: hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be mindful of that that there are a lot
of similarities between the upper limbs
[SPEAKER_00]: and lower limbs and being able to provide
a distinction of those can be important
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're looking to identify bones of
the body.
