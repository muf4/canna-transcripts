[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at plant leaves here,
something we all might take for granted,
[SPEAKER_00]: we kind of assume, oh yeah, plants have
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this lecture will try to give
you a little bit more of an appreciation
[SPEAKER_00]: for some of the complexities and
differences within leaf structures of
[SPEAKER_00]: different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the basic, leaves are
like living solar panels, and the goal is
[SPEAKER_00]: to collect the sun's energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our solar panels are all through the
field here, so the leaves, their goal is
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of collect and absorb as much of
that sun energy as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that the plant can efficiently carry
out the conversion of this light energy to
[SPEAKER_00]: sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting in general, leaves are usually
the most predominant shoot organ and are
[SPEAKER_00]: structurally diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see just a couple examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growth occurs by means of marginal
meristems, and the marginal meristems grow
[SPEAKER_00]: outward and ultimately form the blade
portion, which is the flattened portion of
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once the leaf is fully expanded,
the marginal meristems cease to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once they reach maturity, those leaves
will no longer grow, only in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: stages will leaves grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as leaves are growing, as an important
note, while we think of leaves always
[SPEAKER_00]: producing energy, when a leaf is very
small, when it's first expanding,
[SPEAKER_00]: it may actually be a sink, it may actually
consume more energy than it provides.
[SPEAKER_00]: At maturity though, leaves will definitely
produce more than they ever took
[SPEAKER_00]: initially, but sometimes they get going,
that small leaf might be more of a sink
[SPEAKER_00]: than a source until it gets fully mature
and reaches maximum efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at a cross section of leaf,
so what is a leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to provide some nice examples here
and try to relate kind of the cartoon
[SPEAKER_00]: image to what a real microscopic image may
look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember our cuticle, located at the
top here, this arrow will indicate right
[SPEAKER_00]: here at the top is where the cuticle is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The palisade parenchyma, this region right
here, this is the upper portion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf and this is important for absorption
of a lot of sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spongy parenchyma here, it's spongy
because it needs to allow for gas exchange
[SPEAKER_00]: and for water exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you look here, our stomata,
allowing for the influx of CO2 and the
[SPEAKER_00]: release of oxygen protected by our guard
cells, well that's located right in this
[SPEAKER_00]: region here is where the stomata would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our mesophyll, which is this entire
area between the upper and lower
[SPEAKER_00]: epidermis, this red region right here,
this would be the mesophyll section.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very high quality image and
hopefully this kind of cartoon and
[SPEAKER_00]: well-defined image here can help you
interrelate so when you look at the real
[SPEAKER_00]: image, you're able to recognize these
certain regions on the leaf cross-section.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking more in a macroscopic,
something you might be a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with are the leaf parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The node is where it attaches to the
steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The node would be down in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: The petiole here is the leaf stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blade contains the network of veins
and vascular bundles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the margin is the very edge here of
the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the midrib in this case is very strong
in this and the tip would be the very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I typically point out the
margin is that it's important potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: for identification purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we may do a lab where you're kind of
investigating different leaf structures
[SPEAKER_00]: and the margin is one thing you can use
for identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dicot and monocot leaves do differ.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have some examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A is a monocot and this has leaves with
parallel vanation, meaning all the veins
[SPEAKER_00]: are run parallel to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast with pinnate vanation,
when this is where a leaf has a main
[SPEAKER_00]: midrib, it is distinguished as a dicot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a strong midrib here and then we
have the network that branches off from
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the real world example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that strong midrib and we have a
branching from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A ginkgo below is a plant that has what we
call palmate vanation, kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: spreads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of like the palm of your hand kind
of spreading out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's indicated by these leaves here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, a ginkgo is a gymnosperm in the
same classification of conifers,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as pine trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just one example of palmate
vanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pinnate vanation and this is
parallel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves can also be expressed in different
types of simple or compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are a variety of forms that
exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple leaves are a single undivided
blade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you hear this banana tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, simple leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into compound leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a blade divided into leaflets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see here, palmate leaf
compound and compound leafs, that leaf is
[SPEAKER_00]: divided and they're divided in a palmate
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have pinnate leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that strong midrib here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have double compound leaves,
example here, where, yes, this is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like a leaflet within a leaflet here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these also can be helpful in use for
identification of certain leaves for
[SPEAKER_00]: certain species of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: To kind of give you just kind of a quick,
general cartoon image, pinnate leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: compound describe leaflets that are
arranged in pairs along the central axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And palmately compound describe leaflets
that radiate out from a common point at
[SPEAKER_00]: the blade end of the petiole.
[SPEAKER_00]: See some examples here, pinnately vanated,
pinnately lobed, and pinnately compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: The compound has those distinctive little
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lobed, we see these definitely lobed
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same thing here for the palmately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Palmately lobed, we see some lobes
developing and a palmately compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's almost individual, what looks
like individual leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how they're organized on the stem is
another key factor and something that you
[SPEAKER_00]: may not notice a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you start looking at it,
it can be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal is to maximize sunlight
exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why leaves are arranged in
different patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alternate is when leaves spiral around a
shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here alternate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see one going here down, one going up,
one going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up, they're alternating their pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like left, right, left,
right, left, right is alternate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opposite occurs in the opposite side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our shoot, and we have them
going in opposite directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One to the left, one to the right,
originating kind of at that same central
[SPEAKER_00]: node.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that again represented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have whorled, which is kind of
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are leaves that circle around the
stem as a group.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are whorled appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the whorl, whorl, and the whorl
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are three different types of leaf
arrangements and patterns that they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on with that parallel palmately
and pinnately, good three examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to parallel that palmately,
kind of like the palm of your hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: and pinnately has that strong midrib.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these veins that we're seeing
different arrangements of are composed of
[SPEAKER_00]: both xylem and phloem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at shade leaves, may initially
appear similar between these two,
[SPEAKER_00]: but are specialized for their own
particular microenvironment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be larger, thinner,
less mesophyll layers, and fewer
[SPEAKER_00]: chloroplasts for the shade leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here the leaves in direct sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have that much darker region,
are able to absorb a lot more sun,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they pack in this top region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our shade leaves are a little thinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't contain quite as many
chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're simply not able or exposed to as
much sunlight if they don't build up the
[SPEAKER_00]: reserves like these ones in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones in the sun, higher
photosynthesis rate, better exchange with
[SPEAKER_00]: water, carbon dioxide and oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we see a little bit more
complexity and a little thicker here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones exposed to sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our arid regions, just to go back for one
moment here, where it says it tends to be
[SPEAKER_00]: larger, that's not thicker, that's larger
in area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of like wider when we say
larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that in leaves that might
be shaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a tree or like a tomato plant
too, the shaded leaves tend to be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit larger or wider in that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arid region leaves, they have many
modifications to handle these
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have succulent water retaining
leaves, like this aloe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thick leathery leaves, if you ever touched
an aloe plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fewer and or protected stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here is our stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still have stomata, but they're
recessed into the leaf a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not located right at the surface
of the underside here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're recessed a little bit more,
protecting them, eliminating water from
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving as easily, creating a little bit
more of an environment that can handle
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the more arid regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aquatic environment leaves, this is kind
of an interesting note.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stomata will be present in higher
numbers in the leaf's upper surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these lily pads, because they're
floating in water, if they had the stomata
[SPEAKER_00]: on the underside, they wouldn't be able to
breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a higher percentage of stomata
on the upper side of the leaves as we see
[SPEAKER_00]: here, which is not characteristic of most
of the other plants that we've seen for
[SPEAKER_00]: gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want it to be protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in this case, in the underside is
submerged in water, so therefore we down
[SPEAKER_00]: them on the upper side so they can more
efficiently exchange gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other specialized leaves here are called
tendrils.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you looked closely at our pea plants,
they have these little tendrils that will
[SPEAKER_00]: grab onto the cages that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grapes are another example in squash
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps support the stems as they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: These technically, while they look like
little curly cues, they're technically
[SPEAKER_00]: modified leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other leaves are insect trapping leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are very specialized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our pitcher plant, they look like little
pitchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flies will fall in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get trapped and then slowly get
digested.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tend to be plants, in all three of
these cases, where nitrogen is very low
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're basically breaking down
the flies as a nitrogen source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunny dews, they look like these little
kind of little water droplets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these are extremely sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a fly or bug was to land on these,
they'd be stuck here and then the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: can consume them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The obvious one, the Venus fly trap,
when the fly flies in, it tingles these
[SPEAKER_00]: little fibers and then these close up and
they will eventually consume the fly again
[SPEAKER_00]: to get some of the proteins and nitrogen
from those flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just some general ways to help organize or
identify certain plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to be responsible for all
of these different types, but when we do
[SPEAKER_00]: identification of certain leaves,
these slides might be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to pause them and try to
compare what leaf sample you may have and
[SPEAKER_00]: how it relates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about a couple of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: A palmit leaf would be one example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's many different shapes
and arrangements to leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we talked about that margin being
very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different types of margins that
we can look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are different classifications that
we have to help identify certain leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the venation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about some of the similar ones,
the parallel, the palmit leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pinnately, but there's even more than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, very important for identification
purposes and kept on these nice large
[SPEAKER_00]: slides to help you be able to cross
compare if you're trying to identify a
single leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting it all together, these are all the
different types here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I highlight each on its own
individual slide.
