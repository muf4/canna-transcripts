[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here I'm going to talk about
ceramic metal halide lights, CMH grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see two pictured right here,
and just a little bit of describing them
[SPEAKER_00]: and what they're typically used for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ceramic metal halides, they come in two
wattages, 315, which would be a single
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb, and a 630 watt, which would
basically be two 315 watt in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are ceramic arc tube, which is
stronger and degrades slower despite
[SPEAKER_00]: operating at greater pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typical HID lights use quartz,
which is weaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this ceramic metal halide is much
improved over even a high-pressure sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: or a regular metal halide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're beneficial for the vegetative
growth process, and they offer a broad
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum, a nice white light that's
efficient compared to other high-intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: discharge lights, and they also have bulbs
that will last longer than your typical
[SPEAKER_00]: HID lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to all these reasons and then some,
ceramic metal halides are gaining
[SPEAKER_00]: popularity amongst growers, and you can
kind of see why with all the benefits that
[SPEAKER_00]: they do offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, they run cooler, and they
offer many benefits over fluorescents or
[SPEAKER_00]: T5 lights that are considered to be their
new replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of buying a bunch of long kind
of fluorescent tubes, buying one ceramic
[SPEAKER_00]: metal halide can suffice that and just
make it a lot easier to keep track of and
[SPEAKER_00]: overall be cheaper to run in the long
term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ceramic metal halides produce greater
output, and a grower only needs to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: worry about one bulb and it's a long life
compared to fluorescents.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a small propagation tent that I
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a two by two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see I have a ceramic metal halide
inserted here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Below here I have an easy clone,
and there's my monitor there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, instead of trying to change out all
the T5 lights or worry about them to fit
[SPEAKER_00]: in this small area, I simply can take this
one fixture and be good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also dimmable, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Philips Master Color is considered to
be the standard bulb for this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: light, and it really is kind of the
industry standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though you will pay more for it,
you do get what you pay for in this
[SPEAKER_00]: instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ceramic metal halides are well favored
for the vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also be used in combination with
high pressure sodium stirring and
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering to help increase the spectrum
the plants are exposed to, and it does
[SPEAKER_00]: emit some UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see here's a ceramic metal
halide, and here's a high pressure sodium,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're kind of intermixed down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we see definitely the yellowing and
the overpowering of the high pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: sodiums, but having an increased spectrum
can help improve the quality and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids that the plants may produce
in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages to ceramic metal halides
are they have low wattage consumption,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I said, 315 or 630 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They reduced heat generation, great for
early stages of plant growth, and their
[SPEAKER_00]: full spectrum white light that they
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the downfall is they often need
to be supplemented with high pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium during flowering phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example here is the Dymalux,
which ships with the bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have to install it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dimmable, as we can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can rotate down and change the
wattages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It runs very cool and efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's low profile, and as a result,
can be used in place of T5 fluorescence,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also used during the vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reflector is about 98% efficient,
so there's a lot of advantages with
[SPEAKER_00]: ceramic metal halides in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, this Dymalux is a great
example of a lot of the benefits that
[SPEAKER_00]: ceramic metal halides offer in maximizing
those benefits with that low profile and
[SPEAKER_00]: dimmable qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
