[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at populations in
general, but on the title slide here we
[SPEAKER_00]: have the world population percentages.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that China has the largest
percentage here based on 2017 statistics,
[SPEAKER_00]: 18.5% of the world's population.
[SPEAKER_00]: India is not far behind at 17.9%,
the United States at 4.3%, Indonesia 3.5%,
[SPEAKER_00]: and continuing down from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And smaller ones here, the others that are
not listed, just kind of lumped into this
[SPEAKER_00]: category.
[SPEAKER_00]: They represent almost 30% of the world's
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So population summary slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just included here as kind of a
way to review at the end to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you've touched on all these points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you understand population size,
population density, population dispersion,
[SPEAKER_00]: and population growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This video lecture will address many of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a couple other video lectures
that will tie these in to allow you to
[SPEAKER_00]: make worthwhile connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So population range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in general, it's a geographic area
within which that species can be found
[SPEAKER_00]: with localized dispersion densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to use the example here of
fire ants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were accidentally introduced to
the United States in the 1930s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were actually stowed on ship
ballasts that were landed in a port of
[SPEAKER_00]: Mobile, Alabama here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put star right here where Mobile,
Alabama is located.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be familiar with where this is
located, sadly, during hurricane season.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very common area there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently infest about two hundred and
fifty million acres in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: these fire ants, because they're adapting
to drier conditions in western areas and
[SPEAKER_00]: infesting greater regional areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their population range is increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contributing to the spread of fire ants is
mating flights within the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also flooding regions pushing them
in different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hitchhiking on vehicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agricultural commodities and horticultural
commodities are helping ship them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, they throw out large regions of the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are areas in red where it's certain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green represents very possible conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the blue regions are less likely,
but still possible areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see that they definitely like the
warmer environments, but they are
[SPEAKER_00]: expanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another organism, sadly, that's expanding
is zebra mussels.
[SPEAKER_00]: The native distribution of these species
is in the Black Sea in Caspary,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Black Sea in Eurasia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And zebra mussels have become invasive
species in North America, Great Britain,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ireland, Italy, Spain, and Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over a very large area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they look like kind of close up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sadly, one's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we could see that they very rarely
will just find one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can really colonize an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, they can disrupt ecosystems
by basically causing like a monotypic,
[SPEAKER_00]: a single species here colonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can damage harbors, waterways,
ships, boats, water treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and power plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here how they just kind of encrust
this kind of buoy that was sitting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zebra mussels, water treatment plants,
are most impacted because water intakes
[SPEAKER_00]: bring in microscopic free swimming larvae
directly into the facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zebra mussels can clog pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of their massive growth rate,
it just kind of multiplies so densely that
[SPEAKER_00]: water can't pass through.
[SPEAKER_00]: This image here shows a shopping cart that
was left in zebra mussel infected waters
[SPEAKER_00]: for a few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mussels have colonized every
available surface on the cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here they are colonizing other shells.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just see how they simply just take
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, zebra mussel range,
they're still spreading at an alarming
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here 1988 and expanding from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sponsored by the USGS.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see how they take over river systems,
how they're expanding in more densely
[SPEAKER_00]: areas here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far the West Coast, the West Coast is
pretty free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down the Mississippi River here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And slowly expanding further and further
west.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sadly, while they're really dense
here, they do start to pop up on the West
[SPEAKER_00]: Coast even in points in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are still spreading at an
alarming rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an area of concern here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much of a concern, a local problem here
in Connecticut will be areas where they
[SPEAKER_00]: indicate high risk lakes and water
systems, medium risk and low risk areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a list of areas where they're
currently known to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, they'll hang signs up to help
educate boaters and people in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not transporting these.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be transported in water that's
taken from an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be transported in live wells of
boats, in bunks of trailers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all things that people need to
be mindful that they're disposing all
[SPEAKER_00]: foreign matter far away from the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Population expansions, a pyramid of
numbers of a biological population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Population growth in more and less
developed countries based in 2002
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less developed countries are having a much
larger population expansion than more
[SPEAKER_00]: developed countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at, this is kind of
what's already been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at predictions going into
the future when we see this trend
[SPEAKER_00]: continuing based on the population
pyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Population contraction, it's a reduction
over time of a region's population.
[SPEAKER_00]: The decline can be caused by several
factors, including basically under par
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility, along with limited immigration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavy emigration is exiting a country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a disease that comes in,
famine or war.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of the Cod, we see that there
was in the 60s, kind of mid 60s,
[SPEAKER_00]: 70s, explosion in the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then sadly, in 1992, the population
completely crashed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is true in East Coast of
Newfoundland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also occurring sadly in other areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cape Cod in Massachusetts has sometimes
been called Cape No Cod because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: missing of the Cod population there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a result of population contraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the region's population is on the
decline, which can be for a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the population is on the decline.
