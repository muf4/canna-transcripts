[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding the reproductive strategy
of plants is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to look at a couple different
ways and see how they relate to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: in particular, and what makes that plant
unique or different than some other plant
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two main types of reproductive
strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's monaceous, which are male and
female reproductive organs produced on the
[SPEAKER_00]: same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is common in oak trees, corn,
and squash plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's dioecious, where a plant only
produces male or female reproductive
[SPEAKER_00]: organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is found in ginkgoes,
asparagus, and also cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless of the reproductive strategy,
the end goal is to produce viable seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the monaceous, or
hermaphrodites is sometimes referred to,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are plants with both male and female
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This limits the travel distance for pollen
and can help allow for a few individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: to populate an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this monaceous, we see a male flower
and a female flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the male flower here, produces the
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the female flower that's
producing, in this case, the small pumpkin
[SPEAKER_00]: that will grow and mature and have the
seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dioecious plants, though, this
reproductive strategy requires transfer of
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen from one individual to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant will only produce male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a female plant and will only
produce female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, the genetic variability will
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we had a separate plant producing
pollen and a separate plant producing
[SPEAKER_00]: female portions, it would need to transfer
that pollen over, which can help increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetic variability for this
particular species.
[SPEAKER_00]: A dioecious plant, for example,
cannabis, produces male or female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not and, it's or female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male plants only produce pollen and
the female plants only produce buds or
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds upon successful pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do cannabis seeds come from,
or hemp seeds come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds are a result of a successful
pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the pollination is pollen
fertilizing an ovum or an egg that will
[SPEAKER_00]: result in a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The production of seeds requires the plant
to develop most of its energy into the
[SPEAKER_00]: next generation, and seeds require energy
storage, protective seed coat,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a whole bunch of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how does seedless cannabis produce?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is this possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, kind of no major secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole goal is to grow a female plant
and simply do not allow pollen to come in
[SPEAKER_00]: contact with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like to be growing a flower here and
not allowing a bee, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: to come in contact with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a research plot here,
and we see the bags over all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: flower structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be eliminating pollen transfer
or allowing specific crosses to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how is seedless cannabis produced?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's quite simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just prevent pollen from coming in
contact with the female flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why most growers are only
growing females and males are discarded is
[SPEAKER_00]: males will not yield buds that will
produce much in the way of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So value of male plants in bud production
is basically zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing males is more important for
breeders, but not for people looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Male plants should be identified early and
discarded since they do not yield much,
[SPEAKER_00]: and their pollen could jeopardize female
plants from producing quality buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality buds, in having a plant produce
higher cannabinoids, if it's producing
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, its cannabinoid production will
suffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only value for males is for breeders
for their pollen to create viable seeds to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce genetic variation or grow more
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for most people, males are simply
discarded as soon as they can be
[SPEAKER_00]: identified because their quality or
cannabinoid production is quite poor in
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison to female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
