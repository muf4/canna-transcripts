[SPEAKER_00]: So in this video, we're going to relate
genetic engineering to plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically grown in a lab, controlled
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see growth chambers here, little
sterile conditions in these little jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to relate this,
how we're able to change genes related to
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another one on medicine, we look at
vaccines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here looking at food we may eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So transgenic plants, such as corn,
cotton, soybeans, and many others,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different ways we can genetically modify
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One example here, and I'd provide the
source, where we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: roundup-ready soybean yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So roundup-ready means these soybeans are
resistant to the herbicide roundup that
[SPEAKER_00]: you might be familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the control, and here's the
treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yield in bushels per acre is your
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, yield is referring to how many
soybeans you're getting off the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're noticing it dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So improved yield on roundup-ready
soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 4.3 bushel average increase per acre,
average of 14 treatment locations across
[SPEAKER_00]: different states and into Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quart per acre of this roundup,
which is the active ingredient glyphosate,
[SPEAKER_00]: is what's roundup is basically what that
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by having soybeans that aren't
affected by roundup, glyphosate being the
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicide, farmers are able to go through
and spray the field, control the weeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and not kill their crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's causing the increase in
yield here seen in 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: So conventional compared to genetically
modified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, conventional corn, you can find the
link down here, no real benefits detected
[SPEAKER_00]: versus genetically modified corn,
requires 6% less pesticides, produce
[SPEAKER_00]: enough calories to feed 88 million people
per year, higher yield, 7.6% in this
[SPEAKER_00]: study, increased farmer income,
overall across all farmers from 1996 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 2007, estimated over $44 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could see here there's some
advantages and pressures to switch over to
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically modified corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are potential risks with
genetically modified, here abbreviated GM.
[SPEAKER_00]: The promise of genetic engineering is very
much evident.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's generated some considerable
controversy and protest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are genetic engineers playing God by
attempting to mess with the genes?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been rallies that say no GMOs very
much against genetically modified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you're for or against it,
corn production and yield per acre has
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatically increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to feed the world here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the pressures too to this
increasing of yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And GM crops are one way that's showing to
continue this increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a golden rice example, this is another
form of genetically modified.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a variety of rice that was
genetically engineered to produce beta
[SPEAKER_00]: carotene, which is a precursor to vitamin
A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Areas of the world where there's a
shortage of vitamin A in the diet,
[SPEAKER_00]: this genetically modified rice has this
kind of golden-like color to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great plant because it's widespread
use over the world as a main food crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of growing this traditional
rice by simply growing this golden rice,
[SPEAKER_00]: behaves in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Individuals are able to get this precursor
to vitamin A as beta carotene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can really save a lot of people,
a lot of lives without really causing any
[SPEAKER_00]: change, just simply starting with
different seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two common traits though for genetically
modified, at least used on the large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: here across the United States,
are herbicide resistance is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's often referred to as Roundup
Ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Roundup Ready corn, soybeans,
alfalfa, canola oil, cotton, it simply
[SPEAKER_00]: means that Roundup, when applied to most
plants, causes them to die as an
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, these genetically modified plants
have this protein that's able to basically
[SPEAKER_00]: break down and not suffer the effects of
Roundup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genetically modified plants are
resistant to this weed killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this allows to occur is the plant
that has that particular gene to survive,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of the regular crops and weeds and
any other plants in the vicinity of that
[SPEAKER_00]: chosen crop dies, allowing the main crop
to be able to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the advantage to this, and farmers
don't have to plow the fields,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just takes a lot of input, a lot of
diesel, a lot of energy, a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dust bowl elimination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the turn of the century,
this is actual images of topsoil that got
[SPEAKER_00]: picked up by the wind and carried these
large clouds of dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It occurred because farmers plowed their
fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: They plowed their fields to reduce the
weed pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with herbicide resistance,
they don't have to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, improving yields and
resulting in cleaner fields because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of weeds without going through the
plowing and have a risk of losing very
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable topsoil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some disadvantages, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herbicide resistance, like anything,
you use any chemical for over a period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants, animals are going to develop
resistance to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be as effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because only certain crops are
resistant to that herbicide, the concept
[SPEAKER_00]: of monocropping occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only grow or only that one
particular crop, but that one particular
[SPEAKER_00]: gene is going to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, you're going to have a bunch
of essentially potentially clones or at
[SPEAKER_00]: least ones that are very genetically
similar grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't grow carrots and peas and
soybeans in the same field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only grow genetically modified
ones that are resistant to the herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of superweeds, I move myself over
to this side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Superweeds, where we're applying these
herbicides and the whole resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: develops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you grab another herbicide,
different chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it'll be resistant to that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apply another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apply another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: These superweeds may become resistant
eventually to all of the herbicides that
[SPEAKER_00]: we currently have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another concern, potential
disadvantage that could occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another modification that's being added to
plants is insect resistance, BT.
[SPEAKER_00]: BT inside is what it's called,
bacillus thuringiensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this does is it breaks down and kills
caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a protein produced by cell bacteria
and harmful to pests such as caterpillars,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been introduced into tomato plants
and many others, corns is another example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see feeding that's occurring on a
plant that did not have the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a genetically modified one and we
see very minimal feeding that has
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Popular traits for herbicide resistance is
one, as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insect resistance is another and putting
them both together in the same plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: another one that's getting popularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herbicide tolerance we see increasing
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insect resistance also, but now we're
seeing the rise of the combination of the
[SPEAKER_00]: two, putting two traits into one.
[SPEAKER_00]: These concerns for risks with these GM
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are GM foods safe for the environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will other organisms be harmed
unintentionally?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will pests become resistant to these
pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if the introduced genes are passed
from the GM crop to wild or weedy
[SPEAKER_00]: relatives?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all concerns with these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other issues is that we have
this ever-increasing world population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to produce more food if we have
a way of modifying crops to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: meet that demand that will allow the
population to increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also potential for other risks
that may be occurring with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starvation with the other flip side of
that coin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So insect resistance, again, at bacillus
thern ingensis, at BT.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advantages to this are that you don't have
to apply insecticides to the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one wants to buy a corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the tip basically eaten out by an
insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduces trips in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers don't have to drive over all these
fields and these are very large fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, early insects can be easily
controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first flush of insects can be
controlled because the crop already has a
[SPEAKER_00]: built-in insecticide with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the cons are IPM, it's integrated
pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is managing the pest effectively year
to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're just putting a pesticide in the
field, in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really kind of going against the
whole IPM practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insecticide resistance, we can get insects
that could be resistant and non-target
[SPEAKER_00]: insects could also be affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's resistance to different chemistry
of insecticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the resistance increasing much as
we saw with the herbicide resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here we have ideally, if the entire
field was applied and grown as with those
[SPEAKER_00]: insect resistant genes, we notice the
increase of developing or selecting for
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals that are resistant becomes
very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: What farmers should be doing is allocating
part of the field that simply does not
[SPEAKER_00]: have GM crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that does is that keeps some insects
alive that are susceptible to that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular herbicide or that particular,
in this case, insecticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: That allows us to be mixed in the
population and increases the odds that
[SPEAKER_00]: there'll be susceptible genes in the
environment through our punnet square
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses, reducing the overall pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hard part is if farmers grow large
scale, we're killing the vast majority
[SPEAKER_00]: off, we can be selecting for this increase
in insecticide resistance at a faster
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-target insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corn borer is killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the ones that go into the very
tips of the corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the pollen that washes into streams
may kill the non-target caddis fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The caddis fly looks like it's present in
freshwater streams, eaten by a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: trout and fish and aquatic organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be a potential non-target
insect from the pollen from the Bt corn
[SPEAKER_00]: that's targeted at corn borer could be
getting into streams.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be potentially harming the caddis
fly population, a non-target insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potential risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are GM foods safe to eat?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a common question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, herbicide blocks the synthesis of
aromatic amino acids, which is okay
[SPEAKER_00]: because humans don't make any aromatic
amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So glyphosate is not harmful to humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, gene modifications that render
the plant resistant to glyphosate may
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce a novel approach to GM foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: If GM foods are safe to eat, they may have
the chance to cause allergies in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put some examples here of some of the
aromatic amino acids, their full name,
[SPEAKER_00]: their three letter abbreviation,
and also their single letter abbreviation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tryptophan are probably most familiar
with, especially around Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: TRP or W are the abbreviations for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should GM foods be labeled?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every serious scientific investigation has
included that GM foods are safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no real health risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, well, why label
something that's that harmful?
[SPEAKER_00]: However, people basically have the right
to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are seeing increase in labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: More laws are being passed at the state
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are seeing an increase in labeling
of GM crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO acreage, GMF organism acreage
worldwide, we see overall vastly
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just from 1996 to 2009, even from 2009,
we're seeing a continuation of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not familiar with the company
Monsanto, they are leading and pioneering
[SPEAKER_00]: this roundup resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They developed and make a roundup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are working on increasing
genetically modified food.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you their websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're advocating is that by getting
everyone involved in form, we can prepare
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow enough food for a growing world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one that's predicted to be 9
billion people by 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're playing the side where we need
to produce more food, which is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they see genetically modified corn in
other crops as a way to supplement that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, people have this stigma against the
genetically modified crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's no scientific studies that
show there's any major negative effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the real question is we just simply
don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have enough years of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we start growing all genetically
modified crops and there's a problem that
[SPEAKER_00]: develops down the road, and that's all
we're growing, that can lead to potential
[SPEAKER_00]: issues also.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to keep in mind we have this
delicate balance of this ever-increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: world population.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main question is how are we going to
feed all these individuals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
