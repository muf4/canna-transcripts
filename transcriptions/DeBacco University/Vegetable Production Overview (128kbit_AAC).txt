[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm gonna give the vegetable
production overview, which will hold true
[SPEAKER_00]: for just about any vegetable crops you're
looking to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, the goal is to produce high
quality vegetables efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Planning is important to help ensure
success of the farm, of the crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: and of the vitality of the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with what is farming?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm often asked this, and I think this is
a pretty good idea of what farmers have to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with, and something most people can
relate to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the game of Tetris.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's always new challenges coming
down, and we're trying to find a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: fit them and make them work for our given
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're rewarded then when we get a line
here, and we're constantly trying to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: this as low as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though it seems like problems
will keep mounting higher and higher,
[SPEAKER_00]: we try to find a way to make the puzzle
pieces fit together and keep moving on
[SPEAKER_00]: because we know there's gonna be another
challenge coming right behind the one we
[SPEAKER_00]: just dealt with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we deal with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the key part is organization and
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organization and efficiency aren't very
important on all walks of life,
[SPEAKER_00]: but especially with farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will admit this is not my tool wall here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of a highly organized
one, and it makes it very efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Standardizing what you do is in your
favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to standardize what you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this refers to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's certain things that's out of
your control, but certain other things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you are able to control, you want to
go through and do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speed, quality, increase, you want to
decrease the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, if you've got to grab a certain size
wrench, you know right where to go and get
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, the rows are the same size,
the same width.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the same hoops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not trying to figure out what hoops
go with what row and what field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes it a lot more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The standardization of your work makes it
a lot easier overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the key part, if you do get it in this
organized fashion, you want to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: return those tools into the same area so
you can maintain that efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it to look like this one
month and the next month, all these tools
[SPEAKER_00]: being on a scrap bench over on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So time is money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you need to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have pretty evident there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say you can get more money from
the bank, but I still have not found out a
[SPEAKER_00]: way how to get more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you always have to factor in your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know the sun up, the sun down,
and then some is kind of the working
[SPEAKER_00]: hours, but you've got to factor in your
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just can't be burning yourself out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain things that you can make more
efficient, and it may cost a little money
[SPEAKER_00]: initially, but it will save you time in
the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And planning is one of those steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important to plan,
have a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also try to be prepared for expected
or common issues, but still be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust the changes on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be able to observe your
crop and kind of take a look at it and
[SPEAKER_00]: document.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about planning, what you see,
what changes that are occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to plan for issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see good weed control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see stakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see everything pruned right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see everything trimmed and organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like a quarterback, we still want to
be able to come to the line if we see a
[SPEAKER_00]: defense we didn't expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have an observation that we didn't
initially plan for, we won't want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to make changes preventatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a key aspect of farming and
keeping an idea of a plan, but being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to have it not be completely rigid and
adjust to the conditions you're seeing on
[SPEAKER_00]: a particular year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, vegetables don't get cheap on
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is a couple cents less.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's a dollar less per pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always feel you need to buy the highest
quality seeds you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have good germination rates
typically, and they could have disease
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance or sometimes multiple disease
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can really help you in season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to save a couple dollars here and
there on seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could really hurt you in the long run
if a disease does come through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have a buffer factor, I always say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just buy the amount of seeds that
you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have a little bit extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: In case you have poor germination rate,
in case you have something go wrong,
[SPEAKER_00]: in case you have a flat that falls over,
you want to have a couple extras just in
[SPEAKER_00]: case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind what seeds you are buying
in case you do have success so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: order those again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though seed companies are pretty good
about remembering what you ordered,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's always a good idea just to know for
yourself the exact variety that you
[SPEAKER_00]: bought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Season of change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the winter or general off-season to
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hard to plan in the heat of
summer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that winter, that off-season time when
snow is on the ground and everything's
[SPEAKER_00]: frozen up to kind of make your plan then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the growing season, you're
basically following your plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have a plan, follow the plan,
and you'll be surprised how successful you
[SPEAKER_00]: can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't have a plan and that's
why it's easy to beat most folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking this off-season, this downtime,
where there's not as much going on as say
[SPEAKER_00]: in the heat of August or July to develop
that plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: What worked, what didn't work,
what I want to do, what do you think I can
[SPEAKER_00]: do well, take this time to plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your time is valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to factor in the time that you
spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you may not want to track the hours
that you spend per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, the greatest gift you can
give someone is your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you give your time,
you're giving a portion of your life that
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll never get back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know it can kind of have this
downward spiral here where it seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: there's just not enough time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be sure to factor in your time so that
you don't get burnt out in season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it gets tiring at the end anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind what you're spending your
time on and if there's a way to do it more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently so you're not, quote,
wasting your time.
