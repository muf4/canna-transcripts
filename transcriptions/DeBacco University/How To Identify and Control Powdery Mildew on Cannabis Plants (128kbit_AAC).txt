[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over how to identify and
[SPEAKER_00]: control powdery mildew as we see exhibited
in this picture right here in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over how to identify
and control powdery mildew on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting it to this stage,
probably a little late, so hopefully you
[SPEAKER_00]: can identify it earlier than this and
implement some of the suggested controls
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't get to this level of
severity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we go about identifying powdery
mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a white powdery substance that
is typically first noticed on the leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: but can infect the buds as well as
sometimes even the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp powdery mildew is caused by what
looks like now is two potential fungi and
[SPEAKER_00]: is identified by its upright chains and
barrel-shaped spores when you're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: zoom in at high magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can tend to favor one side,
either the top or the bottom of the leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: during early establishment, so be sure to
scout both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I find it much more on the upper
surfaces of the leaves and the
[SPEAKER_00]: undersurface is left untouched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times in other plants, sometimes it
starts on the underside first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, be sure to check both sides of
the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also check shadier locations, typically
the interior portions of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: those leaves, as this is where it
typically is first to show up and may go
[SPEAKER_00]: unnoticed because it's a little bit harder
to go through and scout those particular
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what is the life cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's important to understand the
life cycle of any sort of disease in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense where can you potentially break that
life cycle to reduce the pressure on your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what's happening is powdery
mildew is these little canidium,
[SPEAKER_00]: these canidophores are breaking apart like
little chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They float in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going through, they're landing on
leaves or bud surfaces and they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: through germinating, getting their
self-established, getting themselves to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow again, producing more spores that are
then being released and kind of spreading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in most situations, powdery mildew
does not winter over, produce a sexual
[SPEAKER_00]: phase within the northern regions of the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in indoor grows, that might be
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for some outdoor species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The frost, the cold weather might break
the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes if you're growing indoors,
particularly greenhouse environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may be able to get that perpetual kind
of powdery mildew pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're growing near a greenhouse,
that powdery mildew could be living in
[SPEAKER_00]: that greenhouse overwintering,
making it an earlier chance to get powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew than you would normally expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that mycelium network that does occur,
here it's stained for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: One can see the mycelium network of
powdery mildew inside the leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if powdery mildew is not visible to
the human eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: DPI is days post-inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: HPI is the hours past inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're noticing is this DPI,
HPI, zero hours post-inoculation to five
[SPEAKER_00]: hours, one day, three day, we're seeing
that it lands on this leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: It then spreads horizontally and then
it'll set down like a little foot into the
[SPEAKER_00]: epidermis of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll grab nutrients from the plant and
then it'll start to grow sideways and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll start to grow upwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those portions, mycelium will break off
and then they'll go through and infect
[SPEAKER_00]: other parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's called powdery because it is a
powdery look to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's able to spread very quickly in that
regards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here days post-inoculation zero
to one to two to three to four to five to
[SPEAKER_00]: six.
[SPEAKER_00]: How quick that mycelium can go through and
spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be mindful of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the environmental, how does the
environment impact powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, temperature, moderate temperatures
are required for infection and disease
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Optimum temperatures for that conical
production is 65 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the little kind of like
spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think about them that go through
and spread the powdery.
[SPEAKER_00]: 86 plus degrees Fahrenheit and greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Infection and spore production are reduced
by half.
[SPEAKER_00]: 55 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit disease
development can be delayed by one or two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just shows how the outdoor
environment, particularly we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation over temperature, can really
impact things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture is required for the pathogen to
infect and develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: High humidity provides sufficient moisture
so air exchange around plants is advised,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially for indoor and greenhouse
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: For outdoor locations, shady air areas in
a field will likely have increased powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at hemp, particularly
growing outdoors where there is less
[SPEAKER_00]: control over the environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may influence the variety you select.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some varieties are minimally susceptible,
some extremely susceptible to powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see just a couple listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at considering any of
those varieties, what their usage might be
[SPEAKER_00]: for CBD, for grain, for fiber,
and their susceptibility to powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to see some of these studies because
it may influence what variety you choose
[SPEAKER_00]: to go with because it will depend on the
pressure you're suffering for powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's also looking at another study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Primary data detached here of leaf assays
shows some differences in susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: These studies are continuing and we're
screening for additional 37 cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a study done in Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 high CBD cultivars were screened for
resistance to powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disease severity, we can see some much
higher in disease severity, some much less
[SPEAKER_00]: on disease severity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, some of these names might be
worth consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the management of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So forget powdery mildew, the goal is to
initially reduce the favorable
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continual scouting is also important to
catch potential problems early as they can
[SPEAKER_00]: spread very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may influence plant spacing for
outdoor locations, as well as the pruning
[SPEAKER_00]: method if you're an indoor grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're wondering exactly how to
manage powdery, what products you should
[SPEAKER_00]: be considering, these are some suggested
spray products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in both situations, you need to know
your local and current regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as a starting point for indoor
growers, in grow rooms, daily sulfur
[SPEAKER_00]: burning can help reduce the likelihood of
seeing powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are supplementing with carbon
dioxide and have sensors, they likely will
[SPEAKER_00]: void their warranty and will become
ineffective if you have sulfur in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, more contact products that have low
residuals are recommended, such as
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen dioxide or hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40% milk, 60% water can actually help
suppress spreading of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfur, as I mentioned, but it can burn
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neem oil can also burn the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mill stop is a potassium bicarb,
typically not as effective as the milk and
[SPEAKER_00]: water spray, but does have some
effectiveness, but can also burn the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: For outdoor locations, typically the
pressure can be greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while the indoor products can be
utilized, as mentioned here, systemic
[SPEAKER_00]: products typically are needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I caution you if you're
considering using systemic products,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in later stages of cannabis
development, as you don't want to impact
[SPEAKER_00]: your final product quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, these products have the greatest
chance at resistance, so rotations are
[SPEAKER_00]: advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no powdery, it can be a major problem
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this provides you with some
insight in identifying and controlling it
[SPEAKER_00]: if you do find it in your particular
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
Thank you.
