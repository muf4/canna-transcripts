[SPEAKER_00]: If you're considering adding sugar to help
your cannabis plants grow, this tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: university video is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at using
supplemental sugar for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might say sugar, we're not talking
about candy per se, but you kind of get
[SPEAKER_00]: the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as always, here's a reference article.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to look at researching on
sugar applications to crops may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily 100% specific to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But does allow some information we can
start to build some potential conclusions
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off here is their results from
their study.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a foliar sugar treatments
comparison here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see that their untreated
check, granulated sugar cane, high
[SPEAKER_00]: fructose corn syrup, molasses,
blackstrap molasses, granulated cane
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar, granulated cane sugar at 100%
sucrose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, blackstrap molasses looking at
different kind of application rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're kind of seeing the soybean yield
in bushels per acre kind of presented
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're all looking at soybeans,
but we can see that there's not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily a clear winner here in
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where would be benefits to sugar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, lady bees consuming sugar increased
the survival rate of the females and
[SPEAKER_00]: resulted in increased egg production as
compared to beetles who were not provided
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: In their diets, kind of an interesting
finding there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The researchers suggested sugar feeding is
very important for lady beetle populations
[SPEAKER_00]: and a possible way to help maintain
beneficial species in an agro ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lady beetles stayed about 20 to 30% longer
in plots where sugar water was applied
[SPEAKER_00]: than untreated plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first four to six hours after
spraying a sugar solution, lady beetles in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sugar treated plants rose by a factor
of 10 to 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of an interesting thing here where
we're maybe not seeing a change in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, but if we're trying to increase
and maintain our beneficial insect
[SPEAKER_00]: populations, well, this may have some
potential merit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant defense signaling related to
sugar in rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at rice production
in sugar, sugar applications to the root
[SPEAKER_00]: system resulted in overexpression of genes
in which induced defense mechanisms within
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, here we're looking at rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spraying sugar solutions on plants via
foiler in soiled drenches resulted in half
[SPEAKER_00]: the disease pressure that is in the
control plants one week later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of an interesting finding here,
looking at the changing in gene regulation
[SPEAKER_00]: in rice plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 days later, control plants exhibited
severe disease compared to the sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: treated plants, suggesting foliar
applications of sugar prior to an attack
[SPEAKER_00]: by a plant pathogen could signal plant
defense responses resulting in increased
[SPEAKER_00]: plant resistance to that particular
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The researchers also went on to note that
all plants were at the four leaf stage
[SPEAKER_00]: during research and were curious if they
induced resistance would continue as the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants matured.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it definitely shows potential promise
in rice for that early application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might be something worth considering for
cannabis production as well, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: that early application before you're
getting into your buds and flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not apply it to cannabis though?
[SPEAKER_00]: Research has shown no statistical
difference among sugar sources when
[SPEAKER_00]: applied to corn or soybeans with no
statistical increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Newest research studies have documented
increase in beneficial insects in fields
[SPEAKER_00]: and plus treated with sugar water
solution, suggesting application of the
[SPEAKER_00]: solution as a biocontrol method,
reducing pest populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if you have aphids and
want to increase your lady beetle
[SPEAKER_00]: population, well, sugar might be a worthy
addition, particularly in those early
[SPEAKER_00]: stages of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there's yet much research to be
done, sugar does play an important role in
[SPEAKER_00]: inducing plant defense responses and
recent studies have shown reduced disease
[SPEAKER_00]: levels in rice after application of sugar
prior to pathogen injection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just another consideration
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be a catch all save all?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: But does it have some potential benefits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those benefits match your growing
situations, then it might be worth
[SPEAKER_00]: considering adding to your cannabis
plants.
