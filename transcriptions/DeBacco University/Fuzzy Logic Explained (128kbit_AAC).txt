[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to explain what fuzzy
logic is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, fuzzy logic, if you're looking at
carbon dioxide controllers, often it's
[SPEAKER_00]: listed here, fuzzy logic mode,
fuzzy logic active, and what does that
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you find the controllers that do
have this as an option, those tend to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the better controllers, and you'll
understand why that is a little bit behind
[SPEAKER_00]: the technology of fuzzy logic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, standard controllers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, standard CO2 controller are either on
or off based on preset CO2 levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's kind of like flipping a light
switch on or off.
[SPEAKER_00]: These do not allow enough time for carbon
dioxide to mix with the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Standard logic CO2 controllers are used
for CO2 generators, but are not efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: to be used with bottle-based systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this on and off, the lights are on or
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: With fuzzy logic, though, consider it to
be a light on a dimmer switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having this variability or this
banding that can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, those controls with fuzzy logic,
they allow for that precise control and
[SPEAKER_00]: you sort of think of our light example
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can precisely dial in what that light
intensity should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes predictions based on past events
to create an environment that hovers
[SPEAKER_00]: around the target CO2 level without large
degrees of variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That includes large degrees of
overshooting or large degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: undershooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing important to remember that
fuzzy logic can not be used with CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: generators only for bottle-fed systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when you're looking at a controller,
it might say here says true fuzzy logic,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be something preferable to look
at and consider when purchasing a
[SPEAKER_00]: controller for your own operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, fuzzy logic related to temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuzzy logic has many applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, it can allow for variable
conditions that can be a mix of different
[SPEAKER_00]: situations rather than simply being on or
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the example here with temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of just having hot or cold
options, there can be a mix to get this
[SPEAKER_00]: warm, to generate a warm water combination
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, fuzzy logic, instead of being on
or off, hot or cold, it allows kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: that mixing to occur here to have that
kind of warm temperature possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fuzzy logic concept can be compared
also to a good driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if the driver approaches a red light,
we'll apply the brakes gradually to slow
[SPEAKER_00]: down before getting to the intersection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuzzy logic uses the same idea to bring
the CO2 levels up to the desired setting
[SPEAKER_00]: without going over the set.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're looking at a standard controller
and the driver example here, the brakes
[SPEAKER_00]: would either be fully on or fully off,
the kind of one option or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That fuzzy logic allows for that greater
gradual kind of control over the situation
[SPEAKER_00]: here versus just on or off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what helps make them more
efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: These microprocessors, so within this unit
is a microprocessor that can apply
[SPEAKER_00]: calculations to the injection schedule to
maintain CO2 levels efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Standard logic controllers will not make
these calculations and will continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: inject more and more CO2 until the room
reaches the set point and then turn them
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that point, if the air wasn't mixed
properly, that can cause an overshoot and
[SPEAKER_00]: then it can drop down to a certain level
and then keep injecting, keep injecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can cause some issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having this microprocessor, this applying
calculations ensures that while they might
[SPEAKER_00]: be more expensive initially, it can help
ensure that the CO2 that is being added to
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow room is added in an efficient
manner based on calculations of the
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why they're advised to be used for
growers to find a controller if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: adding CO2 from a bottle to get the ones
that have the fuzzy logic mode as an
[SPEAKER_00]: option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
