[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to describe some of
the basics of paper chromatography,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you might be familiar with,
producing pretty colors on paper based on
[SPEAKER_00]: using ink dyes as just a model example.
[SPEAKER_00]: To start off with, how does chromatography
in general work?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the basic components of how this
works?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it works through what's called
capillary action, and that's the movement
[SPEAKER_00]: of a liquid within the spaces of porous
material due to the forces of adhesion,
[SPEAKER_00]: cohesion, and surface tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see blue liquid, and we see the
different diameters of these glass tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As that diameter gets smaller,
we're noticing that that liquid is able to
[SPEAKER_00]: travel higher, and that's through
capillary action.
[SPEAKER_00]: The liquid is able to move up in the
filter paper because of the attraction to
[SPEAKER_00]: itself is stronger than the force of
gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: As those walls get closer, those forces of
attraction is greater, and they can travel
[SPEAKER_00]: further up this glass tube as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: In paper, the pores are very small as
well, and that allows it to, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: move and fight the force of gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The solubility, which is the degree in
which a material or solute dissolves in a
[SPEAKER_00]: solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solutes dissolve into solvents that have
similar properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called like dissolves like.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is that if a substance is
polar or has a charge to it, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: water is polar and has a charge to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A substance like that will be able to
dissolve very well in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something is non-polar, you might want
to use an alcohol base because that's also
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have a charge to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says like dissolves like that's getting
into the components of the properties of
[SPEAKER_00]: the solute and the solvent, looking at
polarity or charge being one key example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows different solutes to be
separated by different combinations of
[SPEAKER_00]: solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: What to look for is while you may see one
color initially, this is looking
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly at inks, there may be
separated into two or more individual
[SPEAKER_00]: colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will happen over time with certain
color spots traveling to the same distance
[SPEAKER_00]: within your paper chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some examples, the concentration of the
alcohol in the solvents is changing,
[SPEAKER_00]: resulting in different traveling distances
of the dyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see an example of how that
plays into the distance that certain
[SPEAKER_00]: colors will travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, go over the basic set up here
of paper chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the starting line.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the inks are initially
placed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that dots here, they're posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes through the center of that initial
ink.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that the liquid level is
below those inks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that liquid level initially
to come in contact with the dyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will dilute it into this mobile phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen is this mobile
phase is going to wick its way through
[SPEAKER_00]: this chromatography paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to move its way up against the
force of gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it does so, it's going to pick up these
dyes and separate them out based on their
[SPEAKER_00]: individual colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then have the finish line, which is the
highest point that the solvent travels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that stationary phase,
in this case, which is the chromatography
[SPEAKER_00]: paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example, it's all encased in a
beaker to keep everything contained.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chromatography over time, this doesn't
happen immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, you can have a really quick
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see how it very quickly will
progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example for this paper,
for this isopropylol, for this material,
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes about 30 minutes to run to the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see at 25, you have a pretty
good indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 would be the run time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you don't want to run it too
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or too little, because you want an
adequate separation without it
[SPEAKER_00]: overrunning, or you don't want everything
to be compressed either.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're observing our chromatography here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, the concentration can play
a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, this just shows you an
example of how it does play a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our different percentages.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an alcohol-based solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see at 0% alcohol, the dots barely
move at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we increase the percentage,
we're noticing an increase in distance of
[SPEAKER_00]: travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important to take into
consideration the properties of the paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: the coating on the paper, the solvent,
and what you're looking at separating.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, 100% looks like it does
produce quite a good separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though we do lose some of that yellow
color, at least in this example,
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks like to me, 70% offers a pretty
good separation, and you're still getting
[SPEAKER_00]: some of that yellow color in this dye
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at certain dyes, and again,
over those separation factors here,
[SPEAKER_00]: try to zoom in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highlight it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those dyes do separate into purples and
blacks, not soluble in low concentrations,
[SPEAKER_00]: partially soluble in concentrations
greater than 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use this same kind of model here
and look at blue dyes, we could see also
[SPEAKER_00]: not very soluble, but completely soluble
at higher concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, again, an example where you'd be
wanting to run this experiment at a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have green dyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's separated into blues and yellows,
which might be a little hard to see,
[SPEAKER_00]: but try to highlight some of them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's concentration of isopropanol is
greater than 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow soluble concentrations of
isopropanol are less than 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get this mixture of depending on
exactly what you want to separate,
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what you're looking for,
there will be an ideal concentration to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at and to be able to use for your
separation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, here we have red dyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just looking at the red dye, dyes separate
into reds and yellows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yellow soluble in low concentrations
of the isopropanol and less soluble at
[SPEAKER_00]: higher concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: One perfect amount of isopropanol to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what color you're looking at
investigating and how you want to separate
[SPEAKER_00]: that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red dye is slightly soluble in low
concentrations and more soluble at
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations greater than 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is something you want to
investigate further, based on these
[SPEAKER_00]: results, that is the concentration of
isopropanol that you should be using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
