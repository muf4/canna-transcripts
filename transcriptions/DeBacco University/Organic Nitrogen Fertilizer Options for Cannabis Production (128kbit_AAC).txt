[SPEAKER_00]: Here on Tobacco University we're going to
be investigating some organic forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen which are important for plant
growth and production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright let's get into organic and
nitrogen fertilizer options for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off options for organic growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are nitrogen only others and
nitrogen dominant ratio ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these contain only nitrogen
some contain blends of other nutrients as
[SPEAKER_00]: well which is important to take into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll cover blood meal, fish fertilizers,
bat guano as well as manure in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the blood meal first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well blood meal is a byproduct of the
slaughterhouse industry waste basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the highest concentrations of
nitrogen in any non-synthetic source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it is organic it can be over
applied so keep that in mind and it can
[SPEAKER_00]: burn plants due to the excessive ammonia
that would be produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for the fertilizers here I've tried to
provide kind of there's a link in the
[SPEAKER_00]: description to where I got the source from
but the typical NPK analysis, the time
[SPEAKER_00]: released, the pros, cons as well as
application rate that's recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now blood meal is $12.00 I've also seen
it's $13 sometimes $0.00 but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: basically all nitrogen with little or no
phosphorus or potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again that's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be on the more expensive side as if
you're looking for pound of nitrogen to
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into different types of fish
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's fish emulsion, there's
hydraulic sized liquid fish, there's fish
[SPEAKER_00]: meal, there's fish powder, there's a whole
bunch of different ones here and I'll kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of break these down so you can understand
that while fish fertilizer is one general
[SPEAKER_00]: category there's a couple other more
specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the first one fish
emulsion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well what fish emulsion is is kind of the
infamous for its foul smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emulsions are soluble liquid fertilizer
that have been heat and acid processed
[SPEAKER_00]: basically from fished waste and we can see
again all the same information provided
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see typical as these are 511 is
listed typically as 522.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again when you're looking at
applications be mindful of what particular
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer you might have be purchased
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the liquid fish or enzymatically
digested fish and probably of this of all
[SPEAKER_00]: the enzymatically digested liquid fish
products Neptune's harvest is probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: most named most people would recognize and
this is a digest of the nutrients from
[SPEAKER_00]: fished wastes instead of using heat and
acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So enzymes are using to kind of break this
process down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It retains more of the proteins,
enzymes, vitamins and micronutrients than
[SPEAKER_00]: emulsions do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why this is typically so commonly
used within growers and you can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: typical ratio compared to these a little
different so again just mindful of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have fish meal which is fish meal
is basically ground and heat dried fish
[SPEAKER_00]: waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little more variable a little bit harder
sometimes to kind of mix with water though
[SPEAKER_00]: it is water soluble may take a little warm
water a little more agitation to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: into solution so it can be utilized and
given to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to fish powder which fish
powder is dried with heat and turned into
[SPEAKER_00]: water soluble powdered form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's high source of nitrogen can be mixed
into solution injected to an irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: However while fish powder is supposedly
able to be injected into irrigation system
[SPEAKER_00]: if you are going to be utilizing that make
sure you have a filter because some fish
[SPEAKER_00]: powders are more soluble than others and
some may be too large of particles and may
[SPEAKER_00]: clog drip emitter lines for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure you have that filter to protect
yourself so your fish powder doesn't go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and clog all your potential
irrigation lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into bat guano.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bat guano are feces harvested from
caves and is a kind of a powered powerful
[SPEAKER_00]: powdered product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The powder can be applied directly to the
soil or mixed with water so it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: applied in irrigation water for delivery
to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again make sure you have a filter there so
you're preventing any clogging of any drip
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again also looking at you know they're
pasteurized with the the fish here fish
[SPEAKER_00]: meal keep in mind there are potassium and
phosphorus numbers as well and we see that
[SPEAKER_00]: also with the bat guano.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind there is cost associated with
bat guano can be on the more expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have to think about the carbon
footprint it took to get that fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly we have manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for manure it can come from cows sheep
poultry horses typically used as a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains more nitrogen and because of
this it's often used as the main reason
[SPEAKER_00]: for adding manure to soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: However manures nutrient content is small
compared to other chemical fertilizers it
[SPEAKER_00]: can also help with soil structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that the nutrient values
would depend on the source of the animal
[SPEAKER_00]: the bedding used and the amount included.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coarse manure is going to be a little
different from cow from sheep and poultry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically chicken manure will be your most
nutrient dense for comparison so keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also with manures if you are adding as a
soil amendment that may require to add
[SPEAKER_00]: higher amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: First year you'll get a lot of nitrogen
boost which will be great but the
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus and potassium can reside in
that soil for a number of years may
[SPEAKER_00]: causing you in years to come to switch to
a pure nitrogen source because the
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus and nitrogen sticking in that
soil and getting the benefits of the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't keep adding manure every year
because you're phosphorus numbers will
[SPEAKER_00]: likely become in the excessive and
potentially toxic range which could
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminate fresh groundwater.
