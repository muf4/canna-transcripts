[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at supplementing your
area with carbon dioxide and thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about mounting your sensor above the plant
height, this video is for you to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: about some of the things you should be
aware of with this sensor placement.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the video of
carbon dioxide sensor placed above plant
[SPEAKER_00]: height for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, you need to keep in mind
that carbon dioxide will naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulate at the bottom of a growing area
simply because carbon dioxide is heavier
[SPEAKER_00]: than air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a tanker that had a leak and
we notice it filling the bottoms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: streets and working its way up from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still see all the tops of the cars
because carbon dioxide being heavier is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to sink to the lowest points first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're looking at mounting our
sensor above plant height, this will
[SPEAKER_00]: typically result in an artificially lower
reading than the plants are experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're going through and dialing in
our sensor, we may want to keep this in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind for our controller to ensure that
we're still hitting that optimum level for
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a sensor location above plant height
is really only advantageous if the grower
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to know the lowest possible carbon
dioxide level in the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if there's an exhaust system low or
mid in the plant canopy, that may result
[SPEAKER_00]: in off readings as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the carbon dioxide injection point
is low in the structure and you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a reading for what's passing by the
plants as the structure fills with carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide, this would be another reason for
this above plant height sensor placement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because remember, if you have your grow
area and you add carbon dioxide at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom, it's going to start to fill up,
fill up, and then it's going to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: while to get to that sensor that's all the
way at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I say when the structure fills
with carbon dioxide, it's going to want to
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally accumulate to lower levels and
then work its way up a little higher,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little higher, and then it'll get to
your sensor, which is where you'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: getting your readings from your
controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my grower's suggestion is if this is
the only mounting location you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may want to set the target level a
little lower than the optimum to take into
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration the fact that the reading in
this grow space will be typically lower
[SPEAKER_00]: than what the plants are actually
experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because remember that carbon dioxide is
going to sink down, the sensor is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be way up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to give that time to kind of
fill up the area and you know that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be artificially a little bit
lower than what your base material of your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants will be experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at plant height might be worth
consideration if that's an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, keep these little tips in mind so
that you're still allowing the plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: receive the optimum levels of carbon
dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: in which your grow space.
