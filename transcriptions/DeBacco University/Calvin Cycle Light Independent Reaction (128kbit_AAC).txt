[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this video lecture is gonna go over
the Calvin Cycle, which is also called the
[SPEAKER_00]: light independent reaction, because it
itself does not require light specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a cycle, so you can see that it does
have to regenerate, and this is the steps
[SPEAKER_00]: that will go through and generate a
glucose molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go over and try to understand a
little bit more about the complexities
[SPEAKER_00]: that occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: To start off in the basics, the Calvin
Cycle has requirements of products from
[SPEAKER_00]: the light dependent reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are ATP and NADPH to transport those
high energy electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you remember going back to some of
the other videos, we studied the light
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at specifically the
Calvin Cycle, which is, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: using products from the light reaction and
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will ultimately generate a sugar or
glucose molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Calvin Cycle basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: An overview of the Calvin Cycle pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this is a cycle, that's
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a circle, and all of these are
different atoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highlighted here what all the different
colors correspond to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black is carbon, white is hydrogen,
red is oxygen, and pink is phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see kind of what's going on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is a cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have to regenerate the steps so we
can go through the cycle again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calvin Cycle is sometimes called the dark
reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of not the most accurate term
to use, because it can occur during hours
[SPEAKER_00]: of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part is it doesn't require light
for it to be able to perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does require products from the light
reaction, but it itself does not require
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs those products to be able to
complete the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly the ATP and NADPH are those
products from the light reaction that are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming over and needed for the Calvin
Cycle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, ultimately generating a sugar
molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's dive a little more into the
details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, where does this occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Calvin Cycle, if you're looking at our
chloroplast, occurs in the stroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the fluid inside the chloroplast,
but outside our thylakoid membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Calvin Cycle is very efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 90% efficient, versus the light
reaction only uses about 20% of the photon
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that's lost to heat and other
efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is very efficient, very
controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our overview, during the Calvin Cycle,
energy and electrons harvested in the
[SPEAKER_00]: light dependent reactions are used to
produce carbohydrates, and this example
[SPEAKER_00]: would be glucose molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing some of the products being
used, and we're seeing these three
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctive steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind we're in the stroma of the
chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one is carbon fixation, and this is
where carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: is attached to an organic molecule called
RuBP during this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second stage, myself out of the way,
second stage over here is the second stage
[SPEAKER_00]: is called reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in our reduction phase, the energy
and electrons in ATP and NADPH are used to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce carbohydrates, which in our case
here is glucose molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last stage is the regeneration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, this is a cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The energy from ATP is used to regenerate
the first substrate of the cycle RuBP,
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing this cycle to occur again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while it's important to remember this
needs to regenerate, it's also important
[SPEAKER_00]: to know a very key note that it takes six
complete turns of this Calvin Cycle to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce one molecule of glucose,
which is six carbons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we only have one carbon coming in
from this carbon dioxide, we need
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially this to repeat six times to
produce one glucose molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very important note with the Calvin
Cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the three phases, remember this
is a cycle very different than the
[SPEAKER_00]: electron transport chain that we talked
about in the light dependent reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: These three main stages we're going to
cover in a little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with the first stage,
carboxylation, we're fixing our carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon dioxide, I'm getting here,
is added to a five carbon sugar called
[SPEAKER_00]: RuBP by the Robisco enzyme, a very
important enzyme for essentially life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking our carbon dioxide, taking our
carbon here and adding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this carboxylation, the result is
an unstable six carbon molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: RuBP, you can see here, is five carbons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're adding a carbon dioxide molecule,
another carbon, creating an unstable six
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon intermediate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a Robisco enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be easily broken into two
more stable three carbon PGA molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two more stable three carbon compounds
called PGA are formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our five carbon with one carbon
from CO2 binding, creating this unstable
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediate, the six carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breaks apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to two three carbon PGA
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second stage is reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: PGA is reduced, requiring two steps in
products from the light reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where our ATP and our NADPH from
the light reaction are being integrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: A molecule called PGAL is formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: PGAL is the first stable sugar product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it kind of separating out
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This ultimately go on to produce our
glucose molecule, C6H12O2.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this reduction, ATP and NADPH are
used to convert the six molecules of PGA
[SPEAKER_00]: into six molecules of a chemical called
phosphoglycerdehyde.
[SPEAKER_00]: PGAL is what we're going to call it to
make it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a reduction reaction because it
involves the gaining of electrons from
[SPEAKER_00]: NADPH by PGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a refresher here, reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we call it reduction is the gain of
an electron by an atom or molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because electrons are negative,
when we're gaining these electrons,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're becoming reduced in the sense we're
reducing that charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we refer to when we say
reduced here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second part of this reduction phase is
six molecules of both ATP and NADPH are
[SPEAKER_00]: used making glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is obviously very energy intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those products from the light
reaction are used up during this.
[SPEAKER_00]: For ATP, the energy is released with the
loss of the terminal phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: For NADPH, both energy and hydrogen atoms
is lost converting to NADP plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: These is then going to go back to the
light dependent reaction to then be made
[SPEAKER_00]: into ATP and then reattached with the
hydrogen ion to make NADPH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these molecules return to that
light independent reaction to become
[SPEAKER_00]: reenergized so they can come back here and
participate in the Kelvin cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the reduction stage of the Kelvin
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third stage is regeneration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, this is a cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some P-gal molecules in ATP regenerate
RUBP.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get back where we started so
that we can add in our carbon dioxide so
[SPEAKER_00]: we can repeat the process again because
this is a cycle unlike the electron
[SPEAKER_00]: transport chain producing end resulting
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This regeneration has three main
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that only one of the P-gal molecules
leaves the Kelvin cycle and is sent to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoplasm to contribute to the formation
of other compounds needed by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a little part that's broken off
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're in the regeneration phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking right in this area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also going to be requiring ATP and
the whole point of this is to regenerate
[SPEAKER_00]: our RUBP molecule to bind another carbon
dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part two of this, since P-gal is exported
from the chloroplast, has three carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: atoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes three turns of the Kelvin cycle
to fix enough net carbon to export one
[SPEAKER_00]: P-gal, but each turn makes two P-gals thus
it makes six P-gals in total.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is a cycle so it gets a
little confusing, this has to go around
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple times to generate some of these
complex end products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last phase of the regeneration,
one is export while the remaining five
[SPEAKER_00]: P-gal molecules remain in the cycle and
are used to regenerate RUBP.
[SPEAKER_00]: This enables the system to prepare for
more carbon dioxide to be fixed and we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to regenerate and re-bind our
incoming next carbon dioxide molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three more molecules of ATP are used in
these regeneration actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the ATP is used here between
stages one and two, the carbon fixation
[SPEAKER_00]: and reduction, but there's also some to
regenerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulating the Kelvin cycle while products
of the light reaction can help regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The photosynthetic rate, if the light
dependent reaction is going very slowly,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not going to be as much ATP and
NADPH generated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can slow down the Kelvin cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though the Kelvin cycle does not
require light to function, it does require
[SPEAKER_00]: products of the light reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the amount of carbon dioxide present
can help regulate this phase also.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end here, I have a couple of review
videos if you want to review.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are independent links that you're
welcome to take a look at and hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: this tries to make it a little bit easier
to understand this complex process called
[SPEAKER_00]: the Kelvin cycle to generate glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching.
See you next time.
