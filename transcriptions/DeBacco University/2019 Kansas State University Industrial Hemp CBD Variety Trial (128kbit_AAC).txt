[SPEAKER_00]: On this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to go over this industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD variety trial, presented by Kansas
State University, and this has a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: great information that I think growers
need to be aware of, so I want to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: a summary here on Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the 2019 Kansas
State University Industrial Hemp CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: variety trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as always, if you're looking for more
information, here is the citation to go
[SPEAKER_00]: along with the research here, and a link,
and on the first page, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide with you the general summary,
kind of get at some of the main details to
[SPEAKER_00]: help you understand what this study
actually shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first off, they were looking at
outdoor and high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, while both technically fall under the
category of outdoor production,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that outdoor grown is outside
with full exposure to the elements,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in this study, plants were grown in
containers on weed fabric to help
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilize, fertilizer trials, but other
than this, it represents the typical
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor field conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants grown in a high tunnel,
this is a structure that looks like a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, and while it has plastic
coverings, you kind of see here,
[SPEAKER_00]: it lacks additional equipment to modify
the environment, such as an example,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be heaters, but it does act as
a little bit of a way to protect the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and a little bit more to kind of
moderate the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, outdoor interest and concerns with
outdoor hemp production is of interest
[SPEAKER_00]: because of reduced infrastructure cost
compared to indoor operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concerns with outdoor production is
unintentional pollination of flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will reduce the total cannabinoids
produced by plants as they will divert
[SPEAKER_00]: their energy to seed production,
and pollen can easily travel as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: three miles, but again, with increasing
distance, the percentage of successful
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination will diminish.
[SPEAKER_00]: While an outdoor environment provides many
plant necessities for reduced cost
[SPEAKER_00]: production, incidental pollination can
reduce the overall yield, and that was one
[SPEAKER_00]: concern by growers choosing to grow in the
outdoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the study objective here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the study objective was to evaluate
commercially available varieties of CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp in South Central Kansas grown in
containers, outdoors, or inside of a high
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnel, to test whether the covered high
tunnel could effectively reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination of the plants within it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, to try to maximize those yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what was studied here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's look at the plant material that
was utilized in the substrates as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: On June 17, 2019, clones from rooted
cuttings of each variety, located here in
[SPEAKER_00]: table one, were potted in one gallon
plastic pots, into seven gallon plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: pots, or into seven gallon fiber bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pots and bags were filled with
soilless potting substrate composed of
[SPEAKER_00]: pine bark, made by Happy Grow,
and half inch of screened pine bark
[SPEAKER_00]: nuggets in a one-to-one volume ratio,
amended with two pounds per cubic yard of
[SPEAKER_00]: dolomitic limestone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is great that this study provides
you with this level of detail to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: an idea of exactly the conditions these
plants were subject to.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the variety and the source,
you can see it right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some that you might be familiar with,
some that you may not be familiar with,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are all generally favoring the
cannabinoid CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the fertilizer treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, two fertilizer treatments were
studied, each incorporated into the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilizer rates were determined to ensure
an equal amount of nitrogen in both
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they didn't just give everything the
same, they wanted to make sure there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: equal and consistent amount of nitrogen
across all treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilizer one was conventional controlled
release fertilizer at 14.5 pounds per
[SPEAKER_00]: cubic yard of Osmocote Plus 15912.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see an example of that right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That included micronutrients as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's what the plus stands for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilizer two was an organic chicken
manure-based fertilizer called Turfmeat
[SPEAKER_00]: 423, right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incorporated at 65 pounds per cubic
yard in a micronutrient fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: Micromax, pictured right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was added to the substrate at 1.5
pounds per cubic yard to compensate for
[SPEAKER_00]: the lack of micronutrients present in that
organic fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the great thing about
scientific trials, that it offers this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of comparison and tries to keep some
things equal and limit the variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the outdoor and high tunnel layout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, plants were placed outdoors on a
container production pad or in an adjacent
[SPEAKER_00]: high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the outdoor plants, they were placed
on black ground cloth and fastened to a
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis wire to prevent blowing over in
the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the spacing plants were in rows six
feet apart with four feet spacing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great for growers looking at what type of
spacing they should use in their layout.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the high tunnel, it was 20 feet by 99
feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants were placed on the same
black fabric, ground cloth, on the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: surface as the outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that was kept consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Covering was clear polyethylene covered at
the top of the high tunnel with 30% white
[SPEAKER_00]: shade cloth over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sidewalls and endwalls were covered
with insect exclusion screen to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: insect pollinators from easily entering
the high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for spacing, the plants are spaced on
a four by four grid pattern, just as you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see here, as this is an image from the
trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the pruning method irrigation and
general experimental design.
[SPEAKER_00]: For pruning method on June 21st,
each terminal growing point was removed or
[SPEAKER_00]: pinched to encourage lateral branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants had been pinched twice
previously while in the one gallon plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: For irrigation throughout July,
plants were hand watered every other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the remainder of the season,
plants were watered daily via
[SPEAKER_00]: micro-irrigation spray stake in each
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, to help offer consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: The experimental design was a randomized
complete block design with split plot
[SPEAKER_00]: arrangement of treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole plot was high tunnel or
outdoors while subplots were container
[SPEAKER_00]: type in fertilizer form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Data was analyzed with ANOVA and being
separated with Fisher protected LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: LSD testing for those looking at the
stats.
[SPEAKER_00]: In-season nitrogen deficiency was noticed
on, this is kind of a picture from the
[SPEAKER_00]: trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: By late July, outdoor plants fertilized
with the organic fertilizer were smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: and displayed symptoms of nitrogen
deficiency or chlorosis in figure two,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we can see right here, compared to
plants on conventional fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since this was kind of noticed in-season
to prevent crop loss, outdoor and high
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnel plants with organic fertilizer were
top dressed with conventional controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: release fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harrell's 17612 Plus at 120 grams per
container on July 29th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to fertilizer application,
chlorophyll readings were taken on all
[SPEAKER_00]: plants with a handheld chlorophyll meter
or a spad meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: One measurement was taken on each of the
three individual fully mature leaves per
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and average to obtain chlorophyll
reading per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, great to know where those numbers
that you can look at came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great explanation in their
materials and methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So influence of container type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was no influence of container
type on any of the gross data collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Data wasn't shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So data presented are averaged across
container type, the plastic pots in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was no difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of merged them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the chlorophyll content readings,
as I talked about earlier, how they were
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the actual data generated.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the fertilizer form, organic or
conventional influenced all variety
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants growing with organic fertilizer had
lower chlorophyll concentrations than
[SPEAKER_00]: plants fertilized with conventional
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: An interaction between fertilizer form and
exposure, meaning high tunnel or outdoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: was observed in varieties ACDC,
cherry and the wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these three varieties, there was a
decrease in chlorophyll concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: between conventional and organic
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the difference was magnified
outdoors compared to the high tunnel
[SPEAKER_00]: produced plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chlorophyll concentration of plants
fertilized with conventional fertilizer in
[SPEAKER_00]: the high tunnel compared to outdoor plants
fertilized with conventional fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: were nearly identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to take a short pause of the
video here and look at this slide here,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the data actually presented,
looking at organic and conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers on the outdoors and in the
high tunnel situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at the plant height,
only ACDC and cherry height were affected
[SPEAKER_00]: by fertilizer form and their response was
opposite, which is kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant height of all varieties was highly
influenced by exposure, meaning growing
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high tunnel plants were much taller
than the outdoor plants, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: likely due to the less wind and reduced
photoinhibition that occurred in that
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: For CBD hemp, plant height is less
important than the amount of flora
[SPEAKER_00]: material, so take a look at the next
slide, but you can take a pause here and
[SPEAKER_00]: look at this data presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the number of colas, the primary
number of colas per plant was strongly
[SPEAKER_00]: influenced by the high tunnel environment
in all varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both cherry and super CBD were only
influenced by the high tunnel,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas the other varieties were also
influenced by the fertilizer form,
[SPEAKER_00]: and an interaction was observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All cherry plants in the outdoor plot had
completely senesced by the experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: termination, while the high tunnel plants
were alive and appeared as expected at
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conventional fertilizer increased colon
number in ACDC, Otto II's stout,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a greater than 100% increase in
colon number in the high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wife plants with conventional compared
to organic fertilizer, 68.6 compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: 32.6 respectively, so just an important
note there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see again the information,
which is great about these scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're looking at comparing these
varieties and not just looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: anecdotal information, here's some
scientific carried out studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we look at fresh weight,
considering the differences in plant
[SPEAKER_00]: height and number of primary colas,
it is not surprising that plants in the
[SPEAKER_00]: high tunnel had greater fresh weight at
harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just taking that previous observations,
not surprising here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many instances, fresh weight was
doubled in high tunnel compared to outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, the conventional fertilizer
also positively influenced the plant fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: weight, and the combination of the
protected environment of the high tunnel
[SPEAKER_00]: that produced taller plants, and the
improved nutrient source that created more
[SPEAKER_00]: highly branched plants, evident by the
increased number of colas, resulted in
[SPEAKER_00]: overall increased plant biomass at harvest
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you can look at the data here,
presented generally in the same form,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in this case, table five, looking at
fresh weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the cannabinoid production for the
outdoor plants, overall low cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: production due to not unexpected,
due to the fiber and dual purpose variety
[SPEAKER_00]: trial plot, approximately 400 feet north
of the high tunnel, an outdoor CBD variety
[SPEAKER_00]: plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: High rates of pollination were anticipated
with those outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wife had the highest CBD content at
4.6%.
[SPEAKER_00]: This variety also appeared to have the
most well-developed female flower buds and
[SPEAKER_00]: the lowest quantity of seeds, which would
correlate with the highest CBD content or
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid production.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC concentrations were all well below the
0.3 threshold for industrial hemp in all
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an important note to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that again presented on the
data right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you go to the high tunnel
plants, this area right here, some seed
[SPEAKER_00]: development was observed, but much less in
comparison to the outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD concentration reached as high as 9.9%
and 10.5% in the wife and cherry,
[SPEAKER_00]: respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is likely due to lower rate of
pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC was detected in most of the samples
and was below that 0.3% for industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, THC and ACDC was reported to be
0.4%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could be a little note of kind of
concern there.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, for everything else, definitely
below that 0.3% threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: The researchers also made notes on pest
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So although data was not collected,
significant pests were noted throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is important not only for this
trial, if you're looking at growing
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp in general, to be on a
lookout for these particular pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: For outdoor plants, the pest pressure was
straight with spotted cucumber beetles,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we can see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early in the season, damage is mostly
cosmetic and restricted primarily to
[SPEAKER_00]: foliar feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eurasian hemp borer was noted on several
outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Causing damage to the flower buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: No control efforts were attempted for this
pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the high tunnel, armyworms were a
nuisance and primarily controlled by
[SPEAKER_00]: scouting and removal by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their presence did not appear to have
any significant impact on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Russet mites were extensive on individual
plants during the outbreak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And heavily infested plants were removed
and replaced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lightly infested plants were pruned to
remove infested branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Predictive sprays, two times weekly for
two weeks of praethorin, which is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: form of pygianic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And azendra tank mix seemed to control the
pest for the remainder of the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep in mind to be on the
lookout for these particular pests,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they were shown in this study to
affect potentially the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now study objectives revisited here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, evaluate commercially available
varieties of CBD hemp in south central
[SPEAKER_00]: Kansas, grown in containers outdoors or
inside that of a high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Container did not impact plants to any
measurable degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an important note to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really didn't matter what containers
of plants were grown in.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as varieties go, the wife and
cherry varieties produced the greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of CBD in both outdoor and high
tunnel environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: High tunnel grown plants produced greater
CBD percentages than outdoor plants due to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced amount of pollination,
which is an important note.
[SPEAKER_00]: To test whether a covered high tunnel
could effectively reduce pollination of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants within while some seed development
was observed in the high tunnel,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was much less pollination compared
to plants in an outdoor plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a very important note to make
that maybe it is justifiable to have that
[SPEAKER_00]: expense of the high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lastly, just a quick general summary of
the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: For outdoor, organic fertilizer should be
used with caution due to the potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: increased nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the high tunnel environment,
I'd recommend if the chance for
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination exists in a particular field,
make sure to be using insect netting on
[SPEAKER_00]: the sidewalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to scout for russet mites
and armyworms as they were a notable pest
[SPEAKER_00]: in this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: For in general, the wife and cherry
varieties should be considered if the
[SPEAKER_00]: percent CBD is the main goal while still
keeping THC levels below that 0.3
[SPEAKER_00]: threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using a high tunnel will likely increase
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question to growers is, can the cost
of the high tunnel be justified by the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference presented here?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the important part about this
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you some information and now
you have to take this information and see
[SPEAKER_00]: how well it may apply to your particular
growing situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best of luck!
Thanks for watching!
