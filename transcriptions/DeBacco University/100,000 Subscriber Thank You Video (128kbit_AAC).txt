[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this DeBaco University 100,000
subscriber thank you video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to acknowledge across this
milestone and wanted to thank my viewers
[SPEAKER_00]: for allowing this to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into the short thank you
video here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here at DeBaco University, again,
the goal is to cultivate students to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond their teachers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an educational-based channel
that is focused on biology, forensic
[SPEAKER_00]: science, cannabis production with an
additional student series, and
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the milestones, there's over 1,200
videos on the channel, over 16 million
[SPEAKER_00]: views as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you everyone for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most watched video has over 1.4
million views and 24 videos have over
[SPEAKER_00]: 100,000 views.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I did have some comments here that I'd
like to go through and read and try to
[SPEAKER_00]: highlight just a couple of them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And reading over the comments and seeing
the positive influence, quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific-based information can have is
very encouraging to see and I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: thank everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Below are some recent comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would change nothing about any video on
this wonderful channel starting with
[SPEAKER_00]: research paper nearly brings me to tears
after wading through so many creators'
[SPEAKER_00]: attempts at academic cannabis education
throughout the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality of your videos is absolutely
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you present information reminds me
of my time in university.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot from your videos in the
last six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I avenged almost everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great informative video.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy makes the information easy to
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, DeBaco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Julie Hughes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say, you're an elite teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always great to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your work is truly beautiful from the
videos to the written summary and
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clearly a labor of love.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does take a lot of time, so always
great to get that appreciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make learning complex matters so easy,
which is a true mark of a master.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for making your videos
understandable, informative, and are
[SPEAKER_00]: greatly appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's the goal, to kind of take
some more complex topics and break them
[SPEAKER_00]: down into something that's a little bit
easier to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more content you give, the more I
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had more time to produce even
more content.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the best YouTuber ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure information, no games, no click bait,
and true scientific information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for another great video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best channel on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, always great to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I encourage everyone to help
spread the knowledge by subscribing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Share the channel with others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help spread this scientific-based channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subscriptions is just a simple way to say
thanks, and it's nice to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: subscriber count continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In short, just in closing, for all those
that have and will subscribe, along with
[SPEAKER_00]: the comments, simply put, thank you to you
all and great to get this wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplishment.
