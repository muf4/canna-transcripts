[SPEAKER_00]: Here in this Tobacco University video,
I go over how many roots does a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: clone need?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's not enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's too many?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to assess some actual roots
and give you an idea of what the ideal
[SPEAKER_00]: rooting is.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over how to evaluate
your cannabis clones roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what is a clone adequately
rooted?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that kind of ideal root?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a common question, and it
really has a variable answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to consider what substrate or
lack of substrate your plant will be
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the plant going to be going
ultimately?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how old is the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: With the variability, images will be
provided as a comparison for evaluation,
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly looking at clones that were rooted
in an aeroponic cloner, because we can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually see the roots in the structure of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, the goal of a quality clone is
to have a well-developed root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots are starting to branch, and the
length of the roots will actually support
[SPEAKER_00]: a growing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here with these initial roots
developing, it's a good sign, but not
[SPEAKER_00]: nearly adequately rooted enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of the image of what I
would consider to be the ideal rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's even rooting on all sides,
the roots are just starting to branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say branch, we're looking at these
small little development of these kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: root hair-like appendages.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a nice even white coloration to
the roots, and this makes for easy
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer into whatever selected substrate
the grower will be going into with the
[SPEAKER_00]: clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're starting to root, so what does
this kind of look like here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of flip these over, and while
these could be transferred at this stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is possible, typically I would
recommend you wait for another few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because while there's roots starting,
you want them just to kind of develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit further so they can be able to
support the plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, an aeroponic cloner is an ideal
environment, so the roots will likely
[SPEAKER_00]: develop faster to ease the plant
transition process, so they can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: produce more roots and faster with an
aeroponic system before you transfer them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's why wait just a little bit
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this rooting here looks like it would
be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be like what every grower would
want their roots to have, but this is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually a little bit past prime.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many roots, and this clone is a
little bit past prime, but only by a day
[SPEAKER_00]: or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does not mean it will transfer
poorly, but the multiple root hairs
[SPEAKER_00]: forming and multiple root branches forming
at the main site for nutrient absorption,
[SPEAKER_00]: so upon transfer, there will likely be
some damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just so many roots here,
no matter what media you're going to put
[SPEAKER_00]: it in or what substrate you're going to
put it in, you're most likely to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: damage to that root structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant, though, will likely be to
recover well, but be aware that those
[SPEAKER_00]: finer roots is where the majority of the
absorption of water and absorption of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients occurs in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: More branching is better than a thicker
root structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want a thick carrot root.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want that branching, but you don't
want to be damaging that branching,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's going to be damaging the
uptake of water and nutrients for your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have here where we just have
simply too many roots here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just kind of letting it sit in the
cloner a little bit too long, missing it
[SPEAKER_00]: by sometimes only a short duration of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can grow fast once they start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers should still be transferred to the
next stage, but realize they're a little
[SPEAKER_00]: past prime, and that will kind of hinder
that transition process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in the end, the plants will likely
perform well, but this may be a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: slower to make that transition,
since they are a little past prime,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little too much rooting is occurring
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clon can go quickly from no root to
too many, so daily inspections is
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended to catch that ideal day to
make the transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why so many growers like the
aeroponic cloner, this allows them to pull
[SPEAKER_00]: plants at the ideal time to ensure the
minimum amount of transfer shock or
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant shock that's occurring and
maximizing their production.
