[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBacco University video,
we're going to be looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis-based vapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at cannabis-based
vapes as an end product of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, looking at CT Pharma is one
company that does produce these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to focus on some of their
products as they have publicly available
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical reports and labels of the
products that they produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, the descriptions,
options, and uses are intended to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: an understanding of some of the end
products of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, those analytical reports are
important and often missed component that
[SPEAKER_00]: should accompany any product someone is
interested in purchasing, and you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: an example of one of those at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for ourself, what's just a general
description of the vapes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the vape cartridge is pre-filled
with high-quality, high-potency marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be high in THC or high in CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cartridges are color-coded based on
the strain type and come in half-gram
[SPEAKER_00]: sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here that they can
mass-produce them as well, and we see the
[SPEAKER_00]: labels being put on in that image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what are some options of vapes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, CT Pharma offers two different
styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pure vape cartridges, which are
standard cartridge that can be used with a
[SPEAKER_00]: 510 thread type of battery, or we see here
the peak slim disposable vape,
[SPEAKER_00]: and their pre-filled vape and the battery
combination that once completed can be
[SPEAKER_00]: discarded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're offering those options as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what are the general uses for vapes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, vapes are an alternative to standard
flour when it's used with ceramic heating
[SPEAKER_00]: element.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the cartridge evenly heats the oil
to the point of vaporization so it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: easily consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vaporization is an easy way of consumption
as you still receive a good taste in
[SPEAKER_00]: medical effects without leaving such a
large odor as you would with regular dried
[SPEAKER_00]: flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these examples of certificates of
analysis I was mentioning, many people are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to look at the terpenes and
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also remember you also need to be
concerned with the microbial analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals, mycotoxins, and pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your product is, your purchasing
is passing all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now while these look kind of bland and
boring, it's important to match up a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the numbers presented here should also
appear on the label as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right as a consumer to make
sure you have access to the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: original reports to back up the
information in numbers stated here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just part of being a well-informed
consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something many people overlook,
but it is your right as a consumer to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: for those analytical reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
