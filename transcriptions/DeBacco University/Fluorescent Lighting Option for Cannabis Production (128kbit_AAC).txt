[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this tobacco university video
where we're going to be looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescent lighting options for cannabis
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been considering fluorescent
lights, let's get into some of the details
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can make an informed decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best use for fluorescent lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluorescent grow lights are best known for
their propagation abilities, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to cannabis, simply due to
their overall low light intensities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be used for the full growth cycle
on low light demanding crops like lettuce,
[SPEAKER_00]: but is not advised for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're commonly used for the clones,
seedling, and young plant stages of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here them over the easy
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're best utilized when plants are
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fluorescent tubes can cover the
specific area of the young plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will cut down on the square footage
space and can help growers maximize their
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation space, potentially save money
on electrical costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These lights can also emit a full spectrum
or favor blue or potentially red
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths to help control the height of
the plants as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue color favoring will help keep the
plants small and compact by making sure
[SPEAKER_00]: the internodes are as tight as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red light will have a tendency to have
them stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here as a quick little
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now using fluorescent lights, so when
we're going through and using them,
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow lights have low heat output and
low light intensities when compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: CMH, ceramic metal halides, HPS,
high pressure sodiums, and LED light
[SPEAKER_00]: emitting diode options.
[SPEAKER_00]: The distance between the lights and plants
will vary based on the exact type of
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescent that is selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a good starting point is to leave
them about six inches or 15 centimeters
[SPEAKER_00]: away from the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights should be on adjustable hangers
so that the distance can be maintained or
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusted as the plants grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the plants grow you want to maintain
that same distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a large space will cause plants to
stretch and become light deprived.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why you want those lights to be
as close as possible without causing any
[SPEAKER_00]: negative effects such as plant burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how many hours should you be running
the fluorescent lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well since these should only be used
during the vegetative growth, the photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period should be kept 16, most growers
favor 18 hours plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, due to poor light intensities,
growers should be running these lights 20
[SPEAKER_00]: to 24 hours to keep the DLI as high as
possible, especially for cannabis which is
[SPEAKER_00]: a high light tolerant plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So simply because they produce such low
intensity light, running them for longer
[SPEAKER_00]: will allow the accumulation of energy over
the total day to be a little bit greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where growers may want to
choose to run their lights 20 or even 24
[SPEAKER_00]: hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two types of fluorescent light
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the T5 grow lights and the
compact fluorescent light or CFLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: For plant production, T5s are the option
that should be considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: T5 grow lights offer many advantages over
the CFLs in the sense that they're easier
[SPEAKER_00]: to set up, more efficient operation,
the bulbs last longer, but also be sure as
[SPEAKER_00]: a grower that you're using also a T5
ballast is being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are certain manufacturers,
I'll cover that in a separate video,
[SPEAKER_00]: but certain manufacturers you might want
to look at or consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going the fluorescent light
option, you want to be, for plant
[SPEAKER_00]: production, you want to make sure you're
looking specifically at comparison of T5 lights.
