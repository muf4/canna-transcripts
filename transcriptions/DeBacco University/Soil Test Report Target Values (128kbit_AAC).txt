[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this Tobacco University video,
we're going to go over soil test report
[SPEAKER_00]: target values to get you an idea of what
this actually means.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a soil test report back,
you might see this kind of green area
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is usually your target area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some labs will call it medium,
some will call optimum, but that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the target.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to be up here, and we'll
explain why you don't want to be over that
[SPEAKER_00]: or under that, why that's the goal area to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the goal, as I said, there is to be
in the optimum area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some growers think excessive is the
target, but this is false.
[SPEAKER_00]: Optimum is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having excess amounts of certain nutrients
can impact the availability of others and
[SPEAKER_00]: result in reduced growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Balanced nutrients allow for the optimum
growth of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the example or picture here of a
mountain, if you think about climbing up
[SPEAKER_00]: the mountain, you're getting more and more
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think it's going to go on forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you keep going, reach that optimum
or that peak, that's where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you keep walking, you're going to
go down this other way and start to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: your yields when you get into toxicities
or conflicting levels with other
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So common misconception here, if you look
at this nice graph here, I think it helps
[SPEAKER_00]: explain this sense that if there are more
nutrients than the plant needs,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can just take what it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a false statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a common misconception that
growers just want to like, I'll give it
[SPEAKER_00]: some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it doesn't need that much,
it'll just ignore that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants really don't have that option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are not a kind of buffet nutrient
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They impact many chemicals, reactions over
adding what will offset this balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also too much nutrients can cause
potential environmental contamination,
[SPEAKER_00]: not to mention wasted time and money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just kind of like,
eh, give it a bunch of nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: a buffet, and it'll kind of like pick out
what it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you want to be fertilizing your crops
and your plants to be in this optimum
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go in this above optimum range,
well, you're not getting any more yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're wasting time, you're wasting money,
and potentially you could be reducing
[SPEAKER_00]: yields and also increasing the odds of
environmental contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: All not good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adding more and getting less.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like this general concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this graph kind of shows it for
when you're adding, over adding fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: can have detrimental impacts in addition
to just increasing costs to the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also increases the chance for
environmental contamination and can also
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see the soil test levels and
the theoretical yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see very low, low, medium,
high here going through and we're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: to that kind of maximum yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we're applying maintenance
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we're fertilizing the plants
with the plants that we're moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Previous to this stage, we're kind of
adding a little bit more than the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: can uptake because we're trying to build
up that concentration in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, then we get to a point we want to
apply no fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we go much beyond that to the
excessive range, well, we start to get
[SPEAKER_00]: detrimental effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start to get toxicity issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start to get reduction in yield for
adding more fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this optimum rate is what makes
growing a little bit of a challenge in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of how close can you be within that
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the target should be the critical
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might hear growers talk about
critical level and this is basically
[SPEAKER_00]: indicated here and also generally
basically right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the critical level is the level at
which adding more fertilizer will not
[SPEAKER_00]: increase yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, you've now crossed over the
soil test value going above that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get any more yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the optimum range is a range,
not a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: The critical level is more so a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: The optimum range here will be a little
bit above that critical level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just in case you can overshoot by a
little bit, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you get above optimum, well,
now you've overshot too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get excessive, you could get
into toxicity levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there's this optimum range where
you're basically applying maintenance
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer If you get into that kind of
above optimum, you're applying no
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer because you just have excessive
amounts of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important for growers to realize
when they're at the very low, low and
[SPEAKER_00]: medium categories, adding more fertilizer
will increase their yields, but it's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: linear line forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you reach that critical soil target
level, get into optimum range,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're then shifting to only applying
maintenance fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep fertilizing at the rate you were.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get into that very high toxicity
levels and potentially reduce your yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And potentially contaminate the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both negative things that you can avoid by
realizing and knowing these target levels.
