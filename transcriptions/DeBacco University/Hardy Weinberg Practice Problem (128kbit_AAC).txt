[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, here I'm going to go over
Hardy-Weinberg practice problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will hopefully clear up any issues
you might be having and help give you an
[SPEAKER_00]: example and work it through so you can
understand the process that you go
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, don't practice until you get it
right, practice until you can't get it
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So review this as many times as you need
to and hopefully this will be overall
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful with you understanding the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Hardy-Weinberg problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down here, remember this is our equation
we'll be constantly dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to use a calculator to help
yourself work through this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So given a population of 100 individuals,
remember diploid individuals, so 200 total
[SPEAKER_00]: alleles, 16 exhibit a recessive trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the problem is to find the allele
frequencies for big A and little a and
[SPEAKER_00]: find the genotype frequencies for the
homozygous dominant, the heterozygous,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the homozygous recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all you would be given and you'd
be expected to find these answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video I'm going to go through this
stepwise process to help you gain some
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the allele frequencies we're going to
calculate first.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to go about doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well p plus q equals 1 and since p equals
big A and q equals little a, then we can
[SPEAKER_00]: simply say big A plus little a will equal
1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is something out of 200
plus 32 out of 200 will equal 200 out of
[SPEAKER_00]: 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to work with the total allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where did the number 200 come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the total alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did the 32 come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the 16 that exhibit the recessive
trait mean that they're these individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the homozygous recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 16 times 2 is the 32.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this equals the 16 percent,
then something plus 16 percent has to
[SPEAKER_00]: equal 100 percent, which means 84 percent,
because 84 plus 16 is 100, 84 percent are
[SPEAKER_00]: a combination of the homozygous dominant
and the heterozygotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in order to calculate what the
homozygous dominant and the heterozygotes
[SPEAKER_00]: are, we need to take this the next step
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 16 percent in decimal form is
represented by 0.16 and this is the same
[SPEAKER_00]: as q squared because our two little a's
are q and q or q squared represented right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that's our recessive or 0.16.
[SPEAKER_00]: We simply take the square root of that to
get q, which is 0.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if this one's 0.4, we know 1 minus q
equals p or 1 minus 0.4 is 0.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dominant allele here is represented
by 0.6 and the recessive allele by 0.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big help because now we can
start to input this into our equation and
[SPEAKER_00]: help answer the genotypic frequencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the phenotype frequency is,
if p equals 0.6 and q is 0.4, then we
[SPEAKER_00]: simply plug into the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: p squared is 0.6 times 0.6, which is here,
0.36.
[SPEAKER_00]: q squared is 0.4 times 0.4, which is 0.16.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the heterozygotes, 2pq, 2 times 0.6
times 0.48.
[SPEAKER_00]: What these decimals refer to is the
homozygous dominant represent 36 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: of the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heterozygous dominant is 48 percent
and the recessive is 60 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this is helpful in going through
an example here to help you understand how
[SPEAKER_00]: to calculate the Hardy-Weinberg equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to test your knowledge, here is
another question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fraggles are mythical mouse-like creatures
that live beneath flower gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the 100 fraggles in the population,
91 have green hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to represent with capital F.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nine have gray hair, lowercase f.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming genetic equilibrium, what are the
gene frequencies of big F and little f?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are the genotypic frequencies?
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to pause the video here so
you can go through and work this problem
[SPEAKER_00]: on your own before I proceed with the
answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're going to proceed now with
the answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you can compare your own to the
answers that I have presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the answers are simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: F is 0.7, little f is 0.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going through our Hardy-Weinberg
equation, as you can find at the beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: of this video, the homozygous dominant is
49 percent, the heterozygous is 42
[SPEAKER_00]: percent, and the homozygous recessive is 9
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another graphical representation
to help you work through the problem and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of shows it with the Punnett square,
if that helps you understand that a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I invite you to go back and review
this video so you can feel comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: calculating with the Hardy-Weinberg
equation.
