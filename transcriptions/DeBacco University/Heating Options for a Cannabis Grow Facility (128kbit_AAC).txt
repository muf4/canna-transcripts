[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here on this DeBaco University
video, I'm going to discuss heating
[SPEAKER_00]: options for a cannabis grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because many of the times lights do
produce heat, but in particularly northern
[SPEAKER_00]: climates, we need to be aware of ways to
heat that facility so that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining a normal plant growing in
supportive environment for our cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look into some heating
options for a cannabis grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, keep in mind, object or goal number
one is to keep the plants happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis plants typically prefer
temperatures in the 70s Fahrenheit,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 to 25 degrees Celsius, which often
means if a grower is going to grow all
[SPEAKER_00]: year, heating system is usually a
necessity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: To look at and address how you're going to
heat your grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that lights do produce
heat and that is a byproduct of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the heat that the lights should be
taken into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may allow you to downsize your
heating operation, but a lot of times
[SPEAKER_00]: still an external heat source is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have to think about during the
dark period of lighting may need to help
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain warm conditions for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When those lights are off in the flower
period, you're going to be off for those
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at what heating
options there are, these are the four main
[SPEAKER_00]: types that will be covered in this video
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at electric heat, oil heat,
wood heat, and propane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll look at some of the advantages
and disadvantages of each here so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get a better understanding of how they
compare to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting first with electric heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages is it's instant,
basically comes right on and immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: starts heating up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It offers very precise control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a thermostat that really can
regulate electric heat very precisely.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages to electric
heat is that it tends to be expensive and
[SPEAKER_00]: can require circuit setups that might be
beyond the means of what is normal for a
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have to redo a lot of electrical
work, which might cost time, may cost
[SPEAKER_00]: money, and might not be possible depending
on the area you're located.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is oil heat and the advantages
is that you can store it in large
[SPEAKER_00]: quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's readily available.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages is that it does
require maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to have a tank and a place to
store that tank safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for oil heat, there are some pros.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have that reserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you have as far as
quantities go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you do have to maintain the equipment
and have to have a place to store that
[SPEAKER_00]: tank as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's wood heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the advantage of heating a grow
facility with wood is it can be a less
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive form of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also can be a very reliable heat
source.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantages is that it's a dirty
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of soot and ash that can
develop as a byproduct of burning wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it needs to be fed manually
in, say, for example, a wood stove.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while that wood may be easy to get,
it does require that manual feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a last type that I do want to
mention here, and that's propane heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one that has advantages
because it can be used as a carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: enrichment source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean in burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the disadvantage is that it's often
limited storage options can be expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when needed the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually high points of demand can be
difficult to get and or expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be concerned the advantages
and disadvantages of each of these heat
[SPEAKER_00]: sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a selection and look at the channel
here for more details on whatever heat
[SPEAKER_00]: source you're choosing to heat your grow
facility.
