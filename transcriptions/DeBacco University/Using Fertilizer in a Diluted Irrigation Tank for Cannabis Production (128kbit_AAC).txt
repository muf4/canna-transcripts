[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's important to not overlook
simplicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at a diluted
irrigation tank for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, if you're looking to add fertilizer
into your irrigation water, well simply
[SPEAKER_00]: diluting it in an irrigation tank and
pumping it out to the plants can be an
[SPEAKER_00]: effective way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to cover using
fertilizer in a diluted irrigation tank
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is by far the simplest method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a grower is irrigating from a tank
anyway, this makes sense and is an easy
[SPEAKER_00]: method for adding fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only requires a water tank and a water
pump and I put even maybe you can
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially even gravity feed it to plants
for using drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very simple, doesn't require a lot of
parts and typically parts growers might be
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the two options here or two
components that you would potentially need
[SPEAKER_00]: with a tank in the pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tanks should be blocked from light to
prevent algal growth as it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: increased through the addition of diluted
nutrients in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see here somebody putting black
tarp in some way blocking the light,
[SPEAKER_00]: spray painting the tank in some way can
also help potentially heat it and also
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent algae from growing on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the pump to make sure the
components can handle the salts or
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients that will be added to the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not wearing out any internal
components as this may cause corrosion and
[SPEAKER_00]: or wearing out the pump parts faster than
if it just was normally with irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it does require some calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just a kind of mix and let go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of fertilizer to add should be
added to the tank and allowed to mix fully
[SPEAKER_00]: with the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't just want to go in through and
splash in your nutrients and just let it
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recirculating that, mixing that up in some
way is definitely advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have the fertilizer set on the
tank either, especially if it sits for a
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time as this could increase the
odds of plant damage, especially if the
[SPEAKER_00]: water is being applied to the leaves or
via head irrigation methods, overhead
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're not using the whole tank
and it settles to the bottom, your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: could get a much concentrated,
more concentrated dose than you'd want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could also cause plant damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep a couple of these few
things, simple things in mind might be a
[SPEAKER_00]: set of you already have in place,
go through, add it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need any special equipment and
the plants will thank you.
