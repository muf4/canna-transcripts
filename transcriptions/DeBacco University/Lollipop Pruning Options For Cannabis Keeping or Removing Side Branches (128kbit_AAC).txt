[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this DeBaco University video
where we're going to be looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: lollipop pruning options for cannabis,
whether you're keeping or removing the
[SPEAKER_00]: side branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see Kiara showing in a comparison
of two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to walk you through some of the
details and we'll go out to the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: and Kiara will show us the comparison of
those two plants she's sitting next to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, lollipop pruning's
definition is that lollipop pruning
[SPEAKER_00]: really's goal is to focus the plant's
energy on the top part by removing the
[SPEAKER_00]: lower branches resulting in a lollipop
appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see what a kind of a plant would
look like initially, remove these lower
[SPEAKER_00]: branches, you're kind of focusing that
energy towards the top portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it says removing the lower branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are typically referring to the ones
closest to the container or ground level.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some more aggressive versions of
that as we'll see a comparison here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is a botanical support for this
method and it's why it's implemented quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant portions that simply receive
less light intensity are typically poor
[SPEAKER_00]: contributors to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by removing the lower branches and
leaves of the cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: this increases the overall plant
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: But looking at these six buds here,
these would be more towards the top
[SPEAKER_00]: receiving more light typically and these
popcorn or smaller size buds, B grade
[SPEAKER_00]: buds, be more towards the sides simply
receiving less light on those side
[SPEAKER_00]: branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the benefit of the lollipop method is
that with the lower portions of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: removed, this can help increase airflow
and help reduce the potential for disease
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only does it benefit with more
plant materials getting more of the light,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can also help increase your airflow
under the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the general lollipopping process,
this is while the best time really depends
[SPEAKER_00]: on the cultivar you're choosing to grow in
the environment, typically this is done in
[SPEAKER_00]: the late vegetative stage or early
flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general about 15 days before and 15
days after flowering is the critical
[SPEAKER_00]: window when you want to be really
implementing this method or committing to
[SPEAKER_00]: this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going with the screen of green
or scrog method as we can see implemented
[SPEAKER_00]: right here, you're likely doing a form of
lollipopping already just kind of keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: everything on that same level there with
the screen method in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now indoor or outdoor growing,
where would you implement this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used in both situations but
since the sun travels across the sky,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a less beneficial pruning method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor applications or others that have
less degrees of light that travel tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit more from this method because
you're kind of focusing more in a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now two different takes on basically this
same method here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditionally growers like to simply
remove the leaves and keep most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: side branches and the exact amount really
is up to the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: An unconventional method kind of more
shown here is where the side branches are
[SPEAKER_00]: completely removed which will result in a
plant that represents more of a palm tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does result in a thicker central
stalk but still requires staking.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant is topped meaning cut down
the apical meristem is removed,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can have a similar number of growing
tips compared to the traditional method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the traditional method as I'm kind of
using here is again it maximizes the
[SPEAKER_00]: branch meristems which should in theory
result in many buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: However the bud size may be reduced if all
branches are kept for the full plant
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping four main branches will probably
give you the highest amount of A quality
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more you keep you are going to start
to see a reduction in size because a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: can only produce so much energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an easy method to employ and tends
to do best when implemented with some form
[SPEAKER_00]: of screen of green method where you're
keeping all of these branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the unconventional methods I kind of
shown here, in tight plant spacing this
[SPEAKER_00]: does allow for improved airflow under the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trimming can also be a little bit more
difficult and this does require more
[SPEAKER_00]: frequent prunings of the side branches
because you are going through and removing
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those side branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see even at this small stage the
importance of plant staking because the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants will be top heavy but the main stem
that you will notice will thicken to help
[SPEAKER_00]: support the structure compared to if you
were keeping all of those side branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just a kind of recommendation here,
if you're going with the traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: method use this in most cases especially
if you're utilizing the screen of green
[SPEAKER_00]: method where you're keeping all those
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unconventional method here where
you're really removing a lot of those side
[SPEAKER_00]: branches best implement if you're looking
to clone a plant because you can take
[SPEAKER_00]: those side branches off and clone those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remove the side shoots with the timing of
plant growth and also be careful when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're choosing to top that plant remove
that apical Maristown and you'll get a
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent number of clones and be able to
harvest the mother plant even though the
[SPEAKER_00]: yield will most likely be lower than the
traditional method depending how
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive you are with the side shoots
and branches you're removing and limiting
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to go out to the
greenhouse there and Kira is going to show
[SPEAKER_00]: us in the greenhouse a comparison to two
lollipopping methods with plants nearing
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the vegetative cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows you to see both and make an
informed decision on what method you would
[SPEAKER_00]: like to implement in your operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind this is in a greenhouse these
are fairly large plants but we'll go out
[SPEAKER_00]: to Kira and hear her comparison of these
two methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi so today we're back at DG Agtech
comparing two different forms of lollipop
[SPEAKER_01]: pruning.
[SPEAKER_01]: On my right we have a much more intensive
form of this lollipop pruning as you can
[SPEAKER_01]: see many of the branches are missing in
comparison to this other one and we have
[SPEAKER_01]: just a much wider and larger bigger stalk
here in comparison to this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this one just has the leaves taken off
of all of the branches as opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: taking all of the branches off like this
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see this has a little bit of a
thinner branch in the middle but more
[SPEAKER_01]: branches coming out the side more yield up
on the top which will need eventually more
[SPEAKER_01]: support than if you were to just do it
this way but the con with this way is that
[SPEAKER_01]: after a while you can see that it starts
getting pretty top-heavy so you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to need support using netting either way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our yield at the top is pretty similar as
you can see we don't have big differences
[SPEAKER_01]: just based on this pruning method so at
the end of the day it is really up to you
[SPEAKER_01]: as a grower to decide what best fits your
operation when it comes to pruning each of
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: you you
