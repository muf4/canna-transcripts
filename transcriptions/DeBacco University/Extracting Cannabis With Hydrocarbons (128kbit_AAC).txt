[SPEAKER_00]: If you've looked at hydrocarbons to work
on extracting cannabis, one, be cautious,
[SPEAKER_00]: but two, hopefully this video here on
Tobacco University will provide you a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more detail with this
extraction process.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at extracting
cannabis with hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the general description of the
extraction method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it is a closed loop system and plant
material is placed in the extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: vessel and then cold hydrocarbon such as
butane or propane is washed through the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have kind of a column example.
[SPEAKER_00]: The waxes, fats and lipids from the
cannabis bind to the hydrocarbon and the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material is then removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resulting mixture is then cold boiled
in a vacuum and the butane evaporates as
[SPEAKER_00]: butane and propane have very low boiling
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the resulting extract is collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of again see here we have the
solid solvent is chilled down to low
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures, so it washes over,
cannabis packed into a column.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis and terpenes separate from
that plant material and they create a kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a crude oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the collection tank where the
solvent crude oil mixture enters and then
[SPEAKER_00]: heat is applied to evaporate the solvent
and then we kind of see the crude oil
[SPEAKER_00]: being collected and then a compressor
pulls the evaporated solvent, pulls out
[SPEAKER_00]: the tank, condenser tank, condensed tank
cools, the solvent vapors back into a
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid form and the solvent can be turned
back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can have this closed loop system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in theory, it seems pretty good,
pretty efficient and it can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we're dealing with hydrocarbons
and butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be cautious with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the resulting end product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that resulting end product of
hydrocarbons come from a variety of forms,
[SPEAKER_00]: textures, consistencies based on the
protocol it's actually used.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all compressed by the broad term
butane hash oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examples and end products are shatter,
batter and crumble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoid concentrations average which
is in the 80 to 90% range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the advantages of this system
was that it does preserve the terpene and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid content very efficiently
compared to other methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a wide range of extract types
that can be achieved through hydrocarbon
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction and it can be done with trim
and flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has relatively low equipment and
run cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we kind of see here, a simplified
version of that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, with any system, there are
disadvantages and one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantages we'll put in kind of all
caps here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be extremely dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Butane and propane are highly flammable
and extreme caution must be used when
[SPEAKER_00]: extracting with hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also unwanted compounds could make it
through the extraction process and it
[SPEAKER_00]: would need to be later refined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about
hydrocarbon extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are kind of looking at it,
definitely make sure that you are cautious
[SPEAKER_00]: when utilizing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're understanding your
equipment very well so you don't create a
[SPEAKER_00]: very dangerous situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about
hydrocarbon extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk a little bit about
hydrocarbon extraction.
So let's talk a little bit about
hydrocarbon extraction.
