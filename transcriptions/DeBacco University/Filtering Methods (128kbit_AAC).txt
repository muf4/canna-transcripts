[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to go over different types
of filtering methods, even though the
[SPEAKER_00]: basic idea might be the same, there's
different methods to approach it and that
[SPEAKER_00]: will depend on the protocol or the
materials you're looking at filtering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a feed, here we have a
barrier, and then we have the filtrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing that these larger
molecules are being stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: These smaller ones are allowed to pass
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at filtration in general,
separation technique used to isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: solids from liquids or gases using a
selective medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might be most familiar with that with
coffee and filter paper associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: isolating coffee grounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Filtration terms, the suspension is the
initial mixture or solution and the fluid
[SPEAKER_00]: that passes through the filter is called
the filtrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's kind of getting through
the pores here and that's ultimately what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're collecting in the container down
below here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common forms of filtration will include
brewing coffee, your kidneys, a form of
[SPEAKER_00]: filtration process, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vacuum cleaners are filtering out and
aquarium filters are all, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: examples of areas that you might be
familiar with filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The filtration methods, there's different
methods exist to best match the given
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example is the solids suspended or
dissolved in the fluid that may influence
[SPEAKER_00]: what type of method you choose to use and
which would be the best to allow the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest extraction and separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, frustration uses gravity to
filter the mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solids remain in the filter while the
liquid will pass through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might be familiar with doing some
sort of labs like this where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting a bunch of liquid and solids
suspension and then you're allowing it
[SPEAKER_00]: over time to gravity pull it through and
collecting that liquid below.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's other forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a vacuum filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Buechner flask and a hose are used to
create a vacuum here to pull the fluid
[SPEAKER_00]: through the filter, typically with the aid
of gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, instead of we were waiting
forever for gravity to kind of pull this
[SPEAKER_00]: through, with this setup, with this being
sealed here and pulling kind of a vacuum
[SPEAKER_00]: to some extent, you're then helping this
process along and you still have gravity,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're still working with gravity,
but you're kind of speeding that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is great for substances that may
take a very long time to filter if you
[SPEAKER_00]: were just to use gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we go on to hot or cold filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So different temperatures will be
utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to encourage, that'd be cold
filtration or minimize, that'd be hot
[SPEAKER_00]: filtration, crystal formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking at heating something
up here, that's going to minimize the
[SPEAKER_00]: formation of crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to be using it in a
cold way, here's an ice bath that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to encourage the formation of crystals
through the filtration process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get on to different types of
filter paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where qualitative filter paper is
used in applications that are routine
[SPEAKER_00]: separation to determine identifying of
those materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's quantitative, used where the
precipitates to be covered, typically used
[SPEAKER_00]: with vacuum filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to identify specific materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the quantitative filter paper is
more precise and is more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't need that high level of
detail, typically you'll be using a
[SPEAKER_00]: qualitative filter paper there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're labeled right on the box,
qualitative or quantitative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, quantitative used for specific
purposes, qualitative a little more broad
[SPEAKER_00]: base and less expensive.
