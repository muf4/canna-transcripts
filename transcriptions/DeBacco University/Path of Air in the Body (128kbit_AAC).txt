[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're re-looking the path of air in
the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this shows a nice overview of the
nose, the larynx, the trachea,
[SPEAKER_00]: the right lung and left lung.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at this in a little
bit more detail and be able to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these portions on how air moves
through our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first part, respiratory system
zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one is the conducting zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This provides rigid conduits for air to
reach sites of gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're looking at is to be the
nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nasal cavity, the pharynx and the
trachea is up in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: These rigid zones stay open all the time
and they're what's allowing air to both
[SPEAKER_00]: enter and also exit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the conducting zone,
we have the respiratory zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the actual site of gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: This occurs in the bronchials,
the alveoli, ducts and the areas down kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of within the lung that we typically think
of as where gas exchange is specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we have our respiratory muscles
such as the diaphragm which is located
[SPEAKER_00]: down here and other muscles that help
promote ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our zones are the areas where we're
having that actual either gas exchange or
[SPEAKER_00]: areas of gases to move through and the
respiratory muscles are what's helping
[SPEAKER_00]: move that air both in and out our
respiratory zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, looking a little bit more
specifically at the path of air,
[SPEAKER_00]: air normally enters through the nostrils,
passes to the larynx which is here,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is our voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The voice box and then to the trachea and
then it goes to the bronchials of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tracheal tube is formed by stacked
C-shaped pieces of hyaline cartilage.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is they're not solid rings
but they're actually C-shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a bunch of these C-shaped
rings kind of all piled on one top of one
[SPEAKER_00]: another allowing some areas of kind of
compression here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can think of it kind of like being
able to move but that C-shape is able to
[SPEAKER_00]: hold it open to allow air to exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, the lungs hang free in the
thoracic cavity and air tubes called
[SPEAKER_00]: bronchus connects each lung to the
trachea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, the lungs contain millions
of these alveoli, many, many, many of
[SPEAKER_00]: these because this is the actual site of
gas exchange between the air and our
[SPEAKER_00]: blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thoracic cavity is bound to the bottom
of the thick layer of muscle called the
[SPEAKER_00]: diaphragm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the diaphragm is located down here and
that will move and help us be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow air to come into the lungs and also
exit.
[SPEAKER_00]: These alveoli are tiny sacs in the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see them here allowing CO2 and
oxygen to be exchanged.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows for rapid gas exchange due to
the extremely high surface area to volume
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio that they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also, I think this image is a
great job showing this, surrounded by a
[SPEAKER_00]: network of capillaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want these blood vessels to be very
thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows the red blood cells to travel
one by one allowing for the max rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want our CO2 to diffuse out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want our oxygen to diffuse in and
that's what we see going on both here and
[SPEAKER_00]: also here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of intense network is very
evident in both of these images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give you that overview of the respiration
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look in those tiny airways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're branching from a large area
to a smaller to a smaller to these tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: little air pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have our alveoli here, which is our
tense network of capillaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's allowing for the actual gas
exchange to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's helping our cells diffuse
out the carbon dioxide and diffuse in the
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a reminder, keep in mind that none of
this is occurring by active transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all simply by diffusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: By simply having a greater concentration
of oxygen here and a lower concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: of oxygen in the blood in this case,
oxygen will naturally diffuse in and
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide as a result will diffuse
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is that general overview of the
respiratory system related to our gas
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
