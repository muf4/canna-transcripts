[SPEAKER_00]: All right, in this video, I'm going to go
over the Hardy-Weinberg principles and
[SPEAKER_00]: also an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, after we go through this graph
here, we'll make a little bit more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with evolution in populations,
evolution is a change in allele
[SPEAKER_00]: frequencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hypothetically, what if conditions
would cause allele frequencies not to
[SPEAKER_00]: change?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a non-evolving population,
there's five key factors that need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, it has to be a very large population,
size with no genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: There needs to be no migration in or out
of the population, eliminating gene flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no mutations, so there's no change in
the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Random mating, so there's no selection of
any individual or phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no natural selection that's occurring,
meaning everyone is equally fit for the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no advantage to be one or the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hardy-Weinberg equation is true only
if these five things are met.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said here, terms and conditions do
apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large population, random mating,
no mutations, no migrations, and no
[SPEAKER_00]: natural selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rarely does this exist in nature,
but this does allow this equation to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hypothetically, a non-evolving
population preserves the allele
[SPEAKER_00]: frequencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It serves as a model, which in this case,
we're going to call the null hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a null hypothesis is, this is
referring to an area where if we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesis, we have a question,
calculated mean for the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a small difference,
we fail to reject the hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the null hypothesis there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do, we have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have enough data to reject the
hypothesis, meaning it was wrong or we're
[SPEAKER_00]: proving it to not be accurate,
in the case this be a large difference,
[SPEAKER_00]: this results in rejection of the
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So values that support the null hypothesis
occur in the green region, and values that
[SPEAKER_00]: do not support the values supporting the
alternate hypothesis occur in the red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the extremes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So natural populations rarely are in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is a useful model to measure
the forces acting on a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: A null hypothesis means insignificant or
no relationship between two variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: No difference is one way to consider it
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium,
made by a mathematician with the last name
[SPEAKER_00]: Hardy and a physician with the last name
Weinberg, came together, and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned with questions like,
what happens to frequencies of alleles in
[SPEAKER_00]: a population over time, and would you
expect to see alleles disappear or become
[SPEAKER_00]: more frequent over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're working with diploid and
Mendelian population here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this population genetics is a study of
properties of genes in a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic variation in a population puzzled
scientists, and this was one way that they
[SPEAKER_00]: seek to try to explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at, point out, in large
populations with random mating,
[SPEAKER_00]: allele frequencies remain constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dominant alleles do not, in fact,
replace recessive ones, as was once
[SPEAKER_00]: thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through the process of random mating,
there's no advantage to any phenotype or
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a sort of mating,
which is showing that there are,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, these bugs tend to mate with
ones of the same size.
[SPEAKER_00]: This non-random mating here would be the
same color would be mating together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about random mating,
where this color bug will mate with any
[SPEAKER_00]: other color bugs at within equal chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's getting to a little bit of an
example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a population of 100 tigers,
to make it easy, and it's 84 orange and 16
[SPEAKER_00]: white.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 84 out of 100 is really easy,
it's 84%, and 16 out of 100 is 16%.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, because we're gonna work with
these in a math equation, we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: convert those to decimals, so we simply
divide by 100, 84%, it's .84, 16% is .16.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, a population that is in
Hardy-Wandberg equilibrium is not
[SPEAKER_00]: evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's not 100, you take the number of
individuals and divide it by the total
[SPEAKER_00]: number of individuals being considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it being 100 makes it
greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy, but if this number was to
differ, you take your individuals divided
[SPEAKER_00]: by the total.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get to an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming two alleles, big B and little b.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dominant allele is gonna be,
of course, big B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recessive allele is gonna be little b.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in the Hardy-Wandberg equation,
the dominant's gonna be represented by
[SPEAKER_00]: this letter P and recessive by Q.
[SPEAKER_00]: So P plus Q, if we only have A and B,
must equal one or 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have the examples here of tigers
that we're gonna work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a couple links to some
information about white tigers in another
[SPEAKER_00]: PowerPoint if you're interested in
looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Hardy-Wandberg equation
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: P squared plus two P Q plus Q squared
equals one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does all this refer to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, homozygous dominant is P times P,
which is where your P squared comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is represented right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Homozygous recessive, remember we changed
our little b's to Q's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Q times Q, which is Q squared,
that's represented by this individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heterozygous make it a little
confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's P times Q plus Q times P,
which is simplified as two P Q.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all set to equal one to represent
100% of the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our equation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember our common allele, the dominant's
b, is designated by the P here,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is gonna be here, our homozygous
dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our less common allele or recessive one is
designated as Q.
[SPEAKER_00]: And P plus Q must always equal one to
represent 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: A dominant allele b is for the orange
color, and recessive allele will produce
[SPEAKER_00]: the white color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So individuals of homozygous for big B can
be represented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are our homozygous recessive for the
allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our heterozygous, our one big
B, one little b.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here's kind of relating that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this will make it a little bit
easier to understand with our P
[SPEAKER_00]: representing our big B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our Q representing our little b.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we only have a choice between two,
so that has to equal 100% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have our P squared
representing our big B, big B,
[SPEAKER_00]: homozygous dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Q squared equaling or representing our
homozygous recessive, two little b's,
[SPEAKER_00]: and our heterozygous as big B,
little b.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all equal one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a population of 100 tigers,
84 orange, 16 white, how many of each
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype exist is the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go through and let's calculate
that in this box here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, remember our recessive, the 16
white, we know is going to be 16%,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we know what that genotype is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't assume we have a consistent
amount for the dominant, because remember,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be homozygous dominant or
heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to start with the homozygous
recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 16% represented by 0.16.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bb or Q squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get to Q or just b, we have to take the
16 and square root it to get 0.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we know that 0.4 plus x must equal
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, 1 minus 0.4 would be 0.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dominant allele or the big B,
represented by P here, would equal 0.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the genotype frequencies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have to remember that we must
assume this population is in
[SPEAKER_00]: Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just calculated with this
information here, the frequency of Q and
[SPEAKER_00]: the frequency of P, starting with the
recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get to big B, big E, which is P
squared, we take our 0.6 and we square it
[SPEAKER_00]: to get 0.36.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our heterozygous, 2PQ.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our 2PQ.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 2 times 0.4 times 0.6 will give us the
0.48.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one here, our Q squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take our Q in this case, which is our
0.4, and we square it to get 0.16.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these added together should equal one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives you a little bit more of the
background of the math here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember Q is the 0.16 square root.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you the 0.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: P plus Q equals 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, P equals 1 minus Q,
which equals 1 minus 0.4, which equals
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it might get a little confusing
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to pause this at any time
and look back.
[SPEAKER_00]: P squared is our 0.6 squared to give us
0.36, which means 36 out of 100 tigers
[SPEAKER_00]: will be homozygous dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the heterozygous here,
which is the 0.6 times the 0.4 times 2 to
[SPEAKER_00]: give us the 0.48, which means 48 out of
the 100 tigers will be orange and
[SPEAKER_00]: heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, take your time, go back,
flip through this, and take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming Hardy-Weber equilibrium,
here's what we just calculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be considered the null
hypothesis, but now we take a look and we
[SPEAKER_00]: take some sample data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take some genetic screens of our
tigers, and we come up with these numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we explain this data?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, clearly the recessive ones match,
but there is a strong favoritism,
[SPEAKER_00]: for whatever reason, for the homozygous
dominant genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this may give these individuals a
particular advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus the heterozygous and still orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we take another population,
take a sample, we see here how to explain
[SPEAKER_00]: this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well clearly the heterozygotes now have a
clear advantage, because they're being
[SPEAKER_00]: selected for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's no phenotype difference,
but this could be an advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably just a little bit more data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, always welcome to pause the video
and take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This takes a look at allele frequencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at a number of individuals at
200, instead of just 100 here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, starting with the homozygous
recessive, because we know what that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can go through and calculate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the alleles contribute to a
gene pool of 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, our genes are 200, but our total
individuals are 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genes, because they're diploids,
are multiplied by two, in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the possible gametes, you can see,
again, follow this through.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go back and watch the previous
steps, that I went through, this follows
[SPEAKER_00]: the same exact thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to follow the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also have another video going through
another example, to help provide you with
[SPEAKER_00]: some experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know initially this is a little
confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watching this again, doing some examples,
as we will do in class, can definitely get
[SPEAKER_00]: you by that initial hurdle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think once you understand it,
it'll come easier to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this shows the same example,
a little graphical representation,
[SPEAKER_00]: adding in the Punnett square.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see where the p squared
comes from with the homozygous dominant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the q squared, which is the homozygous
recessive, and then the heterozygotes
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and how these alleles break apart,
and how they come up with the numbers that
[SPEAKER_00]: are calculated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last slide, just to go over in this
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at another example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, tying in the Punnett squares,
following the same equation of p squared
[SPEAKER_00]: plus two pq plus q squared equal one,
and using now a different number of
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals, so you can see how we
calculate the totals here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Individuals here is 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to convert our number of
individuals versus our total, based on
[SPEAKER_00]: 500, to get to our p's and our q's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, p plus q equals one.
[SPEAKER_00]: By using genotype frequencies,
along with the known number of individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: of allele frequencies can be calculated,
and using the allele frequencies here,
[SPEAKER_00]: predicted frequencies of homozygous
dominant and recessive, and heterozygotes
[SPEAKER_00]: can be calculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, we want to start with the
recessive, because we know what those are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we start with the phenotype here,
we don't know if we're dealing with the
[SPEAKER_00]: homozygous dominant or the heterozygotes,
but once we have the recessive,
[SPEAKER_00]: we know p plus q equals one, and from
there we can start to solve our equation
[SPEAKER_00]: and calculate the dominant phenotypes,
what the exact genotypes are for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you can watch this video again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I have another example video
you're welcome to check out to hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: get you through in understanding the
Hardy-Wein Verge equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
