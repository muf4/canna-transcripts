[SPEAKER_00]: Here in this Tabaco University video,
I'm going to go over how you would go
[SPEAKER_00]: about preparing for the arrival of
cannabis clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this image shows an outdoor
application, this can also apply to indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grows as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over how to prepare
for the arrival of cannabis clones that
[SPEAKER_00]: you might be receiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, you want to prepare for the
arrival of the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how do you go about doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not need to have a full
propagation environment the exact day of
[SPEAKER_00]: arrival, and planting day will likely not
be a perfect match, so there's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a slight difference here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, growers need to have an area
to be ready to receive the clones that is
[SPEAKER_00]: supportive for their growth, and at least
kind of easing that transition process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, while we're seeing some outdoor
preparations here, this also applies to
[SPEAKER_00]: someone who might be using clones for an
indoor operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the clones often arrived stressed,
so this is important factor to keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind, even the best companies that ship
them, or even if they come in and purchase
[SPEAKER_00]: them locally, they're going to be a little
stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You typically arrive on site with some
degree of stress, and that could be light
[SPEAKER_00]: stress, water stress, temperature,
or any combination of the above factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, growers need to create a kind of a
nursing environment to actually allow your
[SPEAKER_00]: newly arrived clones to adjust to an area
before they go to the main growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones are typically exposed to long hours
of darkness, so exposing plants to proper
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period is also important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we could see here these clones are
going to be prepared for an outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: operation, but they were put outside under
a tree in the very early morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell by that by this very sun
angle that we see there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not directly above them, just kind of
in the morning there, helping them adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: to that outside light, the natural
sunlight, but not blazing high noon bright
[SPEAKER_00]: sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal overall here, as we see,
is to keep the intensity initially a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit lower, but increase the plants
as they get accustomed to their new
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an indoor grow, that could be
putting shade netting up, or if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: dimmable option on your lights,
turning them down till they're dimmed so
[SPEAKER_00]: that your plants aren't getting that full
PAR reading, at least right when they get
[SPEAKER_00]: to your location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, your goal as a grower, if it's a pot
of arrival, your clones should try to
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilize the environment that the clones
are being exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to keep going through
constant changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you want to have it match the
conditions they will be experiencing at
[SPEAKER_00]: the vegetative cycle, you may have to work
the plants up to that level of stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that could be light stress,
water stress, temperature stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: all those above included.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to slowly get them to that
area that they're going to be spending
[SPEAKER_00]: their vegetative propagation portion of
their life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, depending on the duration,
depending on how long you need to stage or
[SPEAKER_00]: hold your clones before they reach their
final planting site will impact the care
[SPEAKER_00]: and attention that they will need.
[SPEAKER_00]: The longer the duration, the more careful
care and attention needs to be given,
[SPEAKER_00]: but keep in mind while you're giving that
care and attention or you're holding them,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep in mind you want to make sure that
you're having that environment represent
[SPEAKER_00]: where they're going to go to next.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have them go through a
massive change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to try to replicate that
environment as best that you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you're holding clones,
the goal is to keep them alive and
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy, but not really make them grow all
that much, particularly if they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors and you have to hold them indoors
for a period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to keep them alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to grow crazy or stretch or
cause any sorts of other issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers get their clones in,
they're excited, they have their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really want to push a lot of
growth because that can cause stress to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often they'll have a limited rooting
system and they're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanted, so they're going to get
disturbed again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just kind of want to hold them in
that nice, healthy state before they get
[SPEAKER_00]: to their final environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to push a bunch of growth and
think you're going to get a big head start
[SPEAKER_00]: before they transition to the last spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're holding clones for an
extended period of time, this is just an
[SPEAKER_00]: important note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your timing is a little bit off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be sure that when they're
being transferred to their final growing
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, you may need to transplant
the clones to allow the roots to expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that when you're looking
at that longer duration, if their timing
[SPEAKER_00]: is a little bit off, you may have to
up-pot them before they get transplanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this can be a time-consuming process,
so it's best really to time the delivery
[SPEAKER_00]: so you do not need to hold clones for an
extended period of time and up-pot them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in some cases you may need to do this
and it might be advantageous for you to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that if your timing isn't quite right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes the clones come in,
when the clones come in and you might have
[SPEAKER_00]: issues with your final site or preparation
time, this is a viable option to ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: when those clones do go out to their final
location, they're going to be in the best
[SPEAKER_00]: shape possible and hopefully produce the
best quality plants for the duration of
[SPEAKER_00]: the growing season for you.
