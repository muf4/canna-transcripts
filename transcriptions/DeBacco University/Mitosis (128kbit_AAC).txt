[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, as the title suggests,
I'm going to go over mitosis, but I'm also
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be mentioning interphase and
cytokinesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good summary slide provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple more of those will occur
throughout the video presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with mitosis, it is involved
with cell replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cells making more identical copies of
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And identical is the key word here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're not having identical copies,
we have mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good thing if it's simply like a copy
machine, we want to produce as close to
[SPEAKER_00]: the original as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we can ensure the same functions
of our cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cell cycle are two main components,
interphase and mitosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mitosis is actually the process of cell
division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interphase though is a little,
slightly different phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are subdivisions of interphase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those being the G0, which is just a
resting phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: G1 is the growth in metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: S is DNA representation.
[SPEAKER_00]: G2 is replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: G2 is growth of structural elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And M is actually the mitosis phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives a little bit of approximation
of time to give you an idea of the
[SPEAKER_00]: eukaryotic replication cycle that does
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitosis here, broken into these phases,
like prophase, prometaphase, metaphase,
[SPEAKER_00]: anaphase, telekinesis, and then
cytokinesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interphase here is that G2 phase is
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the interphase is the stage where
living cells are when they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: dividing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's indicated by chromosomes not being
visible with a light microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is our interphase with a gray region
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitosis is occurring in this darker
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see again those terms,
G1, S, and G2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interphase is, G1 is referring to when the
cell increases in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: S is again that DNA replication portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And G2 is the mitochondria and other
organelles begin to divide before the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: actually enters officially mitosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here mitosis is basically cell
division.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's four main steps, plus the last
step of cytokinesis kind of broken out and
[SPEAKER_00]: different than the four main steps of
mitosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It occurs in the marrow stems,
which are stem tips, where there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of actively dividing cells, and then root
tips, where there's a lot of actively
[SPEAKER_00]: dividing cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can occur at other parts throughout the
plant, but these are areas where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to find a high rate of cell
division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with prophase, chromosomes form
into chromatids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our chromosomes forming into
our sister chromatids, where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: replication phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going into mitosis,
where we're basically separating those out
[SPEAKER_00]: to form two identical cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows a little bit of an example here
where our sister chromatids are located in
[SPEAKER_00]: the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prophase chromatin condensates into
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nucleolus disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nuclear envelope fragments and
nucleolus disintegrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, the nucleolus from our
organelles is where the rRNA is made.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at that nuclear envelope
beginning to fragment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chromatids are condensing, making them
more visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prophase are polar microtubules,
shown in green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of in this image here are strands
that established a matrix around the
[SPEAKER_00]: currently intact nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will fragment, but right now it's still
intact, but we're seeing this webbing
[SPEAKER_00]: being starting to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The condensing chromosomes are in blue
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red dots, kind of pinkish dots we see
here, are the central mirrors,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's involved with DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prometaphase is kind of in between
prophase and metaphase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our spindle fibers anchoring at
the poles, those here and here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nuclear membrane fully breaks down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our kinetochore microtubules invade
the nuclear space.
[SPEAKER_00]: These kinetochores are now starting to
attach to the chromosomes and are starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to get some level of organization now that
the nucleus is broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a little bit of a change here in
prometaphase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nuclear membrane has just basically
broken apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microtubules quickly interact with the
kinetochores, which assemble the central
[SPEAKER_00]: mirrors to condense chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because our nucleus is breaking
apart, we now need these fibers to grab
[SPEAKER_00]: onto these chromosomes to be able to hold
onto them and get them in alignment as
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going through the process of cell
division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metaphase here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chromosomes line up along the metaphase
plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we call the metaphase plate,
lining up on the equator that we have on
[SPEAKER_00]: the globe here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, this is an imaginary plane,
both on the globe and also in the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no true plate that they're all
kind of lining up and pressing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just lining up in that middle,
and it's an imaginary kind of line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they do form this line, just like the
equator on the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metaphase spindle fibers attach to the
central mirrors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This right here, our central mirrors,
that red region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of where these two join
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a point of attachment that
will then allow these two to then be
[SPEAKER_00]: separated in broken part to form the two
identical cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of see that forming here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Menofluorescence microscope will tip this
image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our central mirrors have moved to the
poles of the cell and have established a
[SPEAKER_00]: metatic spindle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chromosomes have condensed on the
metaphase plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of see a little bit of a line up
here in that central imaginary region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anaphase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the shortest time to complete of
all the phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: The central mirrors are broken apart into
sister chromatids and to daughter
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we see that we're all initially
lined up on the plate and now they're
[SPEAKER_00]: being broken apart and pulled to the poles
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens in unison.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see they're all kind of in
alignment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens in the least amount of time as
any of the phases of mitosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anaphase, the chromosomes break at the
central mirrors and sister chromatids move
[SPEAKER_00]: to opposite ends of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, those daughter chromosomes are then
moving towards the poles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, this is all happening basically
at the same time in unison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anaphase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of get the idea of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our kinetochores microtubules are pulling
the two sets towards the poles here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is creating two halves of the
dividing cell further apart while the
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes are condensed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see those central mirrors here,
those little red regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Telophase and cytokinesis is where the
nuclear membrane reforms and re-appear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chromosomes unwind into chromatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myosin-1 and actin filament rings contract
to cleave the cell into two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cleavage fur is in that contracting
ring is where the cell is basically
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to kind of pinch or it's
ultimately going to break apart there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Telophase is reversal of prophase and
probatophase events, thus completing the
[SPEAKER_00]: cell cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that here we're now even
visually seeing basically two separate and
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: That mitosis phase, give you again that
kind of refresher of what interphase is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the DNA is very hard to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're condensing it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nuclear envelope is starting to kind
of break down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metaphase is very distinctive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything lined up on the plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anaphase, very quick timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're separating out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here in telophase we're starting to
get that cleavage fur.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting to get that pinch point in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Action path because there's five main
events occurring at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: During telophase, so while I like to
simplify it here, there are actually five
[SPEAKER_00]: things going on during this one phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The daughter chromosomes are becoming
surrounded by a nuclear envelope.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that here we're starting to form that
protective nucleus over the DNA structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, during telophase daughter
chromosomes become longer and thinner and
[SPEAKER_00]: become invisible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They become invisible because they're
becoming from a condensed state to a very
[SPEAKER_00]: relaxed state.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why they're getting into that
relaxed state is it makes it easier for
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA replication of certain genes that may
be needed by the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: If everything was all condensed and packed
together, it'd be really hard to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it becomes invisible because
it's becoming thinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's becoming more single stranded than it
is a dense coil.
[SPEAKER_00]: During telophase also, nucleoli become
visible again.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little hard to see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the kind of the nucleus within the
nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's typically that little darker
region, very evident in this cell here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, many of the spindle fibers begin to
break apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were needed for separating out the
chromosomes here, but they're starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: disintegrate and basically fall apart
because they're no longer needed at this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, if we're talking about plant
cells, the cell plate will form.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is only for a plant cell because they
have a cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting into that cell plate with
that cell wall that's forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what it looks like in a
real life cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the cell plate and that's
ultimately going to join up here and form
[SPEAKER_00]: a cell wall between these two newly formed
identical cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cytokinesis is the actual separation to
two independent cells here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the very end of the mitotic phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually considered its own
separate phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when the two cells actually are
separating out completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very simple summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you can follow along with
this here with some of what's going on at
[SPEAKER_00]: the different phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interphase, early prophase, late prophase,
metaphase is very distinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of with them all being lined up
on the plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then anaphase we have here,
and then telophase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be followed by cytokinesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for a wonderful summary
slide of everything, this is the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: process here with nice bullet points for
each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also gives a wonderful images of the cell,
how it looks with the stain and dye here
[SPEAKER_00]: of the immunofluorescence microscope to
get you an idea of how it looks on a
[SPEAKER_00]: cartoon image showing the things in
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gives you those descriptions and then the
real world image with the bar here
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating the same size for each.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great slide to review for test or
quizzes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another review slide, the cell cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it specifically points out animal
cells because it won't have that cell
[SPEAKER_00]: plate forming in cytokinesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just another way to kind of review and
make sure you're understanding and knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a slide here showing cells actively
growing in a root tip where there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of mitosis going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could easily point to one of these and
you should be able to identify what stages
[SPEAKER_00]: it is based on visual observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go through some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember in the description there is a
link to all these slides and you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to pause them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to run through these slides here
and go over the answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then to the second one which is pointing
to two different cells here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third one again two different cells
and again this is in a plant cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fourth one, what phase of mitosis are
these two in?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to pause and go back or
look at the description for the links to
[SPEAKER_00]: the slides you can look at those more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we get to the answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one was metaphase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again they're all kind of lined up on that
plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: May not be 100% perfect but we do see a
distinctive line form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interphase and anaphase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here they're not lined up on the plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting pulled apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interphase we see the distinct nucleus
and nucleolus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prophase we're starting to see that
condensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anaphase again being pulled apart a
little bit more distant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Telophase we're seeing that cell plate
kind of starting to form a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two cells almost complete with their
division process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in prophase here we're seeing the DNA
being condensed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Link to some videos that might be helpful
in looking at the descriptions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're also welcome to go back and
review the slides here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
