[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at some
nervous system basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we see in this image, some of the
major nerves are labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we probably most of them are with the
brain in the spinal cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about the nervous system,
there's also some major nerves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see an ulnar nerve corresponds
with the ulnar, which is going back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: skeletal system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the terms and names
interconnect here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as a brain teacher, since we are
talking about the nervous system,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to look at this image.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to try to say the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, the first one here,
the word would be yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because it's in green color,
we would want to say the color,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be green.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one would be yellow, then red,
then black, then green, and then blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially it might be a little
difficult because your right brain is
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to say the color, but your left
brain is trying to read the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want something interesting,
if you have a young individual,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can pause the video and have them do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically they do it very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do it much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The younger someone is, technically the
better they are because they're not really
[SPEAKER_00]: able to read the words.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to recognize the colors,
and they can pick them out and do this at
[SPEAKER_00]: a very fast rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the evolutionary path to vertebrate
nervous system is being the most complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our Niderians have simple nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, those are, for example,
like our jellyfish.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have this kind of nerve net that's
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have no associated activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just have reflexes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very basic nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then our flatworms are first to kind of
associate activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have two nerve cords that run
down their bodies, and they permit complex
[SPEAKER_00]: control of muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more complex vertebrates here are more
sophisticated sensory mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Differentiation into central and
peripheral nervous systems, as I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: discuss in other videos, and the
differentiation of sensory and motor
[SPEAKER_00]: nerves, which I'll describe here briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this does is this allows reaction to
occur based on stimuli.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this elaborative brain activity is
reacting to the environment that the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual is living in and allowing it to
better control its own system so that it
[SPEAKER_00]: can be most efficient in the system's
living.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're looking at here is an aspect
of controlling and communicating systems
[SPEAKER_00]: of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have sensory input.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where stimuli is occurring inside
and outside the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of receiving that signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then our brain, for example, is
integrating that or interpreting that
[SPEAKER_00]: sensory input.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically saying, OK, here's just an
impulse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it hot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it cold?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it pain?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's going to result in motor
output.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's our response to the stimuli.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're having the hand basically go
through and curl up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a response to stimuli by
activating effector organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a response here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first the body is interpreting that
signal, that sensory input, integrating
[SPEAKER_00]: that, making sense of what's going on,
and then resulting in a motor output.
[SPEAKER_00]: How that looks here is we have our
sensory.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part with the sensory is we're
receiving signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, we have sensors in the
skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sensory system is sending that
information to the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the brain here is going through and
sending a signal to a muscle that could
[SPEAKER_00]: cause it to contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be a prime example of if the
water is hot and the brain is sensing that
[SPEAKER_00]: hot water, it's interpreting that signal,
I should move my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to send a motor signal
here to the muscles that it contract or
[SPEAKER_00]: pull that hand away from that area of
danger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Functions of the nervous system,
just some two basic ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: First is the control center for all body
activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, here's our central and peripheral
nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So control center for all of our
activities is a great summary of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, the second function of the
nervous system is to respond and adapt to
[SPEAKER_00]: changes that occur both inside as well as
outside the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: This relates to pain, temperature,
pregnancy, any host of things that the
[SPEAKER_00]: body is responding to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the key part is with our nervous
system, it's a way of not only
[SPEAKER_00]: interpreting signals that are coming from
both inside and outside the body,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's also allowing the body to react
to those changes to keep it out of
[SPEAKER_00]: potential dangers and to be best fit for
the environment that it lives in.
