[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to look at roundworms
or nematodes, and we see two pictured
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get into a little more
detail of what defines these as animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting in general, the evolution of a
body cavity is one distinguishing factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I show some human examples here to
help reiterate the point, but remember we
[SPEAKER_00]: are talking about nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This body cavity is a key evolutionary
step.
[SPEAKER_00]: This body cavity helps improve animal body
design in three main areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Circulation, for one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Movement, for another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, organ function, how organs are
able to be able to perform at a very high
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helps through the aid of a
circulatory system, which can improve an
[SPEAKER_00]: animal's overall movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now roundworms and that body cavity,
if you've been watching these videos in
[SPEAKER_00]: order, talked about initially,
you may remember, acelomates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no body cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are our flatworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're progressing up now to our
pseudocelomates that have a body cavity
[SPEAKER_00]: located between the mesoderm and the
endoderm.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are our nematodes or nematodes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to continue with other videos
here and other sections, acelomates,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they have a body cavity that develops
entirely within the mesoderm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are kind of a great picture here
with some similar colorations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows you to compare and see some
similarities, as well as some differences
[SPEAKER_00]: between these different animals here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we're talking about
pseudocelomates here with our roundworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within the acelomate phylum,
we have nematodes or nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the largest kind of number of
species within this phylum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are unsegmented, as we can see
here, cylindrical worms covered by a
[SPEAKER_00]: flexible cuticle that is molted as they
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're animals that molt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can live in different environments,
particularly soil environments or within
[SPEAKER_00]: plants also.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be more familiar with these than
you actually realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, if you're familiar with them,
you might be familiar with them in a bad
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some nematodes are parasitic in humans,
cats, dogs, and animals, and this is why
[SPEAKER_00]: they're of economic importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heartworm and dog is caused by nematodes,
as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all those kind of parasites
living inside there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichinosis here is an infection caused by
nematodes and is transmitted to humans who
[SPEAKER_00]: eat undercooked pork.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of one kind of living
inside this muscle tissue here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have a dog if I give him some
pills to forego heartworm, and you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid this at all costs here, and this is
caused by parasitic nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to think all of these are
bad because there are some beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's actually beneficial versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be used to specifically attack
pests such as grubs that live in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be difficult to control
otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you know anyone who's trying to have
a healthy lawn and get rid of grubs,
[SPEAKER_00]: they may apply pesticides, so those
pesticides can kill other insects,
[SPEAKER_00]: can reduce the earthworm population,
and just be negative for the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, adding beneficial nematodes here,
and there's different strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: what they do is they seek out and they
feed on, they parasitize these grubs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they multiply with inside the grub,
and when the population gets really high,
[SPEAKER_00]: not only does the grub die, but we see all
of these other individuals released,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they can go out and find other grubs,
and they can kind of do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could take a grass region that
would look like this, very chopped up
[SPEAKER_00]: because these grubs are eating all their
roots and destroying the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ideally, a nice green fairway or lawn
here purely through the product of these
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes going through and finding and
eating out all of the grubs so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have any issues with them
mass-multiplying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the beneficial nematodes go
through the process of degrading the grub
[SPEAKER_00]: and eating the inside and spread through
and help correct the problem without any
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
