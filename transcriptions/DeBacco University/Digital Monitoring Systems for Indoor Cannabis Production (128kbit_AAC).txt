[SPEAKER_00]: In this Debaco University video,
I'm going to go over digital monitoring
[SPEAKER_00]: systems for indoor cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the details of
digital monitoring for environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions in a cannabis production
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the advantages of digital
monitoring systems is that they're often
[SPEAKER_00]: offer very precise readouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be preset with minimum and
maximum levels for alarms that can alert
[SPEAKER_00]: the grower when something gets out of the
intended target range.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also very easy to read,
which makes it great for people that have
[SPEAKER_00]: to go through and document if there's
multiple shifts of people coming through a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Digital precision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the advantage, again,
of these digital systems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these digital readouts provide
precise readouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be important when small details
can cause an impact on the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also offer the advance of having
multiple sensors in the same area to help
[SPEAKER_00]: gain an idea of the potential microclimate
that may exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have multiple sensors all feeding
into one computer, all one data logger,
[SPEAKER_00]: able then to see what's the temperature
closer to the container level,
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the plants, above the lights,
below the lights, near the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can allow for a great accumulation of
information and very precise information
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Digital monitoring systems can also
self-monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that they're able to go
through and it can be preset to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: more of a hands-off approach to help
ensure that when conditions get out of
[SPEAKER_00]: range, an immediate reaction can take
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a temperature gets too high,
it can immediately kick on a potential
[SPEAKER_00]: alarm or potential sensor or a fan as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also apply to making preset
adjustments at certain times or given
[SPEAKER_00]: certain conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can help, again, create the more
ideal environment for those plants more
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently over a longer period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those digital readouts, again,
in operations that have multiple workers,
[SPEAKER_00]: digital readouts can be preferred simply
because there is no interpretation needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the humidity when you walked in?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the last 24 hours, min and max,
as we can see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It offers it very precisely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no trying to read where is the
line compared to the dial, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, despite the advantages that the
digital systems offer, many of our workers
[SPEAKER_00]: invest in a full digital system but may
also have some analog monitors to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: a backup just in case something was to go
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if the batteries die?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if they lose power?
[SPEAKER_00]: Having an analog system is usually
provided by a lot of growers as a simple
[SPEAKER_00]: backup to their digital systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, where digital systems should be
used or higher priorities for digital
[SPEAKER_00]: systems would be pH because a tenth of a
point can make a large difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon dioxide enrichment, as we can see
here, making sure we're getting to the
[SPEAKER_00]: right parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then light levels to power reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where digital sensors can be used but are
a little less to a degree are temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're generally close,
that might be good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you can see here, some of the
sensors that are also doing some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: other things also can log temperature as
well as relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good, again, more data can be a good
thing here to log that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly though, just to keep in mind that
no matter what system you're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: a sensor is only as good as its placement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an additional video here on
Tobacco University to go over where to
[SPEAKER_00]: place sensors and that's very important to
ensure the reading you're getting is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be representative of the growing
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for watching and I'll see you
next time.
