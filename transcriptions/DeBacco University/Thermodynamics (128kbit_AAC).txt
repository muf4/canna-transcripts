[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're looking at a basic
overview of thermodynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This picture gives you a real quick
summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having a system and its
surroundings, which are separated by a
[SPEAKER_00]: boundary.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little more specifically here,
the definition is the study of the flow
[SPEAKER_00]: and transformation of energy in the
universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thermodynamics directly translates to heat
changes and is only concerned with
[SPEAKER_00]: large-scale observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first law of thermodynamics is the
law of conservation of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It states that energy can be converted but
not created nor destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The example would that be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our food energy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy stored in the food and our chemical
energy that we eat is converted or
[SPEAKER_00]: transformed into mechanical energy when we
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since energy cannot be created or
destroyed, it can only be converted.
[SPEAKER_00]: The total energy before in the food items
is equal to the total energy after,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though a transformation occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first law of thermodynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second law of thermodynamics states
that energy cannot be converted without
[SPEAKER_00]: the loss of usable energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy lost, and I put that in quotes
here, is converted to thermal energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see our energy before in this kind
of box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our usable energy after is a smaller
portion, even though if we add up the
[SPEAKER_00]: usable energy after and the unusable
energy after, we get the same amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this unusable energy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this unusable energy can be that
thermal energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we take a ball and we bounce it in
the same area again and again and again,
[SPEAKER_00]: the area where it keeps bouncing will be
warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a transfer of thermal energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That energy is what we call lost,
in the sense that we're not able ourselves
[SPEAKER_00]: to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we still account for that energy,
and it's still accounted for, so the total
[SPEAKER_00]: energy before is the same as the energy
after.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we have to account for some
amount of energy that is considered
[SPEAKER_00]: unusable, and that typically is lost in
the form of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we add up that heat energy
plus our usable energy, we will get the
[SPEAKER_00]: same amount, because again, we cannot
create or destroy energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that's a good quick overview of
thermodynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
