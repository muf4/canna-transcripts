[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at linkage maps
in relation to genes located on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go through an example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, this should make basic
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at a linkage map, it estimates the
distance between genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: More closely linked genes will be closer
together, and less closely linked genes
[SPEAKER_00]: will be further apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at a linkage map to try
to determine the location of certain genes
[SPEAKER_00]: in relation to one another, and how close
or how far they may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as an example, how can linkage maps be
made from observations of traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, our recombination frequencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The introduced gene terms, given gene X,
gene Y, and gene Z, gene X and gene Y
[SPEAKER_00]: recombinate about 8% of the time,
meaning they're about 8 units away from
[SPEAKER_00]: one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: X and Z, though, are 12%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our X.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're wondering at 12% whether the Z is 12
units away to the left, or from X,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 units away to the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a kind of quandary here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at, we know it's 12% recombination
frequency, so it's 12 base pairs away,
[SPEAKER_00]: or 12 units away, I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not sure though if it's going to
go basically 12 units this way,
[SPEAKER_00]: or 12 units the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need some more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing that Y and Z are 4%, so Z is 4
units away from Y, we then can make the
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusion that Z is over in this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So see, initially here, without this
information, we know here where X is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know Z is 12 units away, but we don't
know if it's to the left or right,
[SPEAKER_00]: though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by getting that information that it is
also 4 units away from Y, 8 plus 4 is 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's our X.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's our Y, and that's where our Z
would be located.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this information, we're able to
eliminate the possibility that Z is
[SPEAKER_00]: located over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at another example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crossover frequencies can be converted
into, again, these map units that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take, for example, a 5% crossover
frequency equals 5 map units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems easy enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene A and gene B cross over 6% of the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many map units would that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: 6 map units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene B and gene C cross over 12.5% of the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can convert that to 12.5 map units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene A and gene C, so taking information
from here and here, cross over 18.5% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this being 6 map units away,
this being 12.5 map units away,
[SPEAKER_00]: 6 plus 12.5 would give us the 18.5
indicating A to B, and then C is located
[SPEAKER_00]: over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see, because this follows
everything here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A and B, 6 units away, yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: B and C are 12 units away, indicating that
A to C is 18.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it simply go A, B, C.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll always be the case, but hopefully
you can kind of follow and understand how
[SPEAKER_00]: we got to the order and the distance
between these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, once you get the hang of it,
it's actually pretty easy to go over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's check here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on the above linkage map,
when located here, what's the frequency of
[SPEAKER_00]: gene A and gene B crossing over together,
or gene D and gene C?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also draw a linkage map based on
the following crossover percentages for
[SPEAKER_00]: the three gene pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If A and B is 8%, B and C is 10%,
A and C is 2%, what would that physically
[SPEAKER_00]: look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can get the first one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on the above linkage map,
or if you go here, you can pause it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to give you the answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the first one here, based on the
above linkage map, this case would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: below linkage map, what are the
frequencies of A and B crossing over?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's A, here's B, 40% minus 25% would
give you the distance here, that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: 15%, and then D to C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's D and C, we want to figure out
what this distance is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take A and D, we subtract A to C,
25% minus 30%, this distance is 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please realize that this map may not be
drawn to scale, but by simply calculating
[SPEAKER_00]: these figures out, you can tell this
distance, based on the map, is 5%,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the distance between B and A,
or A and B here, would be 15%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other part of that question,
draw a linkage map based on the following
[SPEAKER_00]: crossover percentages.
[SPEAKER_00]: If A and B is 8%, and B and C is 10%,
A and C is 2%, we want to know what order
[SPEAKER_00]: these are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I start with just drawing simple two
ends, I connect them together,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I start to label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go with the first information
you've got here, and A to B would be 8%,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's the longer distance here.
[SPEAKER_00]: B to C would be 10%, so B and C is 10%,
A and C is 2%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that C is located here,
not over here, because 8 plus 2 would give
[SPEAKER_00]: us that 10%, the distance between B and B.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know initially this might sound a
little confusing, and it does take a
[SPEAKER_00]: little guess and check, there's no quick,
easy way to determine that, but if you
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the numbers, and put one down one
place, and start with a known,
[SPEAKER_00]: we know A and B is 8 units away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, now we've got to go to the next
one, B and C is 10 units, we don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: that's to the left or the right,
but with A and C only being 2 units away,
[SPEAKER_00]: 8 plus 2 is 10, and that perfectly solves
our linkage map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully if you review these a little
bit, they'll start to make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially I know it's a little bit foreign
to look at, but hopefully reviewing it a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple times will make it quick and easy,
and it makes for a great quiz question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
