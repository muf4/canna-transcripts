[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another DeBacco University
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video lecture, we're going to be
learning about identifying cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_00]: anatomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some you might be familiar with,
like the picture here of this nice female
[SPEAKER_00]: bud, but we're going to get into some of
the other details that you might have seen
[SPEAKER_00]: before, but maybe not familiar with their
actual terminology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, if you want to learn a
little bit more, I have this link to this
[SPEAKER_00]: reference article here and cited here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will use some aspects of it in this
presentation, but there's even more detail
[SPEAKER_00]: provided there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I want to talk about rooted
cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now rooted cuttings are a simple form of
vegetative propagation, and we see the
[SPEAKER_00]: example here, exhibit A, with the rooted
cutting about two weeks after rooting,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this bar represents 10 centimeters for
a size orientation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now other cuttings, they don't all have to
look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example here of some other
rooted cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these are vegetative propagation,
meaning these are what a lot of growers
[SPEAKER_00]: refer to as clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are genetic copies of the mother or
stock plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to carry on those same terpene
profiles, those same cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: as the mother plant, and it's a great way
to ensure genetic consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also have the internode of the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of terms here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the shoot that kind of comes out
to the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the axillary shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two bracts, and there's kind of the areas
that kind of like little branch out,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have two solitary flowers in this
image.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a solitary flower here on the
right-hand side and another one here on
[SPEAKER_00]: the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all located at the node here where
the axle leaf kind of comes in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kind of the petiole of the leaf enters
at the node here, and this would
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately kind of lead to one of the true
or fan leaves here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in this image, the bar represents
about two-tenths of a centimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you another orientation,
another picture showing the same general
[SPEAKER_00]: area, we can see a lot of the same anatomy
features located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind the distance between two
nodes is called the internode space.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plant stretches, the spacing of
the internodes increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to the cotyledons,
and these are the embryonic or seed
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, which are the first two leaves to
appear from a germinating seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be more rounder in
appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see them clearly evident here,
and it's kind of a nice little way to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of see that little seedling come up,
and that seedling can kind of go through
[SPEAKER_00]: and be those first leaves to start
capturing the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can start to go through the full
synthetic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can start growing exponentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now after those cotyledons or seed leaves
go by, we get into a culture of true
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now true leaves, here's our two seed
leaves or cotyledons, these would be our
[SPEAKER_00]: next two leaves, these would be our true
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And true leaves are basically any leaves
of a seed plant other than the cotyledons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these third and fourth leaves right
here, and everything after that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: considered true leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when they get older, they kind of look
like this, and higher up in the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of growers will refer to them as fan
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a further classification of true
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into sugar leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: These leaves kind of grow out of the bud
and have many trichomes on them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's the trichomes that give the
appearance of the sugar on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've kind of cooked something and put
powdered sugar on it, it kind of looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like that same appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why they get the term sugar
leaves, is it looks like you've kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: took that powdered sugar and lightly
coated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're actually looking at there is a
series, a density of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get male and female preflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the male flowers, they produce the
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see those right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to look for these kind of
pronounced sac-like flower structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: In comparison, the female preflowers
located right below me here, these will
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately produce the cannabinoids and or
seeds if they get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to look for these fine little
wispy white hairs called the stigmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you want to hear the term stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of sticky stigmas, which might
always look like even finer hairs on them,
[SPEAKER_00]: is this structure would be responsible for
capturing pollen for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get something called popcorn buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now popcorn buds get their name simply
because they're similar size to a popcorn
[SPEAKER_00]: kernel.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are B-grade buds due to the overall
size of those buds and the potency will be
[SPEAKER_00]: similar, though slightly lower than
A-grade buds produced on the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're often offered at a reduced price
if you're looking at purchasing them due
[SPEAKER_00]: to their lack of visual impact compared to
those large A-grade buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are getting the maximum amount of
light and have the maximum amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and cannabinoids in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get those trichomes that I
mentioned a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see kind of a focus on them and
they are hair-like outgrowths that are the
[SPEAKER_00]: site of cannabinoid, terpene, and
flavonoid production.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of zoomed-out look kind of see
how they get the term those sugar leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: coated with those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you zoom a little bit closer,
closer, and closer, you can see they're
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like clear to whitish
mushroom-like structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is where you're going to
find your cannabinoids and terpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be kind of condensed in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to store them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a calyx structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is found in all flowering plants and
it's the first part of the flower that
[SPEAKER_00]: forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's composed of a collection of small
leaves called sepals that form near where
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower meets the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that evident right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides stability to the flower and
creates protective structure for the
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductive organs of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we go back to the stigma here,
kind of looking a little bit more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: zoomed-in, kind of a stereoscope image of
developing female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see those stigmas here on a
premature stigma here just starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of develop and come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a fully mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it much larger and even like
small little fine hairs because remember,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is a plant, again, responsible for
capturing the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit more macroscopic scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here kind of those stigmas
there that are produced, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: at high concentrations in those female
flowers because they're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible as the plants try to do that
to increase the odds that it will
[SPEAKER_00]: intercept pollen floating in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the early female preflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this estipule here,
that calyx that I mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this image located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the pistol here, which
includes the stigma and then the estipule
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a small leaf-like appendage of
a leaf, typically born in pairs at the
[SPEAKER_00]: base of a leaf stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it might be something you see in
pairs, again, looking at that node region
[SPEAKER_00]: of a particular plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the apical portion of the main shoot,
the apical part of the shoot, here is five
[SPEAKER_00]: days after transition to a short
photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that here in the can,
this bar represents half a centimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This apical area, this shortly after a
short photoperiod is going to induce
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see here that this plant is
female because we notice the induction of
[SPEAKER_00]: female flowers being produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, we have the shoot apex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of image D and E here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about 11 to 12 days of growth
under short photoperiod, inducing that
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that apex phase determined by the
first day of visible inflorescence,
[SPEAKER_00]: that first day of the visible flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: These bars represent half a centimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking here, again, that apex,
that region here, particularly that top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, is going to be where a lot of
cell division occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a meristematic region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be our site of that
flower production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this provided with some
details about general cannabis anatomy of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
