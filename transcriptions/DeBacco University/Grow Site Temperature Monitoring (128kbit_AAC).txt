[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to be looking at grow
site temperature monitoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of different systems out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes after home systems, we're
monitoring many conditions at once through
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe smart devices or other kind of
wireless systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just kind of give you an idea
of monitoring your grow site and
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature in particular are also very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, depending on the size of your grow
operation, you may want to consider
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple thermometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: For large operations, it's recommended
that you install multiple what's called
[SPEAKER_00]: min-max thermometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tell you basically over time the
minimum temperature and the maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature that your area has
experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this simply you could see here shows
you the maximum when it pushes up and the
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very efficient and quick read and
you push this button and it resets itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was why I say you may want to install
multiples depending on the size of your
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to put one near the ceiling
in the plant canopy and near the floor to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you a better idea what's actually
going on in the grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the most important one,
of course, is the one near the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're seeing something odd going
on there, sometimes you might want to
[SPEAKER_00]: install some other ones just to get an
idea of what might be going on above or
[SPEAKER_00]: even below the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the advanced system to install what's
called a data logger.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can help track multiple conditions at
regular intervals to help you make
[SPEAKER_00]: informed decisions and also double check
to make sure everything is working
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one example of a field one on the
outside near a grape field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is monitoring a whole host of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be wind direction, wind speed,
rainfall, temperature, amount of sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there can be a lot of things you can
look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes some very small ones here to
monitor temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sky's the limit on what you want to
monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind that the more conditions
you can monitor, the more odds you are to
[SPEAKER_00]: have control over what you can yield from
year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The better idea you have on what went
right or what went wrong, the better idea
[SPEAKER_00]: it can give you to make modifications
going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's thermostats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at that grow room,
that grow area.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something called single stages and
double stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Single stage are set for either heating or
cooling when temperature goes above or
[SPEAKER_00]: below a certain setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're called single stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you hit that temperature,
it'll turn on either the exhaust fan if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's getting too warm or it could turn on
the heater if it's getting too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: A double stage is a single unit that has
two temperatures to help you maintain the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature within a very specific range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if it hits one
temperature, it can turn a fan on,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when the temperature's getting too
hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or when it's getting too cold,
it can turn on a heater all within a
[SPEAKER_00]: single unit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's called double stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of has an upper, a maximum,
and a minimum fan there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The single stage will just be one
temperature and one result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thermostat placement is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where you select to physically place
your thermostat is critical for its
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to function properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to consider the vertical location
and also the sun or light exposure that
[SPEAKER_00]: you may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind hot air rises and cold air
sinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where you mount that thermostat will
create an effect when your exhaust fan may
[SPEAKER_00]: come on or also may affect when your
heater comes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind of where you actually
place that should be very representative
[SPEAKER_00]: of your grill facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now choosing between digital or analog
units, that can be debated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Digitals allow for an exact control but
can have a higher failure rate in part due
[SPEAKER_00]: to the high humidity that these are
typically placed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's an area where it's going to be
a lot of irrigation, a lot of humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: those have a higher tendency of failing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Analogs may have some more play in them
exactly as far as what the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature may be, but often can be more
reliable and more robust, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: grill facilities where you're dealing with
a lot of humidity and a lot of chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: water splash and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, they both can ideally do the
same job.
[SPEAKER_00]: The digital can give you some more
controls but could have a chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mechanical ones might have a little
bit more play in them, but once you get
[SPEAKER_00]: them dialed in, can be a little bit more
robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
