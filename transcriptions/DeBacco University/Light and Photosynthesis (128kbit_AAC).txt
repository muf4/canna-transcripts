[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be looking at light
and its impact on photosynthesis in a
[SPEAKER_00]: brief manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you ever look at a leaf really
close and kind of add some light to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see the intense network that's
occurring in that leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of exchange is going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of water can be moved through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients are being produced and shuffled
across.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugars are being transported.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on in the leaf that
you may not realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those leaves contain plant pigments
and plants contain pigments that target
[SPEAKER_00]: specific wavelengths of light to absorb.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows for multiple wavelengths to be
utilized by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though we typically associate a
leaf being completely green, there are
[SPEAKER_00]: other pigments that do exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, chlorophylls, the most dominant,
can overshadow and allow us not to see
[SPEAKER_00]: these other pigments.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in the case of New England,
where leaves will fall off the trees,
[SPEAKER_00]: its chlorophyll will be broken down and we
can start to see different colorations
[SPEAKER_00]: develop as those pigments become more
prominent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're always in the leaf,
but because chlorophyll is so dominant,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't get to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of that example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the chlorophyll being pulled
out of the leaf margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see nice brilliant oranges and reds
and some yellows being the next most
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant pigment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now chlorophyll, while we're using this as
a general term, there's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll A and chlorophyll B.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why a plant has those is they
absorb different wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see both chlorophyll A and B are
pretty poor at absorbing green
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of what makes plants green.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that light being reflected.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, blue and red wavelengths are
being absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice chlorophyll B and A have this
spike here in that blue wavelength,
[SPEAKER_00]: with chlorophyll B being a little bit more
absorbent of those kind of upper 400
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometer wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the contrast here with chlorophyll
A being a little bit better to absorb
[SPEAKER_00]: those mid to upper 600 nanometer
wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what helps the plant utilize and
capture more of the light that it's being
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: To help it even further along,
not going into this in too much detail,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's something called an antenna
complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: When light energy is absorbed by this
antenna pigment molecules, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred ultimately to chlorophyll A,
reaching the center pigment to drive
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's chlorophyll A.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can notice this energy transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might be familiar with lycopene and
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because it's kind of the red color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see chlorophyll B absorbing at 650
nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's chlorophyll B also absorbing at 450
nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Xanthocyanin is 480.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see this is the way that the
plant's able to capture greater amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: the light energy and transfer that energy
to chlorophyll A to then continue on with
[SPEAKER_00]: the photosynthetic process by utilizing as
much energy as possible that it's being
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to.
So here's chlorophyll A absorbing at 450
nanometers.
