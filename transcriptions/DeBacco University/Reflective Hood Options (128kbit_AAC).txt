[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I feel is often overlooked
by growers is the reflective hood options
[SPEAKER_00]: or just reflective hoods in general for
their artificial lighting setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here a double-ended,
here we have two 315 watt lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: and here we have a single-ended light,
all with slightly different reflectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the whole goal is the same,
to help increase the amount of light it
[SPEAKER_00]: hits the plants and is not lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these reflective hoods, and this is a
single-ended one here, the main goal is to
[SPEAKER_00]: disperse light evenly across the plant
canopy and minimize that light loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: A proper reflector can increase the
growing footprint under the same light
[SPEAKER_00]: compared if there was no reflector
utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only about 40% of the light goes directly
from the bulb to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without a reflector, about 60% would
be, quote, lost, and that sense of loss
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't be hitting the plant,
wouldn't be captured by the plant for the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's commonly made from thin metal,
so be careful not to damage them,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when you're taking the light or
the reflector out of the initial
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when you're looking at a reflector,
you want to look for the stated percent
[SPEAKER_00]: reflectivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reflectors leave the industry,
I've got three here, one's by Gavita,
[SPEAKER_00]: one's by Sunlight Supply, and one's by
Dimalux.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have the higher percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is you're going to get a
better reflection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see this as a greater
reflection, we're able to see more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: detail here in this water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a little bit lower
reflectivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see the same general where
the spire is here, where the green light
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's a much blurred image.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be a lower degree of reflectivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have that higher percentage
indicating we're losing less of the light
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're paying for with these
artificial light setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now cleaning the hoods, clean these
reflectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: New out of the box reflectors have their
peak of efficiency and cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to clean the hoods to ensure the
reflectors are able to do their job well
[SPEAKER_00]: and consistently over a growing season or
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful though when you're cleaning
them not to scratch them because that
[SPEAKER_00]: could do more long-term harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they do get dusty and they will get
a little tarnished and dirty, I do want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you go through and clean them,
but be careful what you clean them with
[SPEAKER_00]: because you could do more damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, you want to replace the
reflectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can often be purchased separately and
these can increase the light use
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency if cleaning is not enabled on
the reflector or if it's reach condition
[SPEAKER_00]: or it's beyond the ability to be cleaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: A typical reflector life, you can get
about two to four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four years is kind of the max reflector
before you want to go through and replace
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of growers are replacing bulbs
every year, replacing the reflectors every
[SPEAKER_00]: other year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on your conditions, you might
just stretch to four years, but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really the maximum you want to run any
reflector for.
[SPEAKER_00]: In closed reflective hoods, you want to
utilize glass between the plant and the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This reduces the heat transfer from the
bulb to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have the cooling system air or
sometimes liquid to help regulate heat
[SPEAKER_00]: buildup so the bulb inner valves do not
burn up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here carbon filter pulling air
through cooling that light and then
[SPEAKER_00]: exhausting it out the top here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This air cooled, and that's another we
just saw as an example of air cooled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pulls air through ducting to provide
cooling in a sealed hood system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inexpensive and easy to operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind the lights need a proper
temperature to operate and pulling in cold
[SPEAKER_00]: air from the outside may not be the best
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly in the northeast,
people think they're doing a good job in
[SPEAKER_00]: the winter by pulling directly in cold
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: While lights need to operate at certain
temperatures, you want to cool them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you want to say chill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this glass or plastic here will seal
up to allow this to be a controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's horizontal reflective hoods we see
with these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall the most efficient reflectors that
directs half of the light downward towards
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to have a hot spot directly
below the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes as we see here, there's also
additional reflectors in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps reduce the bulb hot spots and
increases reflectivity even more to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent the potential for burning the
plants below.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also vertical reflector hoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: These bulbs are hung vertically,
which is less efficient as light has to
[SPEAKER_00]: travel further before being reflected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that inverse square law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to keep those bulbs as
close to the plant as possible without
[SPEAKER_00]: burning them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of leads with parabolic
reflectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can act like an umbrella to help
direct the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally don't like the vertical
mounting even though this can increase
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't quite get as great of the mount
reflecting to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are losing some in just the general
inefficiency of the mounting of the
[SPEAKER_00]: direction of the bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open-ended reflective hoods that we see
here allow for extra airflow and reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the chance of overheating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aluminum will transfer heat more
efficiently, but steels often will
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't use a reflector, just go with
a naked bulb as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows the bulbs to run cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, the bulbs should be suspended
in the plants to take advantage of the 360
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees of light being emitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you mount it above the plants,
which is not advised, this can increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the risk of damage to the bulb and also
increase the amount of light loss,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would be about 60% when a reflector
is not used.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's advised to use not only a
new reflector, but one you're changing out
[SPEAKER_00]: about every two, three, at max four years
so you're maximizing the light that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: paying for.
[SPEAKER_00]: To hit the plant to be able to use for the
photosynthetic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
I'll see you in the next one.
