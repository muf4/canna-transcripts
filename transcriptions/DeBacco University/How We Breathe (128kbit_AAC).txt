[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to look at something
we probably take for granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how we breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a very important component to us
breathing is the diaphragm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what the diaphragm is is actually a
dome-shaped muscle and tendon plays a
[SPEAKER_00]: vital role in the breathing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see here what the diaphragm does,
it's kind of this green line here,
[SPEAKER_00]: not a completely accurate depiction,
but it's a line of change in volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a picture of that muscle and
that kind of increasing and changing in
[SPEAKER_00]: volume is what's causing air to come in
and air to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breathing is the act of pumping of air
in and out of the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while the diaphragm is completely
separate from the lungs, it is affecting
[SPEAKER_00]: the volume of the lungs, which is
affecting the air coming in or air
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the inhalation and exhalation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're breathing air in, the diaphragm
contracts and flattens and as you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: here, it's being pushed down, taking our
lung volume and increasing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This chest cavity expands downwards and
also outwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: This creates negative pressure and air
comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the exhalation process is basically the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diaphragm is relaxing in this case,
volume of chest cavity is decreasing and
[SPEAKER_00]: the pressure in the lungs is forcing air
out and that is the exhalation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see it represented here when
we're looking at the Boyle's gas law is a
[SPEAKER_00]: key component here and we have P equal
pressure and V equals volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So P1, V1 equals P2, V2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what does that kind of look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when the volume is decreasing,
our pressure is increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a constant temperature and
we have our pressure increasing when our
[SPEAKER_00]: volume is decreasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take our set volume there and we're
compressing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pressure is increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind as the volume increases,
the pressure decreases and you have this
[SPEAKER_00]: in volume versus relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the volume decreases, the pressure will
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a linear, it's kind of this kind
of this exponential scale, but you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: overall the pattern is as the volume
either increases, the pressure will do the
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see that example of that
volume decreasing and that pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the mechanism of breathing in humans,
we have typical breath at rest is about
[SPEAKER_00]: half a liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's called your tidal volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: When each breath is completed,
the lung still contains a volume of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's about 1.2 liters left behind
and that's called the residual volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each inhalation adds about 500 milliliters
at resting or 3,000 milliliters during
[SPEAKER_00]: exercising, that'd be three liters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each exhalation removes the same volume as
inhalation added.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does this kind of relate to if you
compare it to a two liter bottle or 2,000
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters soda bottle, this kind of puts
this in perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, your tidal volume is here and you
have your iteration volume, expiration
[SPEAKER_00]: volume, and then your residual volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still some air in your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't exhale it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just gives you a little bit of a
background on how we go about breathing.
