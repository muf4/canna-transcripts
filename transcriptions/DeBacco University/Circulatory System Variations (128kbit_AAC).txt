[SPEAKER_00]: So while all the animals pictured here
have a closed circulatory system,
[SPEAKER_00]: they each have their own different
variations that we're going to go into in
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit more detail here on how they
move blood through their bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start with a couple of
comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this might seem initially
confusing, but I am going to go through
[SPEAKER_00]: each in more detail, focus on each
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're comparing a fish to an
amphibian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a fish has the simplest circulatory
system of all the vertebrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their blood flows one direction and from a
two-chambered heart through the gills and
[SPEAKER_00]: into the rest of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in all the images, if we start at the
heart, looking at relieving the heart,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to the gills, where we're
having that exchange of carbon dioxide and
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That oxygenated blood is going to the
blood capillaries, meaning back here,
[SPEAKER_00]: going through the heart and going back
through the system here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a two-chamber heart, and it's just
kind of that one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to the amphibians now, they have two
ways or two routes that the blood can
[SPEAKER_00]: take, one for oxygenated blood through the
lungs and skin, and the other to take
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen to the rest of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blood is pumped through a
three-chambered heart with two atria and a
[SPEAKER_00]: single ventricle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here, blood is pumped through a
three-chamber heart with two atria,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's one located here, one here,
and a single ventricle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's our blood leaving, going
through the lungs or the skin capillaries,
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming oxygenated, returning back to the
heart here, and then leaving and being
[SPEAKER_00]: pumped here through the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the reason why this is an improvement
from our two-chambered heart is we're now
[SPEAKER_00]: having blood returning to the heart in
distinctive areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just going necessarily in one
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see already that it's more
complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact that there's only one
ventricle means here blood could be going
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the lungs or could be going out to
the body, so it's not necessarily as
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient as it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comparing the reptile and the mammals,
reptiles have two circulatory roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blood is only oxygenated through the
lungs because there's no skin contact with
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heart is also three-chambered,
just like our amphibians, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: ventricles are partially separated,
so the mixing of oxygenated and
[SPEAKER_00]: deoxygenated blood occurs, except in
crocodilians.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a slightly different category
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason, or the downfall that we're
seeing here is purple is representing kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of our partway deoxygenated blood,
and we're noticing it can be this mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our oxygenated blood returning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of mixing with our deoxygenated
blood, making this kind of in-between
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediate, kind of partially
oxygenated, partially deoxygenated,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's being circulated through.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most efficient way here is our
mammals, and they have a four-chamber
[SPEAKER_00]: heart that's completely separating out
oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pump's only oxygenated blood through
the body and deoxygenated blood to the
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our blue, we have deoxygenated
blood going to our lungs, being
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygenated, turning into a separate
portion of the heart that is then being
[SPEAKER_00]: exited out and goes to the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the most efficient,
this four-chamber heart, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing that complete separation between
deoxygenated and oxygenated blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at these hearts in a little bit
more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, that two-chambered heart for
the fish is one atrium, one ventricle,
[SPEAKER_00]: a single circulatory root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reptiles or amphibians have a
three-chambered heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They double the amount of atria,
but still remain only with one ventricle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, ventricle is the portion of
the heart pumping it to the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why this is not quite as
efficient, because we have both oxygenated
[SPEAKER_00]: and deoxygenated blood being mixed through
a double circulatory process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammals have the four-chambered heart,
the most efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two atria, two ventricles,
were both oxygenated and deoxygenated
[SPEAKER_00]: blood are separate and this is also double
circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking a little more specifically at the
simplicity of the fish, it's a two-chamber
[SPEAKER_00]: heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a single atrium, receives blood from
the body cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: A ventricle sends blood to the gills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our direction of blood flow,
and we kind of have this one way that the
[SPEAKER_00]: heart's just kind of pumping going out
here to the gills and kind of working its
[SPEAKER_00]: way right back around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So simplest of all the vertebrates,
two-chamber heart for fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three-chambered hearts separate out,
allow some separation of oxygenated and
[SPEAKER_00]: deoxygenated blood, which is an advantage
on land organisms such as reptiles and
[SPEAKER_00]: amphibians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though the blood can mix in the ventricle,
mixing is minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some reptiles have partial separation of
the ventricle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of at that first step of
having that separation of that
[SPEAKER_00]: deoxygenated and oxygenated blood,
and we see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our flow of blood, here's the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that mix that occurs before it's
being sent out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll provide you with a nice cross section
here with also labeling of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different portions of this three-chambered
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to our four-chambered heart,
seen in mammals and birds, and this allows
[SPEAKER_00]: for a complete separation of oxygenated
and deoxygenated blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: This complete separation allows for a fast
metabolism found in hemotherms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are organisms that are able to
maintain their own body temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are getting a little bit more
complicated We see that with our four
[SPEAKER_00]: chambers, two atria, two ventricles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have valves here separating out and a
separate physical separation here,
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing for oxygenated and deoxygenated
blood to be distinct and separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, deoxygenated blood is shown
in blue here, even though in the body we
[SPEAKER_00]: eat varying shades of red.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that deoxygenated blood is sent
directly to the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes back as oxygenated blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kept distinct and separate before
it's sent out through the body,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's going through capillaries,
and then the deoxygenated blood is then
[SPEAKER_00]: returning back to the heart there.
