[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at pesticide
application in safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these rules apply whether you're doing
a large scale spray or a little spot spray
[SPEAKER_00]: or spraying the whole field with a
backpack sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these rules still apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the key part here with safety is that
you want to read and follow the labels
[SPEAKER_00]: that are posted there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label is the law is kind of the nice
little way to remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to use only what's needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to use low toxicity pesticides if
that's an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to consider the weather if you're
an outdoor application don't apply just
[SPEAKER_00]: before a heavy rain and chance it could be
washed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you use proper equipment you're
getting good coverage for both the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and protecting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proper disposal of empty containers when
you're done or finish the pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Avoid contaminating the environment
meaning don't apply right next to
[SPEAKER_00]: waterways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protect from exposure for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post warning signs as we see here and no
emergency procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's good if you're applying them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a worker on an area that might be
using pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again we see these signs and danger and
these big red signs and the skull and the
[SPEAKER_00]: crossbones here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it is word for caution they can
be applied in a safe manner if you do take
[SPEAKER_00]: into consideration what the label says and
properly protect yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's different types of pesticide
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is wettable powders as we see here
with the cocoa powder to make chocolate
[SPEAKER_00]: milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wettable powders are a dry product that
mixes well with water to create a liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: suspension that can be applied through a
variety of methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers tend to like this because of the
small storage space of the actual product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's actual liquid products and
these are liquid suspensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers like the ease of use of this and
we see here with like cranberry juice
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ease of use with this product but
sometimes the binders can hold that hold
[SPEAKER_00]: the chemical and suspension can cause
increase the chance of leaf burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say some growers tend to like the
wettable powders because they lack that
[SPEAKER_00]: binding agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's duster powders and that can
be applied simply as like this powder
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers tend to have difficulty applying
these products and getting even coverage
[SPEAKER_00]: especially for outdoor applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost not possible because there's
always a little bit of a breeze if you
[SPEAKER_00]: develop it to get around plants with the
dust products.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's making product applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any systemic synthetic chemical
products are not advised for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: because they will go through the entire
plant and can end up in the buds and when
[SPEAKER_00]: burned can cause volatiles to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be careful to read the labels
however this presents quite a challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis because there's typically a
lack of labeling of products specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: listed for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprays can be beneficial but can be over
applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be mindful of when you made a last
application and why you're making that
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phyto-texicity can result as more damage
than benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be mindful as you want to be
applying something to your plants for the
[SPEAKER_00]: overall benefit not the harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the spray timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low light is preferred and that encourages
on outdoor applications and low light also
[SPEAKER_00]: in indoor applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to mix these products just
because you want to get it done quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do what's called a jar test
where you're mixing those ahead of time to
[SPEAKER_00]: see if there's any interactions that are
occurring and hot temps will increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: likelihood of damage to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important on outdoor applications if
you're experiencing a heat wave or indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: applications if you're applying it at the
peak of heating and heat of the grow space
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Product applicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant area and location will help in
deciding what's the best fit for your
[SPEAKER_00]: applicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a pump sprayer as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hand or backpack and it allows for
maximum grower control and best for small
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces and or localized applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here a mist blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's motorized and allows for quickest
coverage with minimal effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also get really tall on plants for
very high applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a leaf blower with a water
tank on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then with electric foggers and offer many
benefits as the mist blower here but
[SPEAKER_00]: better suited for indoor operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it can cover that nice kind of fog,
that even coverage of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just some different ways you can
apply pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking all these into consideration will
allow for efficient application for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and minimize environmental impacts.
Thank you.
you you
