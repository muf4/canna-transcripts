[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to learn about
calculating average atomic mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grab your calculators and play our home
game on calculating average atomic mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what is average atomic mass?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, average atomic mass is based on what
we call a weighted average of the isotopes
[SPEAKER_00]: that exist for an element.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind isotopes refers to atoms that
have different amounts of neutrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a weighted average, meaning we're
taking into account certain percentages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a straight add up by the
total number that you have and divide by
[SPEAKER_00]: that number.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number expressed, as we see here for
iron, 55.85 on the periodic table.
[SPEAKER_00]: This number is expressed even though there
is not an isotope of the element.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually has the mass stated on the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no isotope really has a mass of 55.85,
even though that's the number that we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can think about this related to grades.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to use this as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your average on the report card may not
represent any single one grade that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten or received, but that is stated as
your average.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be an example of a weighted
average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take this to the example looking
at grades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not just divide by the sum of the
total number?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because this is a weighted
average, so the percent abundance is taken
[SPEAKER_00]: into account.
[SPEAKER_00]: An isotope that may have a greater
percentage will have a greater influence
[SPEAKER_00]: on that average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're probably going, this doesn't
really make a whole lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's relate to something you're
probably a little bit more concerned
[SPEAKER_00]: about, which is grades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it as a grade average where
quizzes count less or a smaller percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: than a test.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, your grade is an example of
a weighted average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have two examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the student get the same
grade on quizzes, same grade on homework,
[SPEAKER_00]: test, lab reports, and projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example, since everything is
equal, if you notice our percent of final
[SPEAKER_00]: grade, everything is weighted the same,
we can add up all these numbers and divide
[SPEAKER_00]: by the total.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can add all these numbers up,
divide by five, because there's five
[SPEAKER_00]: different grades, and get our final
average.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in this case, which is what we're
going to focus on, this is a weighted
[SPEAKER_00]: average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this example, the exact same grades
need to count the weight of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quizzes count for 15%, homework is 10%,
tests are 40, lab reports are 15,
[SPEAKER_00]: products are 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with those same grades, we're going to
take our grade, multiply by the percent,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to convert this to a decimal,
which we're going to go over in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to give us a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: We add all of these numbers up,
we get the average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you can see with these weighted
average, because tests count so much and
[SPEAKER_00]: the test grade was so poor, it resulted in
a lower final grade than just the straight
[SPEAKER_00]: weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas everything being equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's now relate this to a chemistry
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking here, calculating average
atomic mass for boron, we're going to use
[SPEAKER_00]: this as another example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step one is to find the natural percent
abundance in the mass of each isotope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our mass and atomic mass units,
and here's the percent abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This information will be provided to you
in some way, not expected to memorize or
[SPEAKER_00]: know the percent abundance for these
different isotopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that the total percent
abundance should add up to 100% for all
[SPEAKER_00]: possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is percent abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to account for all the isotopes,
that'd be 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we want to convert the percent
abundance to a decimal and then multiply
[SPEAKER_00]: by mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we go about doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: To convert the percent to a decimal,
we divide by 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at our abundance,
we go back for one moment, 19.8% and 88.2%
[SPEAKER_00]: are then converted to 0.198 and 0.802.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our example here, 47.8% would be
expressed as 0.478.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're simply moving the decimal two places
to the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then want to multiply the mass,
here expressed in atomic mass units,
[SPEAKER_00]: times the abundance to get a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have these numbers, we're going to
go through and we're going to take the
[SPEAKER_00]: sum, will be the average of the atomic
masses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take 1.98 and add it to 8.83.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our weighted average would be 10.8%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which would be the weighted average for
boron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're feeling confident or you
want to review that again, I want you to
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate the average atomic mass for
iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave you this example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the problem is, in this example,
I leave two things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the percent abundance and one is
the mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mass is pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the isotope is 54 and the mass
is 54.
[SPEAKER_00]: 56, 56.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this question mark would be simply 57.
[SPEAKER_00]: The percent abundance, we have to remember
what I said earlier, these all have to add
[SPEAKER_00]: up to 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though I don't give you the
percent or expect you to memorize it,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we add these all up and subtract from
100, we can figure out that percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we see here, step one is to fill in the
gaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: 57, that's the isotope number provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 5.80% is to be calculated by adding up
all the other percents and subtracting
[SPEAKER_00]: from 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step two is to convert the percents to
decimals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I misspelled careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful here because when we divide by
100, watch the placement of the decimal
[SPEAKER_00]: points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where a lot of students get tripped up
here is .28.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have to move that decimal two
places to the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that becomes .0028.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same here with 2.2%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look back, 2.2%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes, decimal two places,
.0220 is our abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just like we did previously,
we're going to multiply the mass by the
[SPEAKER_00]: abundance and put the number in the right
column here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note, significant figures have been
ignored for demonstration purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go over significant figures right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just trying to get you to understand
the basic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all of our mass times
abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, in red, we're just the items that
were left out in the original example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We add these all together and we have our
calculated weighted mass here.
[SPEAKER_00]: By simply adding up the weighted masses up
to get the average atomic mass right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be expressed in AMUs or atomic
mass units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, there's no need to divide
because the percent abundance has already
[SPEAKER_00]: been taken into account to generate our
average atomic mass for iron, which would
[SPEAKER_00]: be 55.9116.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at a periodic table and you
may not get the exact same answer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it should be very close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
