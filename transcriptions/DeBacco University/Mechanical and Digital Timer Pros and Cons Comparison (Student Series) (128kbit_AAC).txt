[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University student series
video, we're going to look at both the
[SPEAKER_00]: pros and cons and compare a mechanical
timer to a digital timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, many of you may make the decision of
using one versus another, but this is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to provide you with that information
so you can make an educated decision on
[SPEAKER_00]: which one is the best for your growing
operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are both timers that you could use
for your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is a digital timer and this one
is a mechanical timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both have their pros and cons,
which we will be going over in this video
[SPEAKER_01]: so that you can determine which is best
for your operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're going to go over the pros and
cons of a mechanical timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you can see, a mechanical timer is a
bit more straightforward and simple than a
[SPEAKER_01]: digital timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot less going on right here for
you to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, you only have to press down some
buttons and move some things left and
[SPEAKER_01]: right for it to be set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: A con would be that you have to set it up
through 15 minute increments.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most precise that you could be on this
is by 15 minutes, which isn't usually a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem, but some people would like to
have it be a little bit more precise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another con is on the side, we have a
switch that goes from timer to indefinite.
[SPEAKER_01]: This means that the light will be on
indefinitely and it's very easy to
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes switch this into the indefinite,
meaning that your light will not switch
[SPEAKER_01]: off when you have it scheduled to,
meaning that your photo period may be
[SPEAKER_01]: interrupted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're going to be talking about the
pros and cons of a digital timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the pros are that it's just more
precise in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the exact time and we have a
bunch more buttons to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see we could adjust the day of the
week, the hour, the minute, even the
[SPEAKER_01]: second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another pro is that it has a battery
backup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just in case something was to happen
where you lose power, this will actually
[SPEAKER_01]: remember what time it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will retain the exact time so that
nothing is really changed within your
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule for when the lights turn back on
or off.
[SPEAKER_01]: A con would be that it's just a little
more complicated than a mechanical timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're used to a mechanical timer,
then all of these buttons may be a little
[SPEAKER_01]: overwhelming at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you may be confused as to why you
need seconds when before you were
[SPEAKER_01]: adjusting by the 15 minute increments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another con is that it's kind of just the
buttons are tiny and close together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had big fingers, you have the
risk of pressing multiple buttons or if
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody was being careless, they could
accidentally hit one of these buttons,
[SPEAKER_01]: which could change your timing from being
auto to just on all the time or off all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time, which would impact your photo
period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another con is that unlike a mechanical
timer, you can't really see the logistics
[SPEAKER_01]: of what's happening inside this timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just kind of have to hope that
everything's going on properly within the
[SPEAKER_01]: timer and just keep checking to see if
anything looks off just by this little
[SPEAKER_01]: screen here rather than being able to see
everything that's going on with your
[SPEAKER_01]: timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that we've gone through the pros
and cons of both the mechanical and
[SPEAKER_01]: digital timer is that for you as a grower
to decide which one you would like to
[SPEAKER_01]: implement in your grow operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, a tip from Tobago himself would be to
use the digital timer for your pumps
[SPEAKER_01]: because when you feed your plants is very
important down to the exact second.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so use the mechanical timer for your
lights because a 15 minute difference
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't going to drastically affect your
photo period.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the end, it is up to you whether you
will decide to use a digital or a
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanical timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way, it'll be one step closer to
fully automating your grow and making your
[SPEAKER_01]: life a step easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
