[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to go in a little
detail about controlling CO2 levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see in the image here is an actual
controller brain box.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a remote sensor here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a power cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these can work in unison to help
regulate CO2 levels in a grow facility
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the CO2 levels?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well monitoring CO2 levels is critical to
maintain an efficient grow operation,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking it could be a small grow
tent, could be a large room, could be even
[SPEAKER_00]: a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monitoring the CO2 levels are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's important to remember it's
one thing to know the CO2 levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's another thing to do something
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just monitoring and know the CO2 levels
is one step in the right direction,
[SPEAKER_00]: but being able to correct those or
maintain those at a certain level would be
[SPEAKER_00]: the next step or logical progression a
grower should take.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's CO2 controllers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the one pictured here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality CO2 controllers are directly
connected to a delivery system which
[SPEAKER_00]: offers the greatest level of control over
the CO2 levels in a grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're monitoring and they're adding
or kicking on a system when they need to,
[SPEAKER_00]: when the CO2 levels are getting too low
and turn off when it's getting too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: These controllers are the best for
maintaining levels of carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: within a certain predetermined range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you want to add CO2, well CO2 can
benefit the plant through all stages of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even pretty much from just beyond
seedling phase all the way to the end it
[SPEAKER_00]: is beneficial to add CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it should only be added during
daylight hours because this is when the
[SPEAKER_00]: light dependent reaction of photosynthesis
is active and this is the plant when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as stages of plants go,
the entire stage of growth, but as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: when specifically on a day-to-day basis,
when the sunlight's out or when the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: are on is the best time to be dosing
carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we're looking at dosing there can
be timers or controllers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timers are by far less expensive and they
release carbon dioxide at a consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: predetermined intervals and durations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This requires calculations and estimations
of plant consumption and a photocell is
[SPEAKER_00]: advised to ensure only daytime dosing is
provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that here on this timer here
there's a photocell meaning this will only
[SPEAKER_00]: activate this repeat cycle timer when this
is getting exposed to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good option to have if you're
going with the timer system.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they do tend to lead to kind of
an estimation and they can lead to that
[SPEAKER_00]: loss or wasting of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a little bit better is controllers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They react to a given current conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows for adjustments to be made to
maximize efficiency and help ensure CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: levels are being maintained.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, these controllers are
preferred over those timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the one pictured here can work
with generators, can work with tank
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, has a lot of options that can be
utilized there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though controllers are much preferred over
timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now controllers have you select a max and
minimum and maintain within this range.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is improvement over timers but it can
still lead to wasted CO2 by overshooting
[SPEAKER_00]: the maximum over the course of changing
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you want to look for in a
controller, what the best controllers are,
[SPEAKER_00]: are ones that have something called fuzzy
logic and it's kind of listed right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking for controllers are definitely an
advantage over timers and the preferred
[SPEAKER_00]: controllers are ones that have this called
fuzzy logic mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They help maintain this kind of efficient
levels of CO2 without over or under dosing
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a separate video on that if you
care to learn more about the fuzzy logic.
Thank you.
Have a great day.
