[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here I'm going to go over proper
lighting for cannabis and how the
[SPEAKER_00]: different stages can have different light
requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the general light requirements,
looking at the grow stage, clones
[SPEAKER_00]: typically will be a little bit less PAR or
PPF D ratings in a seedling, simply
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the stress that they're going
under.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind that there is a range
provided here and that can depend on other
[SPEAKER_00]: factors such as temperature and humidity
and just general growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But something to shoot for for clones is 1
to 200, sometimes going to be just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit higher than 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seedlings 1 to 300, typically you want to
keep them not getting leggy, you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them nice and robust, so that's a
good range to shoot for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetative, we're increasing kind of from
that 300 to get as high as 600 and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing them into flower, that kind of end
finisher there, looking for 600 plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are kind of just general light
requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you just something to shoot for
or it gives you an idea of a range of what
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis plant needs at different
stages of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now growers will ask, well should I add
side lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I'm adding looking at a lot of
lights on the ceiling and pointing down,
[SPEAKER_00]: should I add side lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well reflective walls are advised and
while side lighting may not hurt,
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual effectiveness may not be worth
the additional cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over plant lighting is the most efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be the focus along with the
quality reflector that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little less importance on side lights,
but reflective wall service is advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those room walls, as much attention as
painted reflectors do not forget the walls
[SPEAKER_00]: of a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reflective walls can add light that would
otherwise be lost or wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically reflective material will be like
Mylar, which is about 92 to 97%
[SPEAKER_00]: reflectability, and Rustoleum 2850 140
Ultra Matte Interior Chopped Paint,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's kind of this white paint,
is something else to consider if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the need to paint the walls of
a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lights can play favorites, so even
lighting is the goal, but sometimes this
[SPEAKER_00]: is not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may be necessary to rotate plants to
ensure they're receiving evenly dispersed
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: To kind of use that here as our salad,
what would you add to your salad?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well some people might pick more of one
thing than another, so they can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: play favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind if you see a plant leaning
over to one way, you want to just rotate
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant 90 degrees so it's just getting
an even amount of light and not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a hard time kind of pruning that or
trellising that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or getting that plant to grow in the way
that you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to maximize light, so while it's
not advised, if you are in a grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: where space is an issue, use the light at
the perimeter from a high intensity light
[SPEAKER_00]: and place clones or seedlings,
as this grower has here, so you get
[SPEAKER_00]: diffused light of lights that you're
already running.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here the candle, as you get
further away, you get more diffused light.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if possible, you want to avoid
this scenario because it can involve
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing plants in different areas,
in different ages, which can potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: infect plants with disease or cross
contaminate with insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, can it be done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it advised?
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, you want to keep your clones
and seedlings in an isolated, separate
[SPEAKER_00]: location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant spacing over crowning will reduce
yields and lead to an increased chance for
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to only have the tips of two
plants touching to ensure maximum plant
[SPEAKER_00]: density while still providing the
opportunity for good air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why lights can determine the area
or the grow space that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows a little bit of the ideal
situation here where just the tips are
[SPEAKER_00]: touching.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see where one plant may have been
moved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how that looks like a gap
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit too dense here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing kind of leaves on top of
leaves, and it's kind of reducing the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of light that can penetrate this
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, there's this thing called light
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers will give plants 36 hours of
continuous darkness before inducing
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: They claim quicker time to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this isn't a necessary stress,
and I do not advise this 36 hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply move the plants over to the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can flip the lights to 12 hours,
even 12 and 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to give them this 36 hours
of continuous darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's unneeded stress on those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this provides you just a good
idea of the proper lighting for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and the general requirements at the
different stages provided for you there.
