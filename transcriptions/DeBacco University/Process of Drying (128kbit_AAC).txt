[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to go over the process of
drying cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we think about drying,
hair dryer, we think about putting clothes
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the line to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some methods are quicker, some methods are
slower, and there's advantages and
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantages to both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll try to present the proper way to
dry cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the importance of drying, first off,
regardless of what process you choose,
[SPEAKER_00]: drying is very critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can make or break the end product that
you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freshly harvested material will have
little potency, and will burn very poorly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just speaks to the importance of
having a drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of the drying process is to have
an even, slow progression to allow a high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality end product to be sold or used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this drying process, fresh green buds
that are full of moisture, and that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: causes them to have a potentially diluted,
kind of like poor taste, and to burn
[SPEAKER_00]: unevenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're just to pick a bud right off
the plant and smoke it, or add heat to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going to have that high moisture
content, and you're not going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: really the potency there, kind of that
greenish taste that's usually referred to
[SPEAKER_00]: as.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proper drying will remove about 75% of the
moisture, which will concentrate the taste
[SPEAKER_00]: when smoked, and also concentrate those
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This drying process that takes a slow time
for plants over a week is better than
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to speed dry the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that 75% that's lost, we don't want
that to occur all in one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have a slow dry down process,
as that will produce a higher quality end
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers believe in hanging the
plants, cutting them down and hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hanging the plants upside down is an okay
way to dry them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will not help drain the
cannabinoids to the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a good way to dry them,
but don't think it's going to help
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the cannabinoids by having them
flow down to the buds with the force of
[SPEAKER_00]: gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an old myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids are fixed in the plant,
but will not move based on the position
[SPEAKER_00]: during the drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, hanging them upside down is a
great way to dry them, but don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to concentrate cannabinoids in
any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Faster speed drying is not advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick drying will result in the end
product that burns with a harsh smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of greenish kind of taste,
as I had said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often it's not the goal in seeking to
produce a high quality end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat that's often added will reduce the
drying time to only a few hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: which may sound great, but if you dry it
with too much heat, about over 200 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit, that can degrade cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often they'll need to be dried and then
maybe re-dried after they're allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of go through a sweating process,
put them in a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can just, sweating could
potentially cause some moisture to build
[SPEAKER_00]: up, could cause some mold to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other growers will actually dice up
the buds and cut them up, but this is not
[SPEAKER_00]: really a preferred method since most end
users want to see and inspect the full
[SPEAKER_00]: intact bud, as that's a sign of higher
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry time should be about five to seven
plus days or so to allow for uniform
[SPEAKER_00]: drying with minimal cannabinoid breakdown,
that desiccation process, that drying slow
[SPEAKER_00]: process is advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large leaves from plants can be removed at
harvest to help in even and more drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: This drying process you can think of kind
of like aging wine and barrels here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slower and longer is typically revered as
better in producing a higher end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same here can be applied to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching and have a great day.
