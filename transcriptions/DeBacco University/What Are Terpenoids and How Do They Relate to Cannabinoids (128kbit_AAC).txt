[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBacco University video,
I'm going to answer the question,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are terpenoids and how do they relate
to cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's get to answering the
question, what are terpenoids and how do
[SPEAKER_00]: they relate to cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, terpenes versus terpenoids
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's kind of the general comparison?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a great kind of difference
between for definition, structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: types, and uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, these are often used as
interchangeable terms, but they do have
[SPEAKER_00]: different definitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see different classifications
and categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes are the naturally occurring
combination of carbon and hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenoids are terpenes that have been
modified through a drying and curing
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, that's a chemical modification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that does is that alters the
oxygen content of the compounds we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about on the molecular level
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenoids are a subset of terpenes that
contain additional functional groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these functional groups could have
been added to produce a desired effect or
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be a naturally occurring in the
drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have the structure again,
terpenes, simple hydrocarbon compound,
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenoids, hydrocarbon compound with
oxygen containing functional groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of an important structural difference
there as well as the other differences you
[SPEAKER_00]: see listed right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are terpenes then?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are kind of like, let's look at just
the general sense, what are terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we've heard probably that term
referred to quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And terpenes are organic hydrocarbons
found in essential oils of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chemist terpenes are produced in the
trichomes of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what provides the unique scent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpene smell allows us to make
inferences about the strain and possible
[SPEAKER_00]: physiological effects that it may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the five most common listed here
and kind of a standardized approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot of wheels being used with
terpenes to help, again, create a good
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison in an organized form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more of these terpenes will be
described in details on other videos here
[SPEAKER_00]: on Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can impact terpenes just in
general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the reason plants develop terpenes
in the first place is to attract
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinators or reject predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research suggests that these compounds can
have medical properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they might be important for human use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what can impact them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the growing environment,
the growing substrate and the time that
[SPEAKER_00]: you go through and harvest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here we're seeing kind of a comparison
again, provided by a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take it for what it's worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at our standard kind of lighting
and then adding UVA and UVB light and the
[SPEAKER_00]: alterations in terpene concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they kind of give all of the values
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see the total terpene
concentrations are particularly higher for
[SPEAKER_00]: mycin and limonene increased by 40 to 50%
with the addition of UVA and UVB light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one example here of just that growing
environment can change the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to mention the substrate or the time
that you select to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So identified terpenes, again,
this is hopefully not too confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's meant to be a really kind of
interesting way to kind of provide an
[SPEAKER_00]: organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are over a hundred different
identified terpenes in the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while the differences can be subtle,
there are classification systems in place
[SPEAKER_00]: to reduce confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: General smell classifications we see like
the spicy and the kind of the sour
[SPEAKER_00]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see also the earthy smells,
the sweet smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's commonly shown on a terpene
wheel to try to try to develop that
[SPEAKER_00]: organization presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I consider this to be a little bit
more of an improved wheel by terpene type
[SPEAKER_00]: and that smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Classify them and to give you more
information about each of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you the boiling points of them,
the aromas, the effects, what they're also
[SPEAKER_00]: found in and the key medical benefits,
as well as some strains that may have
[SPEAKER_00]: favored that particular type of terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: These terpene categories are an
improvement method of organization over
[SPEAKER_00]: the aroma given off, kind of a little bit
of non-scientific way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This presentation also includes additional
properties for each for improved
[SPEAKER_00]: comparisons to be easily made.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the boiling points?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they different?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the general aromas also included
but not the main way of organization?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how terpenes relate to cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: To get to that central question there,
technically speaking, phytocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: are a form of a terpenoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are metroterpenoids, meaning they
have a partial terpenoid structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much of the commercial and therapeutic
value of cannabis comes from the aromatic
[SPEAKER_00]: monoterpenes, which have synergistic
effect when consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthermore, the aromatic therapeutic
effects of monoterpenes have been
[SPEAKER_00]: clinically shown effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of shows you the, quote,
marijuana, which is your above 0.3% THC in
[SPEAKER_00]: your hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a federal standpoint, what they can
both produce, they both can produce
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and terpenes, different
percentages, different combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, knowing your cannabis plant and
knowing what it could produce,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how terpenes can relate to
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are both produced by the cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this brings us to the entourage
effect, which is a more, there's another
[SPEAKER_00]: video on this channel that goes into this
in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, the entourage effect
describes a mechanism where cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: substances work together to optimize the
overall psychoactive benefits of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is that you want to find the best
terpenes to cannabinoid ratio possible for
[SPEAKER_00]: your desired effect because as we see
here, all these dotted lines, all these
[SPEAKER_00]: connections, there is a web here of
interactions, not just one thing that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of systematically leading to another
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of interactions that can
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And understanding those interactions can
create a more beneficial medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this all comes back to the very end
here, the importance of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not every plant in a given strain will
have the same levels of terpenes through
[SPEAKER_00]: the expression of individual plants'
phenotypes as well as the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to be sure is through a
terpene analysis from a cannabis testing
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure anything you're looking at
purchasing, make sure you're getting these
[SPEAKER_00]: certificate of analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look slightly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's important to look at the terpene
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to look at the
cannabinoids, but also make sure that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: passing tests for heavy metals,
pesticides, microbiology, things like that
[SPEAKER_00]: to ensure you're getting a clean product
as well as a product that also has a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular profile that you deem
desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
