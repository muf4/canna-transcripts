[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at
different carbon fixation pathways for
[SPEAKER_00]: what's called C3, C4, and CAM plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part we've been talking about
composite synthesis and relating to C3
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually two other pathways that
go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, please realize each uses carbon
dioxide and ultimately all three of these
[SPEAKER_00]: produce glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how they go about doing this that's
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've been talking about so far is the
C3 plant and that's the most simplest of
[SPEAKER_00]: forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: C4 plants use the mesophyll to have a four
carbon intermediate and then the Calvin
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle actually occurs in the bundle she
sells.
[SPEAKER_00]: CAM plants have a day-night cycle to be
able to compare the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just things to keep in mind
as we go through and compare them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just giving you a little bit of
orientation, the mesophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember we learned this from the
cross-sections of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: This compromises the bulk of internal leaf
tissue and the majority site of the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic process in plants since
they contain large amounts of chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inner tissue parenchyma of a leaf
containing many chloroplasts is located
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bundle sheath cells, see here,
layer of cells and leaves and stems that
[SPEAKER_00]: surround vascular bundles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember vascular bundles here are xylem
and phloem.
[SPEAKER_00]: In C4 plants, the bundle sheath cells
contain chloroplasts and are the site of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Calvin cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, be able to compare C3,
C4, and also CAM plants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just giving you an example of each,
C3 is most plants and they follow the
[SPEAKER_00]: steps presented as what we call normal and
it's located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calvin cycle occurs in the mesophyll and
occurs in CO2 directly and produces
[SPEAKER_00]: glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: C4 plants, carbon dioxide is incorporated
into a four carbon compound in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mesophyll and the Calvin cycle occurs in
the bundle sheath cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the CAM pathway, carbon dioxide is
actually stored as an acid at night and
[SPEAKER_00]: then is fed through the Calvin cycle
during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the Calvin cycle here is
occurring in the mesophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you an idea of what these plants
make connect to, C3 plants would be an
[SPEAKER_00]: example of a tomato plant, C4 plants would
be like corn, and CAM plants would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: cactus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So C3 plants, common plant type of the
Calvin cycle binding carbon dioxide to the
[SPEAKER_00]: ribisco enzyme, most efficient during cool
and moist conditions with normal light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is compared to C4 and CAM plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most plants live in cool, moist conditions
with normal light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why most plants are C3 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's just a couple examples,
typical garden plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we got a field of crops, all C3
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: C4 now is where we're starting to differ.
[SPEAKER_00]: C4 plants have an intermediate before
carbon dioxide binds to the ribisco,
[SPEAKER_00]: which benefits the plants in hotter
climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corn, sugarcane, and crabgrass are
examples of C4 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stomata are still open during the day,
which is an important step, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: different than a CAM plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice those intermediates, oxyacetate and
malate, I tried to highlight here in
[SPEAKER_00]: little blue circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an intermediate step before carbon
dioxide binds with the ribisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: This intermediate before goes through that
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here, carbon dioxide incorporated into
a four-carbon compound, oxyacetate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon dioxide is shelled via malate or
aspartate from the mesophil cells to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bundle sheath cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these bundle sheath cells, carbon
dioxide is released by decarboxylation of
[SPEAKER_00]: malate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does all this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our carbon dioxide coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this kind of intermediate that's
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, if you remember from our regular
photosynthetic process, instead of the
[SPEAKER_00]: three-carbon PGA compound in C3 plants,
we're using this acid as an intermediate
[SPEAKER_00]: to bind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, this four-carbon compound,
so it's going to feed the carbon from the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide into the Calvin cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the Calvin cycle doesn't change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the preparation these plants go
through to be able to deliver that carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: has this intermediate step.
[SPEAKER_00]: With highlight in temperature,
C4 plants can photosynthesize faster than
[SPEAKER_00]: C3 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: C4 plants have better water use efficiency
because the use of the PEP carboxylase
[SPEAKER_00]: brings carbon dioxide in faster and can
keep the stomata closed longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the advantage to the four-carbon
intermediate is that in highlight and
[SPEAKER_00]: water stress conditions, C4 plants can
take up carbon dioxide more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also better in highlight in these
temperature conditions because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: able to keep the stomata closed longer,
eliminating water loss, and corn plants
[SPEAKER_00]: would be this example versus our C3
plants, which would be, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: an elm tree here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this direct binding of carbon
dioxide in the mesophil cells and close
[SPEAKER_00]: the stomata, and then the carbon dioxide
can essentially, we'll say, be processed
[SPEAKER_00]: before entering the Calvin cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's just a comparison of C3 plants at
low light and at highlight and the rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice that the carbon dioxide
concentration, though, differs between our
[SPEAKER_00]: C4 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even at almost no carbon dioxide,
the rate of carbon dioxide uptake is
[SPEAKER_00]: greater in C4 plants simply because
they're slightly more efficient at it and
[SPEAKER_00]: you keep their stomata closed longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cam plants are acetylacin acid metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Succulents in cacti are examples commonly
found in very hot, dry areas such as
[SPEAKER_00]: deserts.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these plants, carbon dioxide is stored
in the form of an acid before the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic process can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stomata are open at night,
and the question is, well, what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of opening stomata at night?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't they do it during the day,
like just about all the other plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a specific reason for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're in such hot and dry
environments, the water loss would be too
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opening stomata at night, allowing CO2 to
come in, eliminates lots of water loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind that we need light to
form the photosynthetic process,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this creates a challenge in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sticking with those cam plants,
day versus night, see there's definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: differences between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We noticed our stomata are closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, during night, it is open.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's allowing carbon dioxide to come in,
but water vapor is also leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because it's at night, not a lot of
hot sunlight intensity, the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: water lost is definitely reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they need to have steps in place to be
able to utilize that CO2 to be able to use
[SPEAKER_00]: in the light reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you a little bit of an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: At night, evaporation rates are typically
lower, reducing water loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon dioxide is converted to an acid,
and that's the key part here, our malate
[SPEAKER_00]: acid, before being used in the
light-dependent reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cam plants, during the day,
the acid is broken down, and the CO2 is
[SPEAKER_00]: released into a probisco for the
photosynthetic process to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply put, that stomata is opening,
carbon dioxide is coming in, that carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: is being stored as an acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then during the day, these stomata are
closed, and this acid now is being fed
[SPEAKER_00]: into the light-dependent reaction,
and that carbon dioxide is being released,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the normal C3 plant photosynthetic
process occurs, but the stomata remain
[SPEAKER_00]: closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That carbon dioxide is being released from
the acid, and that closed stomata during
[SPEAKER_00]: the day eliminates the water loss of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general summary, carbon dioxide stored
as a forward carbon acid malate in
[SPEAKER_00]: vacuoles at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the daytime, the malate is
transported to chloroplasts, where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: converted back to carbon dioxide,
which is then used for the photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pre-collected carbon dioxide is
concentrated around the enzyme probisco,
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing photosynthetic efficiency,
and that's what we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our day, here's our night cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: At night, our carbon dioxide is coming in,
we're storing it as an acid in the
[SPEAKER_00]: vacuole, then during the day, we're
releasing that acid, we're breaking apart
[SPEAKER_00]: the CO2, running it through the Calvin
cycle to generate our sugars in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, this occurs with plants in
extremely dry and arid conditions like
[SPEAKER_00]: these cactus here.
