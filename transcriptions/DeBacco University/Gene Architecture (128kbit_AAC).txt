[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here I'm going to go over some
of the details regarding gene
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's gene?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it comprised of?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it organized?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are components to a gene to help
cells function?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the obvious question is
just, you know, what is a gene?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we define a gene?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a gene is kind of the work of some
scientists that basically determine that
[SPEAKER_00]: genes reside in chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chromosomes contain proteins,
known as histones, and DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within the chromosome here,
the little x, you have that condensed form
[SPEAKER_00]: of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's again, here's our DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these little green circles are
histones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, what is the
hereditary material?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the protein or is it the DNA here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking specifically at
those histones, that protein structure
[SPEAKER_00]: that helps organize the DNA, those
histones are actually very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we have our chromosome,
we have our chromatid, we have our DNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we have those histones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, think of this, if we have this very
long piece of string, it's very easy for
[SPEAKER_00]: it to get tangled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, histones are little protein
structures that allow that DNA to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like wrap around to help keep it
organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it kind of wrapping around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of calls like balls on a chain,
kind of all kind of a way to nicely
[SPEAKER_00]: condense the DNA instead of just taking a
large piece of string and just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: cram it all together to kind of our rat's
nest there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very organized way to be able to
keep that DNA together, organized and
[SPEAKER_00]: condensed for the process of cell
division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Histones actually have other purposes
here, but here we're just looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that they organize DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, within those histones, this gives you
another kind of image or picture of how it
[SPEAKER_00]: looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's within our nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's our histones, these little
blue spheres here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when it says silent and active,
the sound is kind of like taking all those
[SPEAKER_00]: spheres and kind of condensing them and
keeping them tightly packed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very hard for other mechanisms to get in
there and kind of express those genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here the active form, we see it more
spaced out, greater space, that's allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: for these genes to be active or turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these histones help that organization
of that DNA into potentially an active or
[SPEAKER_00]: a silent or inactive form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're looking at the architecture of
a gene in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they kind of look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have that DNA, which is very
important, and we're speaking here in
[SPEAKER_00]: eukaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genes are basically fragmented and they're
composed of two components, exons and
[SPEAKER_00]: introns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why they named them this way,
but the exons are sequences that code for
[SPEAKER_00]: amino acids and the introns don't have any
coding regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at our DNA here and then
we're going to RNA in our mRNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately want to take that full length
DNA composed of exons and introns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, only the exons are kept and we see
that in our final messenger RNA here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So exons, a lot of people think,
oh, they exit.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, exons are kept together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the coding regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the introns that don't, the introns
are spliced out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see here's our total DNA
sequence, here's our RNA and our messenger
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA will only be composed of those exons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the reason is this, if there's a
mutation or a nucleotide base that's an
[SPEAKER_00]: error, hopefully it falls in one of the
intron areas, it's spliced out and doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This way the cells don't have to make
necessarily every single nucleotide
[SPEAKER_00]: pairing and match up be absolutely
critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise one little flip would cause a
major mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, there are some basically non-coding
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: As architecture of the gene, again,
speaking for eukaryotes, eukaryotic cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: they transcribe the entire gene producing
a primary RNA transcript.
[SPEAKER_00]: This transcript is then heavily processed
to produce mature messenger RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: transcript.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mRNA leaves a nucleus for the
cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our primary RNA transcript has the exons
and the introns.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's then an RNA processing that occurs
and that will basically splice out those
[SPEAKER_00]: introns and only the exons will be left
into that final messenger RNA which will
[SPEAKER_00]: then be sent out to the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a five prime cap and a poly A tail
also added after it's spliced as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're looking here, we want to notice
the locations of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have up here the gene contains both
exons and introns, that's the full DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the RNA is processed to remove the
introns.
[SPEAKER_00]: That final process located over here is
the messenger RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That messenger RNA will only contain the
exons and this mature messenger RNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: M stands for messenger, so mature
messenger RNA, mature mRNA, travels to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoplasm where it's responsible for the
synthesizing of important proteins for the
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what does this look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, alternating splicing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have this kind of combination,
produces three different proteins at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same section of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice the alteration of the order of the
exons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the exons are the coding regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in this case we have five exons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have the RNA with the five exons
and also the introns, single stranded
[SPEAKER_00]: versus double stranded.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have alternate splicing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, of these five exons, in this first
protein, protein A, we have them in exon
[SPEAKER_00]: order one, two, three, four, five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense, is how it's presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, alternate splicing was if we take
those same exons, we mix the order up.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we have only exons one,
two, four, and five.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're missing number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to create a different
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have one, two, three, and five.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took number four out and you could see
a different protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the way that cells or DNA can
conserve the amount of new DNA sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just simply mixing the order up will
change the proteins and vastly change the
[SPEAKER_00]: function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, processing eukaryotic mRNA through
RNA splicing, what does this occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, different combinations of exons can
generate different polypeptides via
[SPEAKER_00]: alternate splicing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just saw that in a previous slide there
where we have our pre-messenger RNA and
[SPEAKER_00]: through different splicing and the
different combinations of those exons,
[SPEAKER_00]: different order of those exons will create
different end products, in this case
[SPEAKER_00]: polypeptides known as proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: The promoter region in a DNA sequence,
it's the region of DNA that initiates the
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription of a gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: The promoter is the on or off switch to a
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's located towards a five prime end and
it will initiate or allow that coding
[SPEAKER_00]: region to then be basically expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or trans into our RNA sequence here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the architecture of a gene,
so kind of the title here, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a segment of DNA located on the
chromosome that contains instructions for
[SPEAKER_00]: protein production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just looking at chromosome from
parent one and parent two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there'll be a certain locus,
a certain region for height, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're looking at P's,
looking at Gregor Mendel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at P pods, whether it
will be wrinkled or smooth in that locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be the locus or the section of gene
for the architecture within the general P
[SPEAKER_00]: pod, whether it be a smooth P pod or a
wrinkled P pod.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this, if we look at the big
chromosome here, we look at that in a more
[SPEAKER_00]: detailed level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see those histones ultimately to
that DNA level of introns and exons
[SPEAKER_00]: composing of the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, lastly here, just controlling the
gene, whether it gets turned on or it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gets turned off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, genes are typically controlled at
the level of transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so the cell's not going to waste
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In procreates, proteins are either blocked
to allow RNA polymerase to access the
[SPEAKER_00]: promoter or they're repressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So repressors will block the promoter
region, that kind of on and off switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like someone puts a cover over the on
or off switch and won't be able to turn
[SPEAKER_00]: that light on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Activators make the promoter more
accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's kind of like a nightlight over
the light switch to make it easier to find
[SPEAKER_00]: in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most genes are turned off except when
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cells have a lot of genes and the
whole point is not to have them all on at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see here just some examples
looking at our prokaryotes where they have
[SPEAKER_00]: different food sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So low glucose and lactose is available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in this case, we're having the
activator go right through and make these
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case here, we're high glucose and
lactose is unavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to repress those particular
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see the same thing here where
lactose is unavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where lactose is available, we're having
some level of expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at the lac operon in prokaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at activating these lac genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If lactose is not available, there's no
point in running that or having the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: go through the process of expressing those
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, that promoter region will be
repressed and those genes will be
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially turned off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this gives you a nice little
background here of gene architecture to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you a little insight into the
complexity is going on within cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
