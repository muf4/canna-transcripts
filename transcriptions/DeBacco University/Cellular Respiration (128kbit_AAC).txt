[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to provide a brief
overview of cellular respiration,
[SPEAKER_00]: focused mainly on glycolysis, Krebs cycle,
and the electron transport chain here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the quick overview of cellular
respiration is a controlled sequence of
[SPEAKER_00]: steps releasing energy from sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially glucose is converted back to
carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to think about cellular
respiration is it's the opposite of the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cellular respiration occurs in active
cells, meaning both plant and animal
[SPEAKER_00]: cells, and the mitochondria is the
organelle where this process takes place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at kind of the equation
here, glucose plus six oxygens through the
[SPEAKER_00]: process of cellular respiration yields
carbon dioxide, water, and energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is occurring in the
mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat and ATP or energy are being
essentially released, and it's taking in
[SPEAKER_00]: glucose and oxygen, and that's made for
the process of photosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's releasing carbon dioxide,
which is then needed, or combined with
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight or solar energy and water to form
the glucose and oxygen that then the
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondria need to use, and the circle
goes around and around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can memorize the photosynthetic
reaction, if you simply point the arrow
[SPEAKER_00]: the other way, you'll notice we have the
cellular respiration equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to take a general sense of
this, but we want to have a comparison
[SPEAKER_00]: because respiration occurs kind of in two
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aerobic, in the presence of oxygen,
there's also anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there's no oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aerobic is when there's oxygen present.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very efficient, produces a total of
38 ATPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: 36 are gained because there's a little bit
of an ATP investment there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The final products are water, carbon
dioxide, and 34 ATP molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be wondering, well, I just said
36 is what we gain for ATP, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the final product is 34.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of those ATPs come from the anaerobic
portion, initially started.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's aerobic, we're talking the
mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, our ATPs are adenosine
triphosphates.
[SPEAKER_00]: In anaerobic, without oxygen, we have very
low efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only gaining a total of two ATPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In plants, ethanol, carbon dioxide,
and four ATPs are produced, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: commonly called like fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here with the fermentation of
wine, our grapes into wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an anaerobic respiration process.
[SPEAKER_00]: In animals, we generate lactic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have sore muscles and feel that sore
muscles after a tense workout.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because your muscles went through
and generated lactic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an anaerobic process, and that acid
is what you feel on your muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like sore, and you're
stretching, and that's what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally a burning effect because
it's an acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: An anaerobic portion of respiration occurs
in the cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respiration of both types start out with
the same glycolysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glycolysis is the first step in the
breakdown of glucose to extract energy for
[SPEAKER_00]: cellular metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: No oxygen is needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This generates small amounts of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our glucose can be broken down into our
fructose, to our PGA, to our pyruvic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to get into all the details
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please realize that this is a very complex
sequence of steps that's involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pyruvic acid, which is without oxygen or
fermentation, does not yield much energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a take home message here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most is tied up at the end alcohol or the
acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethanol would be an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants convert ethyl alcohol or ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animals produce lactic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here's our ethanol with our
flora plant with waterlogged roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: and here's our muscles after a vigorous
exercise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're producing a lot of lactic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 7% of the energy in glucose molecule
is removed in a fermentation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only two ATPs gained.
[SPEAKER_00]: NAD plus becomes filled with florectins
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't make more ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would this even occur in the first
place?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of advantages in the
sense that glycolysis can actually occur
[SPEAKER_00]: very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can produce thousands of ATPs in a few
milliseconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't require oxygen because it can
occur in environments that lack oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This ability to drain ATPs quickly is
important when you have vigorous exercise
[SPEAKER_00]: because your muscles aren't able to get
oxygen efficiently enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to drain some energy,
your body is going to go through this
[SPEAKER_00]: glycolysis process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, the after effect is that acid that
is produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when in the presence of oxygen,
we have something called the citric acid
[SPEAKER_00]: or Krebs cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is aerobic respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: 39% of the energy is stored as ATP versus
only 7% with fermentation, so much more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: High energy yielding.
[SPEAKER_00]: 36 ATPs are gained for one glucose
molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: 602s are converted into 6 carbon oxides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, 6 water molecules are produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to balance our equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's high energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A nice little overview movie animation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to view that, you're more than
welcome to.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is showing just glycolysis,
pyruvic oxidation, the citric acid cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: and how these are all involved in aerobic
respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, for those who really want to know
about the citric acid cycle or the Krebs
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle and the complexities, this is an
image of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind because it is a cycle we do
see this kind of rotating event where we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to regenerate what we started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: For intensive purposes, I want you to know
just the general information about the
[SPEAKER_00]: respiration process.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, I'm not going to get into
all the specifics.
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
