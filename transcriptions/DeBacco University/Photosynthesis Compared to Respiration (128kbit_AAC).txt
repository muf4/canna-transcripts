[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at
photosynthesis compared to respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, photosynthesis occurs in the
chloroplast, respiration in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesis has the light-dependent
reaction and the Kelvin cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respiration is aerobic or could be
anaerobic cellular respiration,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's going to be using glucose and
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those then are being broken down into
carbon dioxide and water, which are needed
[SPEAKER_00]: by the photosynthetic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the general sense here, the comparison
between photosynthesis and respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesis assembles the sugars,
produces stored or potential energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respiration breaks down those sugars into
energy in releasing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cellular respiration and photosynthesis
are interdependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The glucose and oxygen produced by
photosynthesis are used in cellular
[SPEAKER_00]: respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The energy is transferred to generate ATP
with heat, carbon dioxide, and water is
[SPEAKER_00]: released as a waste product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carbon dioxide and water are then
available as raw materials for
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our light energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesis is assembling our sugar
molecule, C6H12O6, and kicking out oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's then being used by the process of
cellular respiration, breaking down that
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar molecule to generate ATP and heat
energy, and also carbon dioxide and oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: are byproducts, which are needed for the
photosynthetic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cycle then repeats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking specifically at a direct
comparison between the two, photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: only occurs in the light and occurs in
cells containing chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesis produces ATP with light
energy and uses carbon dioxide and water
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is thought to increase the weight of
the organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respiration, on the other hand,
occurs anytime, takes place in living
[SPEAKER_00]: cells, particularly the mitochondria of
those living cells, and it produces ATP
[SPEAKER_00]: with energy released from the sugar
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: This releases carbon dioxide and water,
and it's thought to decrease the weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're producing our photosynthetic
process with the light energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's producing that glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: That glucose is kind of that stored
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stored energy through the process of
respiration is broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing our ATP here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ATP is being used to do work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That work could be movement of motor
proteins, could be molecular transport,
[SPEAKER_00]: could be synthesis of biomolecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's given off as a byproduct is carbon
dioxide and water, which is needed for the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic process to occur and around
the cycle goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be able to understand and compare
and contrast both photosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_00]: respiration for some similarities and how
they're needed for biological systems and
[SPEAKER_00]: also some differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
