[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
I'll show you what bud rot or gray mold,
[SPEAKER_00]: also called botrytis, looks like on
cannabis plants as well as give you some
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas for identifying it and controlling
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the very end, I'll show you a plant
that was right in your harvest time that
[SPEAKER_00]: sadly was identified to have bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over how to identify
and control bud rot or called gray mold or
[SPEAKER_00]: botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, bud rot or botrytis provides
two most common names, also called gray
[SPEAKER_00]: mold, develops primarily in dense portions
of the plant, sadly such as the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: buds, and is favored by high humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gray mold growth can be seen as masses of
mycelium, which are basically fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: strands, and clusters of canidia,
which are asexual spores that are produced
[SPEAKER_00]: in large numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it starts internally to the bud,
this could be a very unwelcome surprise at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the season harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're going through and kind of
peeling back and trimming it, your buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could find that actual residual in the
center portion there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to do inspections ahead of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the life cycle of botrytis here,
this is shown on strawberry, but very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Botrytis is a disease in strawberries,
but the sources of this inoculum include
[SPEAKER_00]: infected leaves, well, sclerotia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Primary infections of flowers and
secondary infections of fruit are depicted
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind this botrytis species
looks like this on a closeup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about all these little kind of
branches that can easily break off and go
[SPEAKER_00]: and infect other portions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also what gives it that very fuzzy
like appearance because you literally have
[SPEAKER_00]: these like tree leaf branch like things
that occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see the canidia infecting the
fruit or infecting the flowers causing
[SPEAKER_00]: more infection, causing those to develop
into candeospores and going through
[SPEAKER_00]: mycelium, going through and affecting
causing repeated infections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in areas of high humidity,
which are typically in cannabis late in
[SPEAKER_00]: the season, this just encourages this
perpetuation of this life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you go about managing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, high humidity 90 plus for 12 hours
or greater is very favorable for botrytis
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physical damage can also increase odds of
botrytis getting an initial start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remove all trimmings and pruned plant
material offsite away from the plants as
[SPEAKER_00]: they may contain potential residual
spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: If identified in an area, remove the
infected plant material and then apply a
[SPEAKER_00]: control product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since this is commonly seen late in the
growing season, be aware of potential
[SPEAKER_00]: residuals and current and local
regulations for any product you're
[SPEAKER_00]: considering applying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, once identified, you may want to
harvest sooner rather than later to ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a good, some clean plant material
because some harvest is better than none.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's take a look at a bud rot that I
was able to identify in a late season of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now sadly when we're going through
investigating, this is something we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see a bud that's getting close
to finishing, but on this side here,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're seeing the evidence of some bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is typically caused by a species of
botrytis and this can spread very easily
[SPEAKER_00]: once you get in one area to other parts of
the plant, as well as other plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: you may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increasing air circulation and trying to
reduce the amount of moisture that's kept
[SPEAKER_00]: in there by sometimes just removing some
of the leaves here and trying to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: that chance that maybe some natural sun
could get in there can all help things as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see kind of once it gets into
an area, it can spread very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something we want to be
scouting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do see it, removing it as soon as
possible and then monitoring areas in and
[SPEAKER_00]: around this one particular bud here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this plant compared to some of
the others we've seen a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: stressed, a little bit more nutrient
deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see some more yelling to the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be for a variety of reasons,
but a little bit more stressed and sure
[SPEAKER_00]: enough, that's the plant that has one of
the buds at least that is starting to show
[SPEAKER_00]: this bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're suspecting the entire plant.
