[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we're looking at growing the
actual cannabis and getting to the final
[SPEAKER_00]: end result, that flower or those
cannabinoids can end up in many different
[SPEAKER_00]: end or final products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to go over just what a couple of
those are.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off is the obvious one, and that's
the flower, and that allows for actual
[SPEAKER_00]: inspection of the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it can have great variability
even if two dispensaries carry the same
[SPEAKER_00]: name and have different effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically the flower requires joints to be
used, which require rolling and some
[SPEAKER_00]: people enjoy, or pre-rolls as they take
the work out of smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in both these cases, the flower is the
actual plant produced product in its raw
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to something called hash,
which is a resin which is consumed by
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking a small apparatus, kind of
refining and getting away from the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: flower or end product of the actual plant
and transforming it into a different form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's edibles, which there's no
need to smoke the product, so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: commonly infused in gummies or candies or
other treats.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's an area of concern with
edibles, since I have the pictures here,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that miners can get a hold of them
since they look like normal products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other concerns with these are people
over consuming without realizing,
[SPEAKER_00]: since there's a delayed effect,
sometimes 30 to up to 60 minutes after
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they could consume, in this case,
one piece of cake or one brownie and then
[SPEAKER_00]: wait 15 minutes and say, well,
nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have another one and that really
there's a delayed effect in their effects
[SPEAKER_00]: after the consumption, particularly for
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: For CBD, you want to be careful and avoid
overdosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we want to be very careful and
treat this as medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's topicals, which are lotions and
balms, which are typically used for
[SPEAKER_00]: localized pain for a very specific area
and make for very easy application.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's concentrates or oils, which is a
broad category that includes, but it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: limited to, such as wax, shatters,
butters, or hashes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this allows is the chemical compounds
of the flour to be literally concentrated
[SPEAKER_00]: and made more consistently to allow for
more specific dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the vape pens, which offer
quick and easy usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main issue, though, is increased use
of miners using due to the ease of
[SPEAKER_00]: concealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very small, easy, and miners are getting a
hold of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very young ages and that's causing
a major issue.
