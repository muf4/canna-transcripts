[SPEAKER_00]: So here I would talk a little about
fluorescent lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there's many different types,
T5 high output fluorescents are typically
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the standard here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nice thin bulbs that produce a
nice high output and great if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at getting clones going or
starting seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're best suited, as I said,
for clones or seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're soft light that's not as intense
as other options that you may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be kept close to the plants one to
two inches away or if you're using T5
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially for maybe no more than six
inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not have a lot of excessive heat
produced so that's another advantage using
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescent tubes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: T5s are the most efficient fluorescent
option but tend to be more costly than
[SPEAKER_00]: some other fluorescent tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light temperature, so you might hear them
expressed in degrees Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2800 is considered a warm white for
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool white or sunlight is about 6500 K.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of get an appreciation for a
little bit of the variance that they do
[SPEAKER_00]: produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, since these are not good
flowering lights due to the lack of power
[SPEAKER_00]: produced, stick with the vegetative
spectrums if you select this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they're not great for flowering so
you want to stay away from the warm whites
[SPEAKER_00]: and you want to stick more to those cool
whites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluorescent tubes, typically 15 to 45
watts and 18 to 48 inches long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shopper work lights can work but they're
not the best option because they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: poor plant spectrum, that poor power
reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: T5 bulbs can be placed higher above the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about four to six inches because of
their increased in brightness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluorescents are well suited for shelving
or vertical farming options that we see
[SPEAKER_00]: here with lettuce production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reflectors are still important because you
want the light emitting everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it kind of concentrated and
focused directly below onto the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluorescents to have a ballast are
required especially for T5 lights due to
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality of light production and use of
cool running electronic valves also
[SPEAKER_00]: reduces the chance of that kind of
flickering that you may get with some
[SPEAKER_00]: lower quality bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind though that these bulbs do
contain mercury and other toxic metals and
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be disposed of properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just simply throw them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bulb life, so when you do get to that
kind of aged bulb, even though bulbs may
[SPEAKER_00]: not burn out, there is still a usable life
to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may need to be changed out even if
they're not considered to be dead as we
[SPEAKER_00]: see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bulb life is pretty long, about 20,000
hours which is about two years if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: running 24-hour hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is recommended that you do replace
these bulbs after about 15 months,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in actuality replacing them every 10
to 12 months when using 18-hour days is
[SPEAKER_00]: preferred just to get that maximum amount
to slow your plants so they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: stretching or getting light stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluorescent 2 manufacturer comparison,
Growhouse did an excellent comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: I provided you with a link here and link
at the bottom here, the PDF that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the exact same bulbs, different
manufacturers have very specific ballast
[SPEAKER_00]: and reflectors and this can make a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the links below and you can kind of
compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: While they are the same exact,
you know, general fluorescent,
[SPEAKER_00]: I might think you're comparing apples to
oranges here and the differences that they
[SPEAKER_00]: do get on some fixtures showing the
importance of the manufacturer's ballast
[SPEAKER_00]: and reflectors that they choose to use and
sell with their bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
