[SPEAKER_00]: When most growers see yellowing to their
leaves, their tomatoes, they often think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while that may be the case,
we have to look closely at those yellowing
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, these yellowing leaves are
very characteristic of an iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to look at this in tomato
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So iron, the plant importance,
and again, that yellowing, we want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: very specific of what we're looking at in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, iron is an immobile secondary
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's involved with many enzymes and some
pigments as well within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can see that that yellowing has
this characteristic green kind of veins
[SPEAKER_00]: with yellowing of in between those veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of people think they see
yellowing, they think nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while iron does aid the plant with
nitrate and sulfate reduction in energy
[SPEAKER_00]: production, this is very characteristic of
an iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that makes it very
characteristic is the location of the
[SPEAKER_00]: yellowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because iron is essential for the
formation of chlorophyll, this is why we
[SPEAKER_00]: see that loss of green color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in extreme cases here, we see that
yellowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that chlorosis is what we would
call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's particularly evident in the newer
leaves, the younger leaves, the upper
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what makes iron very
characteristic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron, there's another video on that,
and that will be in a different regions of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron is also more available in acidic pH
values, so that's below seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that the soil or media pH
is off, that can affect iron availability
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a trial was carried out in tomatoes
in a hydroponic setup in a greenhouse for
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent conditions, and allowed that
plant to receive the plethora of nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: that it needs, minus the one being
studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's the iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the control plant was filled with
balanced fertilizer, a complete kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: collection of nutrients, and the test
plant received everything except,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, iron being studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a characteristic iron
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice the overall lack of vigor that we
see in this plant overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, it's lack of vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if we look more closely at the
upper and newer leaves, they have poor
[SPEAKER_00]: green color.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a yellow look to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's simply because of the lack of
chlorophyll that's being able to form,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that newer growth, and simply due to
the restriction this plant has on the lack
[SPEAKER_00]: of iron that it has in its growing
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The older or lower leaves, in this case,
remain green color, but it's definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: that newer growth we're seeing,
that yellow, that chlorosis at the most
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's that same plant we saw there,
minus the iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a control plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that was fed a balanced fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the control plant has even green color
overall, very vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So vigorous, it kind of fell over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a key comparison here,
is that new growth is as consistent as the
[SPEAKER_00]: older growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, minus the iron, when we compare the
lack of vigor, number one, but we also
[SPEAKER_00]: have that newer growth being very yellow,
and the older growth being green,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do we correct an iron deficiency,
which hopefully we never see, but if we do
[SPEAKER_00]: see one, there's different forms of iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see we have a liquid, and here we
have kind of a soil applied one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chelated forms of iron are recommended
to help the plant use it very efficiently,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when there's a deficiency
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that plant's getting
iron fed to it readily, and it's readily
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I've just had some sample rates here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may vary in what product you do
purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do look at the recommended rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But kind of a starting rate, iron sulfate,
that's kind of the one here in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically it's soil test driven,
so it's not something you're just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: normally add.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically starting with about half a
tablespoon for two by two area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pros, it has sulfur added as well,
but the negative to that is that sulfur
[SPEAKER_00]: can actually lower the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be mindful if your pH is right where
you want it, and you add that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might be falling into an acidic
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chelated, a liquid iron, one ounce per
gallon, soil or foliar applications could
[SPEAKER_00]: be applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a liquid, so it can be applied to the
leaves, that's an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also sometimes contains other
micronutrients, which can be an added
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though the negative is it does require
repeated applications to be effective when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using the liquid product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's something you want to catch
very early, in those extreme cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: those leaves may never yellow up,
and that plant might be permanently
[SPEAKER_00]: stunted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this helps you identify,
if you see yellowing leaves, if they're at
[SPEAKER_00]: the top, you probably have an iron
deficiency.
