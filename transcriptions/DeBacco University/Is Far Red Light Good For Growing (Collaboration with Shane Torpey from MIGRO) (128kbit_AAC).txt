[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
we've got yet another collaboration here
[SPEAKER_00]: with Shane from MyGrow, this time
discussing far-red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it good for growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be giving you some background
information on exactly what is far-red and
[SPEAKER_00]: answering some of the common grower
questions such as, does it cause my plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to flower or how does it affect the
plant's morphology?
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned and hope you enjoy this
collaboration video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, welcome everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got Shane here from MyGrow breaking
apart all the lighting questions that you
[SPEAKER_00]: may have and getting to some more of the
details.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this video here, we're going to dive
into the effect of far-red light on plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to give you some background on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, define what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it different than red light?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do we actually need it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So first question, obviously, as we've
heard about red light, blue light,
[SPEAKER_00]: green light, previous videos, tied it into
PAR, tied it into lighting in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're kind of diving into far-red
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the obvious question is Shane,
what is far-red light?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the strict PAR range,
which is from blue to red.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from 400 to 700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we measure as causing
photosynthesis in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just beyond red, just beyond 700
nanometers, from 700 to 750 nanometers is
[SPEAKER_01]: where the far-red radiation is.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just about visible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it if there's a far-red LED,
for example, you would see a dull sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: red glow from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not quite up into infrared,
which is effectively radiated heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does cause photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as efficient in photosynthetic
terms as, for example, red.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does cause photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can also have an effect on plant
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mentioned a little bit there about
how is it close to red light, not quite
[SPEAKER_00]: infrared lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of in-between zone if you're
looking at wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does it differ than red light in
general there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you talked about a little bit of how
it changes the morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why should we be concerned about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in nature, far-red is effectively
reflected light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you are down in the canopy in
shade below, say, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: trees on a forest floor, or simply in
shade behind a wall in a garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount of far-red that the plant will
be receiving will be increased in
[SPEAKER_01]: proportion to if it's out of shade and in
direct sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason this is significant is the
plants have receptors for, they're called
[SPEAKER_01]: phytochrome receptors, but they have
receptors for detecting red and far-red.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they detect higher proportion of
far-red to red than in direct sunlight,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is telling the plant that it is in
shade and will trigger a response from
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the response from that plant is to
basically stretch, to grow to somewhere or
[SPEAKER_01]: to move to somewhere where it can get an
increase in light.
[SPEAKER_01]: In short, if you have a higher proportion
of far-red to red in your grow light
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum, you can cause plants to stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: This can be modified or moderated by high
proportions of blue, which, as we said in
[SPEAKER_01]: other videos, will reduce plant height and
cause short and dense growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: In summary, with regards to far-red,
there's a lot of excitement about it over
[SPEAKER_01]: the last year or two because it's
available in LED terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're quite efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're reasonably commercially viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're reasonably cheap to provide.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my view, they are less efficient
than the red, for example, from a
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis point of view, and also may
lead to plant stretching.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't recommend that you need a high
percentage of far-red or additional
[SPEAKER_01]: far-red in your grow light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Shing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a lot of talk, a lot of
questions about it, people seeking
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically out far-red because they
think, oh, it's more light, different
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths, going to give maybe different
profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different reactions for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just as you had mentioned there,
might want to stick a little bit more with
[SPEAKER_00]: the red light than the far-red light
because of that shade factor, perception
[SPEAKER_00]: of shade factor by those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indoor growing operations,
again, using the artificial lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stretching tends not to be grower's
friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is going to help induce more
stretching, that could cause some
[SPEAKER_00]: potential issues there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as mentioned before, look at some of
the other videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue light can have a counteracting
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, thank you for your insight on
this tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will allow growers to make educated
decisions on what they choose to go with
[SPEAKER_00]: in their operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two other small comments I'd make
about far-red.
[SPEAKER_01]: First is people have heard that maybe it
can cause plants to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be true in long day plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases, growers use far-red to
stimulate flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is a short day plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not relevant to cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one is that far-red can
cause leaf expansion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can cause more leaves and larger
leaves to grow relative to using lower
[SPEAKER_01]: levels of far-red.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that may be useful in terms of you
could use it, for example, in the early
[SPEAKER_01]: stages of growth, get that canopy built up
slightly bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've never seen any evidence to
demonstrate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would suspect that the benefits are
small or marginal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for providing that real world
connection there as far as what it might
[SPEAKER_00]: do and then what might be observed and are
going to use it, where it might be best to
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize it in the growth stage or cycle of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, love having this collaboration
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They provide growers with those fruit
insights so that they can hopefully choose
[SPEAKER_00]: to use it or know what they're getting
themselves into, what benefits they could
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially have, but what issues they
also might run into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
