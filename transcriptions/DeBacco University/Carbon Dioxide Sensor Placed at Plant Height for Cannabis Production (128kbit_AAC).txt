[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video,
where I'll be looking at carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor placement at plant height for
cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to be enriching your area
with carbon dioxide, you need some place
[SPEAKER_00]: to put the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens if you put it at plant
height?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at that investigation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, realize that carbon dioxide as
a natural material is heavier than air.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, it will have a tendency to
accumulate at the bottom of the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as we see here with the tanker that
had a leak of carbon dioxide, we see it
[SPEAKER_00]: filling the streets here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can still see the tops of the cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that carbon dioxide is heavier than
the air and it's going to disperse in that
[SPEAKER_00]: manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if the sensor reading offset,
so when placing a sensor at the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: height, this will typically result in a
reading that is most similar to what the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to have any sort of
offset idea of whether it's increased or
[SPEAKER_00]: decreasing from that reading you get is
determined to be most likely or an average
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation of what your plants will be
experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's the advantage of this
placement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this type of sensor placement is
advantageous if the carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: injection point is just below the actual
sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typical set of rain tubing, 12 inches
below the sensor placement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see an example of that rain tubing
here as well as kind of a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: indication of that going on here with
larger tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This simply allows the carbon dioxide to
fall and the sensor to pick up and
[SPEAKER_00]: determine the carbon dioxide level that is
what the majority of the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why you want it just above,
if this is my kind of CO2 injection point,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to actually fall down,
so it's going to go a downward direction
[SPEAKER_00]: with the sensor just above that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put it just below that,
what's going to happen, the CO2 is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to come out and go right to the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to get an idea of,
again, what that plant might be
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why this is an advantageous
location, particularly when using this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of rain tubing, which is this
multi-injection point around the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what I would suggest to growers is
that with this mounting location,
[SPEAKER_00]: since it's providing the most accurate
level of carbon dioxide concentration,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers should target the optimum level to
maximize plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also make sure that other factors are not
limiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to kind of artificially
increase or decrease the level you preset
[SPEAKER_00]: it at, since that is probably what the
plants are going to be experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dial it in to the right parts per million
that you're looking at having your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: at, and that's hopefully what your plants
will be experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And assuming no other limiting factors,
you should have an optimum rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery of carbon dioxide for your plants
in your enriched grow area.
Thank you.
