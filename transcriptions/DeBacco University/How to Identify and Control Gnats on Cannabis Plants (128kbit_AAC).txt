[SPEAKER_00]: This Tobacco University video is going to
look at the identification and control of
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus gnats related to cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's go over how to identify and
control gnats on cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start off with a description
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungus gnat larvae need wet conditions to
thrive and are typically found growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: the substrates and typically near the kind
of surface of those substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here the fungus gnat larvae,
how it looks, and then we see the adult
[SPEAKER_00]: gnat in the actual soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see one actually affixed to a
yellow sticky card which are used or hung
[SPEAKER_00]: in and around plants to capture insects so
that growers can identify or know what's
[SPEAKER_00]: in the area as far as pest pressure goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with that identification here we see a
large yellow sticky trap with all sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus gnats attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those yellow sticky cards can be helpful
for early detection however you can also
[SPEAKER_00]: use sliced potatoes placed near the soil
or substrate surface as it should only
[SPEAKER_00]: take about four to eight hours for maggots
if they're present to find the potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking for something that
you can just easily go maybe right in the
[SPEAKER_00]: kitchen and grab take some potatoes slice
them up put them near the plant and you
[SPEAKER_00]: should know very quickly if you have any
fungus gnat maggots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because the insects tend to feed on
the roots of the cannabis plant so placing
[SPEAKER_00]: it near the soil substrate structure will
put it near where they are and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: very likely to find this basic area here
to feed on as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we'll go about managing them so how to
go about managing fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well wet substrate surface is key to their
proliferation so sometimes putting a layer
[SPEAKER_00]: of sand or rice holes on the surface of a
container substrate will reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface moisture and thus result in less
fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping that real high surface moisture
very wet really increases the likelihood
[SPEAKER_00]: and pressure of your plants will have
fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general keeping that substrate surface
dry is important for their control so
[SPEAKER_00]: those rice holes or sand dry very easily
let water pour through very easily keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: that upper layer dry will reduce the
pressure of fungus gnats on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some do suggest applications of bacillus
thuringiensis or BT can be helpful but
[SPEAKER_00]: really that moisture is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last resort should be insecticides
that contain pyrethrum and neem oil as
[SPEAKER_00]: these need several soil based applications
and can also damage the plant roots as
[SPEAKER_00]: well so want to avoid those at all cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with the environmental change
reducing the moisture hopefully that will
[SPEAKER_00]: take care of your numbers especially if
you're able to identify them early.
