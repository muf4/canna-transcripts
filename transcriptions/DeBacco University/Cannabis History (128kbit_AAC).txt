[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to provide you with a
very brief history on the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also give you some resources where
you can kind of see a little bit more of
[SPEAKER_00]: the timeline or lineage for this
particular crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, cannabis, hemp in
particular, was used about 6,000 to 7,000
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Archaeologists found hemp fabrics in
northern China that date back to as much
[SPEAKER_00]: as 7,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: An interesting note, though, is that
evidence of hemp clothing only dates back
[SPEAKER_00]: about 2,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this difference in time supports the
idea that the main use of the plants may
[SPEAKER_00]: have been their psychoactive compounds and
not necessarily their textures or their
[SPEAKER_00]: fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either the properties were likely used in
either a medical standpoint or in a
[SPEAKER_00]: ritual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, at the bottom in some of the
slides, I have some links for some further
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did ancient people use cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the odds are very strong that yes,
they actually did.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 2,500-year-old stash of 13 whole
marijuana plants were unearthed in an
[SPEAKER_00]: ancient tomb in northwest China.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here, very clearly distinctly
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tomb where scientists found the
cannabis plants, you can kind of see the
[SPEAKER_00]: different layers, how they organized
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a close-up of the shroud,
a line drawing of the contents,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ultimately the bottom layer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see this shows kind of the
shroud and close-up view here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, very interesting that it dates
back that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: To kind of give you that overview,
NCR Labs has published a history of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis use, and there's this excellent
Google Doc link here to one of their
[SPEAKER_00]: sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We realize this is a publicly viewable
Google-based sheet that covers many major
[SPEAKER_00]: events worldwide from a
Massachusetts-based lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: In more recent history, details provided
that includes the day of the particular
[SPEAKER_00]: topic that's presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Links of sources, articles are provided
for each event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an excellent resource,
so I invite you to go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a look at that so you can brush up
and see some of the extensive history of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, mentioning the history, it'd be
remiss of me to not mention the Emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: Triangle, which is a region in northern
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the largest cannabis-producing
regions in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made up of three counties,
Humboldt, Modesto, and Trinity counties up
[SPEAKER_00]: here in northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivation started in the 1960s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became exponentially larger with the
passage of the California Proposition 215
[SPEAKER_00]: back in 1996, which legalized the use of
cannabis for medicinal purposes in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes this region in part so prolific
was its growing season matches or supports
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor growing of cannabis very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a long season near the ocean,
this also helps these counties become
[SPEAKER_00]: established as major cannabis producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fast forward to the Farm Bill of 2018,
where Congress federally legalized hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is defined as less than 0.3% THC
with the December 12th passage of the 2018
[SPEAKER_00]: Farm Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this translate to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the Farm Bill removes hemp from the
Controlled Substances Act and allows
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers to pursue federal hemp cultivation
permits while individual states can
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate the industry within their borders
as they see fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is seen as a major victory at moving
this forward and allowing an expanded grow
[SPEAKER_00]: of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what some are saying about the Farm
Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely world history.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Congress did is going to change the
future for the industry and the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes this so historic is that back
in 1937, there was a drafted bill that was
[SPEAKER_00]: implemented that basically made hemp
cultivation illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's exciting in 2018 and beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exciting to finally have defined
rules governing the sale of CBD products
[SPEAKER_00]: in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with hemp set to be treated as an
agricultural product, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: FDA or State Department of Agriculture
will provide oversight of the plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This now allows this potentially to take
off even more than it has already.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows states and the federal
government to be able to regulate it and
[SPEAKER_00]: treat it in a manner that will allow
people to grow it, to allow continued
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific research on this plant.
Thank you.
