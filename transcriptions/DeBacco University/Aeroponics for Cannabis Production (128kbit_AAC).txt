[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in learning about
aeroponics, this DeBaco University video
[SPEAKER_00]: will help you understand aeroponics in
more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at aeroponics for
cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, starting off with the basics of
aeroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And aeroponics basics are the plants are
grown while suspended in air with water
[SPEAKER_00]: and nutrients splashed or misted onto
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This system uses minimal water and
nutrients if done correctly with no
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in plant performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while there are commercial systems,
this kind of shows kind of a DIY kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: version here of what a grower kind of
constructed to create this aeroponics
[SPEAKER_00]: system just to show you how simple it can
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's now we're looking at the general
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's many different types,
all with the same premise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aeroponics involves a reservoir with a
nutrient solution and a raised planter
[SPEAKER_00]: bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are suspended in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see in this image up here and
typically do not make direct contact with
[SPEAKER_00]: the nutrient solution in the reservoir,
but have the solution delivered via a mist
[SPEAKER_00]: or supplied via a pump there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see the little spray jets
evident right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically plants are started in Rockwell
or other medium and then placed into the
[SPEAKER_00]: aeroponics system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the roots have some substrate to
initially start in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The system can be used for clones and
initially gets roots started for cuttings
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the advantages to this system,
as we can kind of see here, the pictures
[SPEAKER_00]: of the roots kind of speak for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you get roots that look like
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the advantage is the grower has full
control over the nutrients delivered
[SPEAKER_00]: directly to the roots of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Side to that is the grower has full
control of the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the grower needs to be on their game,
so to speak, with making sure they're
[SPEAKER_00]: delivering the right amount of nutrients
in the right concentrations where more is
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the system allows for aeration of
the root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water use is very efficient and
there's no need for growing medium,
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially maybe a little Rockwell to
beginning, eliminating this cost and also
[SPEAKER_00]: the disposal issue with a lot of growers
often forget about.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, no system is perfect,
so the disadvantages are due to the high
[SPEAKER_00]: level of control a grower has.
[SPEAKER_00]: This needs to be attentive so they may not
be the best option for new growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this system can perform great yields,
can perform great roots, but as I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: the grower needs to be aware of what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So new growers just getting started may
struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Careful monitoring is essential,
which allows for nutrient concentrations
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as pH values.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typical nutrient solutions are changed
every seven to 10 days and the system
[SPEAKER_00]: should be cleaned between growth cycles,
if not more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant life depends on the life of the
pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers need to be monitoring the pump
and ensure that they also have backups and
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity supplied to this type of
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be some upfront cost that may
be prohibitive to some growers who are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to implement potentially this
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The equipment just to kind of show a
little image of kind of general equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: is a container with a lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lid will have some form of plant
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside of the container water pump with
misting heads in this region here,
[SPEAKER_00]: a water monitor and of course a nutrient
solution to ensure the plants are being
[SPEAKER_00]: properly fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the targets for using this type of
system would be to have a continuous water
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to have that continually
monitoring that water and the levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: To start with, you're looking at a PPM
usually around 700, temperature of the
[SPEAKER_00]: water around 65 degrees Fahrenheit,
the pH around 5.5 to 6.5 with the target
[SPEAKER_00]: or ideal pH being 5.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these just provide you with some
general initial targets and you can tweak
[SPEAKER_00]: them from here as you see fit for your
cannabis growing operation.
