[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you may hear the term organic
compost teas tossed around a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I figured I should provide you with a
little background on exactly what these
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And teas, as we see here, as we think
about, may have in the morning or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, at brunch, a very similar
concept here to organic compost teas,
[SPEAKER_00]: but organic compost teas probably don't
want to drink those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're a liquid extract of a
solid-based compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the basic term organic teas here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put them in a tea bag, literally,
that allows water to come in, and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of developing a liquid extract of
what normally would be solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The benefits are said to be able to
supercharge liquid of microbes to your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, kind of taking the idea of what's a
solid form and creating a purified liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: form, which opens up your opportunities
for application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now while there are already many microbes
in the soil, an organic tea increases the
[SPEAKER_00]: rate of replication, kind of being the
ideal environment for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's little control over the
exact microbes that are being produced or
[SPEAKER_00]: replicated in many cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organic tea limitation is important to
realize this process doesn't create
[SPEAKER_00]: anything new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only provides an environment to allow
the naturally occurring microbes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: compost to multiply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not really developing anything
brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just kind of increasing what's
already there and developing it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: form that can be applied in many different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organic tea studies, the scientific
studies showing effectiveness are limited
[SPEAKER_00]: for organic compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: While Dr. Elaine Ingram is considered to
be the gold standard, there are few
[SPEAKER_00]: replicated studies that support many of
the claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just because you find one
article, you want to go through and find
[SPEAKER_00]: it from multiple sources so that you have
a good, not only a good understanding,
[SPEAKER_00]: but multiple sources to support that
particular common view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a brief overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that gives you just that basic
background of exactly what an organic tea is.
