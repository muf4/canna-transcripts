[SPEAKER_00]: Okay here we're going to be looking at
blood spider velocity pattern
[SPEAKER_00]: interpretation, meaning how quick was the
blood traveling and how is that going to
[SPEAKER_00]: look when it impacts a surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off there's blood spider velocity
classifications and just as a note F slash
[SPEAKER_00]: S is feet per second, M slash S is meters
per second as far as a rate goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low velocities classified mainly as your
gravity forces only, meeting velocity is
[SPEAKER_00]: like the force of a hammer swing,
and high velocity becomes shot producing a
[SPEAKER_00]: fine mist of blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off our low velocity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spot diameter is mostly between four
to eight millimeter range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common low velocity situations are free
falling drops due to gravity only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cast off, dripping, splashing,
or arterial spurting would all kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: fall under the classification of a low
velocity blood spatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This splash pattern, again a volume less
than one milliliter, subject to low
[SPEAKER_00]: velocity impact, could be thrown or
tipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visual characteristics include large
central irregular areas surrounded by
[SPEAKER_00]: elongated peripheral spatter patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of see here is an example of a water
drop and again all water are slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: different properties in blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you just an idea of what might
be occurring to develop a spatter pattern
[SPEAKER_00]: for blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of what it would look like in
a cartoon-like image in the sense of for a
[SPEAKER_00]: low impact velocity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a blood simulated squirted from a
syringe.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a height of one meter and this kind of
gives you again that low velocity kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: cast off like look to it and how things
may kind of be interpreted in that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a little zoom in version of that
and again this is all low velocity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see a lot of the blood staying
together, drops being very large.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case it almost looks slightly
raised as well from accumulation of blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a fair amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was five milliliters squirted.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of gives you an idea of that
kind of that cast off, that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: direction there, that kind of spattering
that has occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this again can be used for calculation
of convergence as well as many other
[SPEAKER_00]: things as far as determining where that
blood originated from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the arterial spurt pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is blood exiting the body under
arterial pressure because your heart is
[SPEAKER_00]: producing that pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your arteries in particular is having a
lot of pressure of blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well if there's a laceration that occurs
it can be an arterial spurt that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are large stains with a downward
flow and vertical surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wave form from pulsation flow may be
apparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that look like in this
extreme case here?
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be an example of arterial
spurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: This area here would be a spatter pattern
in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows that arterial spurt could have
been a laceration in extreme case say to
[SPEAKER_00]: the neck region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to medium velocity blood
spatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the blood source is subjected to medium
velocity impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again we're talking a little bit faster
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spot diameter is going to be smaller than
our low velocity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be mostly in the one to four
millimeter range because it's traveling at
[SPEAKER_00]: a quicker rate of speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the point of impact at 15
centimeters in front of a vertical target
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a six inch ruler for comparison
and looking here at a medium velocity
[SPEAKER_00]: blood spatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay and here we're looking at high
velocity blood spatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be producing a fine mist
with spot size less than 0.1 millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small mass limits spread to about one
meter and some large droplets can reach
[SPEAKER_00]: further.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is typically evident from like a
gunshot or this black spatter from an
[SPEAKER_00]: entry wound or the forward spatter from an
exit wound or as a result from high-speed
[SPEAKER_00]: machinery.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see here the difference visually
that that high velocity blood spatter
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now gunshot back and forth spatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have the gun being fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: That blood stained foam held just above
the target surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bullet passes from a left to right
just above the sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bullets traveling in this direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bullet enters the foam.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to exit the foam here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your back spatter entry and you
have your forward spatter to exit and this
[SPEAKER_00]: is ultimately where the bullets going to
end up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives you this idea of how there's
differences when it comes in initially
[SPEAKER_00]: contact with an object and how exiting an
object.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again this can be very important looking
at a wall or determining which direction a
[SPEAKER_00]: gun was fired or determining where it may
have impacted a particular surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gunshot at the back spatter here
originates from the entrance wound passes
[SPEAKER_00]: back towards the weapon and the shooter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seen only at close range of fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Areas to analyze would be inside the
barrel, exterior of the weapon,
[SPEAKER_00]: the hand, the arm, the chest of the
shooter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of shows you the black spatter
on a steadying hand and how fine the mist
[SPEAKER_00]: can be on that particular hand there
because this is again high velocity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gunshot forward spatter here
originates from the exit wound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have the impact of the object.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case we'll say it's the head of
the individual and then here we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of forward spatter here from the exit
wound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Passes forwards in the same direction as
the shot from the bullets traveling in
[SPEAKER_00]: this direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces more blood than the previous
back spatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be seen at any range of fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Investigate nearby surfaces such the
object, the person, especially the wall or
[SPEAKER_00]: area behind the victim if that warrants it
in the particular case that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: investigating.
[SPEAKER_00]: This high velocity blood spatter,
forward spatter and target is placed 15
[SPEAKER_00]: centimeters behind the point, high
velocity impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forward spatter the closest view here and
this kind of gives you that appreciation
[SPEAKER_00]: for those that fine mist that occurs and
the varying amounts based on the entry or
[SPEAKER_00]: the exit wound there.
