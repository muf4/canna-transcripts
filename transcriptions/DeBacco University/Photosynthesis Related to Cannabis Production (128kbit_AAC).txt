[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this DeBacco University video
where I'm going to go over photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: related to cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at some of the plant
physiology and relate it to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we have to understand the
basic equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the basic photosynthetic
equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any reactant and reactants here on the
left can be a limiting reactant as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: generating sugars and oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So carbon dioxide is easily a limiting
factor, especially during high light
[SPEAKER_00]: intensities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as growers to maximize plant
production, typically sugars, in the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to make sure the carbon dioxide,
the water and the light are not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be limiting as far as the plant is
concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the light component.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, we're looking here at the
visible light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look here, we can see all these
different wavelengths of light correspond
[SPEAKER_00]: with different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, the reds are the longer
wavelengths compared to the violets and
[SPEAKER_00]: the blues here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all measured in nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for plants, we're seeing some
increased importance with also the
[SPEAKER_00]: ultraviolet spectrum, as well as the
infrared, which are areas outside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: visible spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at a comparison spectrum,
this is a representative solar spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at basically the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the kind of we're looking here is
the output of the sun and what it produces
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as different wavelengths go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wavelengths are measured in
nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is sampled from 350 to 850 just to
give an idea of the representative solar
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at plants,
well, chlorophyll is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll in any form relates to the
green pigments found in the mesosomes of
[SPEAKER_00]: cyanobacteria and in the chloroplasts of
algae in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll is essential in
photosynthesis, allowing plants to absorb
[SPEAKER_00]: energy from light, taking that light
energy and ultimately going to go and
[SPEAKER_00]: convert it to chemical energy such as
sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll absorbs light most strongly in
the blue portion of the electromagnetic
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll absorbs light from the
electromagnetic spectrum as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: red portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't take that to mean that it's only
absorbing those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we see the green color,
it means it's reflecting green,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is some green light that is still
absorbed within plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conversely, it is a poor absorber of green
or near green portions of the spectrum,
[SPEAKER_00]: which it reflects, producing the green
color of chlorophyll-containing tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still absorbing some of that
green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two types of chlorophyll exist in
photosynthesis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are chlorophyll A as well as
chlorophyll B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking here, plants absorbing more
than just chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while chlorophyll does get a lot of
attention, we also have to take into
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration more than chlorophyll A and
chlorophyll B, there's also different
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds that are absorbing different
wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is allowing the plant, through
basically what's called an antenna
[SPEAKER_00]: complex, to utilize more of the
wavelengths of light that it's exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is helpful to the plant because
it's not just needing these finite little
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths, it's being able to utilize a
greater portion of the light it's exposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's that kind of utilization of
different wavelengths of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get my sources right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of gives you a nice little visual
comparison here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we're seeing that green light,
yes, it is absorbing less, but less does
[SPEAKER_00]: not mean, in this case, zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, you can see that
definitely in that bluer purple range and
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas that orange and red range,
we're seeing a greater percentage of
[SPEAKER_00]: relative response.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all wavelengths are being utilized in
some way with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a research article looking at
kind of the photosynthetic response here
[SPEAKER_00]: with variations with the photosynthetic
photon flux densities, abbreviated PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be important here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a great article if you want to
research it further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at cannabis,
because this is focused initially on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis here, is that cannabis is a high
light intensity plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunlight has a light intensity measured in
that photosynthetic photon flux density of
[SPEAKER_00]: 2,000 micromoles per meter squared per
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, is not economical to provide this
light level for an indoor operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is often given around 1,000
micromoles per second to aid in plant
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: In comparison, a low light intensity plant
such as lettuce can grow well in only 200
[SPEAKER_00]: micromoles per second squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that evident right here
where it almost grows, produces a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit larger leaves compared to the higher
light intensities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why it's important to try to
find research on the particular crop that
[SPEAKER_00]: is of interest of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that PPFD and temperature, how do these
kind of correlate or how do they kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: relate?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to take all environmental
conditions into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that for the abbreviation,
CI's internal CO2 concentration,
[SPEAKER_00]: CA's external concentration, looking
particularly at cannabis leaves here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the researchers found is that a
combination of 30 degrees Celsius in
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and 1,500 micromoles measured
with a PPFD may be best suitable for
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor cultivation of cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the cannabis sativa that
they were looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of gives you an idea of the
light intensity, but also the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: to maybe set as your targets if you're
looking at maximizing yield of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at light,
we also need to consider the light
[SPEAKER_00]: quantity and also the light quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So light quantity or DLI, which correlates
more with biomass and DLI is the daily
[SPEAKER_00]: light intensity that it's getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more light equals more plant,
at least following the biological curve or
[SPEAKER_00]: plateau.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a linear or an exponential
curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of this plateauing region
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light quality or color, which is a PAR
reading, impacts the morphology of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you give your plant more of the red
wavelengths, it has a tendency to stretch
[SPEAKER_00]: more, tends to more of just the blue
wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to stay more compact,
closer internode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see here that with light
intensity, photosynthetic rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: some areas can be light limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some can be carbon dioxide limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this all goes back to that
photosynthetic equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could hopefully see now how those
different components from an equation you
[SPEAKER_00]: may have learned previously now relates to
cannabis production.
