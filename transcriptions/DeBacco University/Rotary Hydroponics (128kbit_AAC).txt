[SPEAKER_00]: Now here we're going to look at rotary
hydroponics, which just as the name
[SPEAKER_00]: implies, applies a wheel that rotates
around a central light source here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's nutrient solution in the bottom
and this rotates through very slowly and
[SPEAKER_00]: allows the plants to get that full
exposure and doesn't need a reflector on
[SPEAKER_00]: that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's giving that 360 degrees of light for
the operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the ferrous wheel concept is kind of
the idea to think about when we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about these rotary systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to maximize space in light use
and a very small footprint ideally get a
[SPEAKER_00]: big yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the speed rotation is slow you can
still see it and I try to show that here
[SPEAKER_00]: where we can kind of see the world turning
but it's very slow in the rotation that it
[SPEAKER_00]: does.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same concept here as the
rotary form of hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall this is not well suited for
large-scale production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a good option for plants that
grow very tall because they're limited and
[SPEAKER_00]: as a result sadly this isn't very
practical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it may look really cool and
interesting we could see all the root
[SPEAKER_00]: systems here going right around and being
picking up that nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not very practical and if plants are
growing very tall they're going to run
[SPEAKER_00]: into the light and get tangled and then
cause all sorts of issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again very limited what it can be
produced for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does look kind of neat and does allow to
maximize a footprint but again not great
[SPEAKER_00]: for large-scale operations and really not
widely used.
Thank you.
