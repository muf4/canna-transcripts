[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to DeBaco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here, we're going to be looking at a
video lecture to determine the refractive
[SPEAKER_00]: index of glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now refractive index, abbreviated RI,
is looking at when light travels from one
[SPEAKER_00]: medium to another, its speed changes
relative to the density of the medium,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is observed as the light bends,
traveling from one medium to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: The speed of light, keep in mind,
in a vacuum is represented by the letter C
[SPEAKER_00]: and is always the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when light moves from one medium and
travels more slowly, as it goes to another
[SPEAKER_00]: medium, as it's constantly being absorbed
and re-emitted by the atoms in that
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the ratio of the speed of light in a
vacuum to the speed of light in another
[SPEAKER_00]: substance is defined as the index of
refraction, or refractive index,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's represented in equations as the
letter N for that substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look here, here's N,
this is going to be referring to the
[SPEAKER_00]: refractive index.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what does this actually look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, up here, we notice that when light
travels from one medium to another,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's bending, because we have a change in
the speed of that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's kind of a neat experiment here
is we have a glass with a piece of paper
[SPEAKER_00]: behind it with an arrow pointing in one
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fill that glass full of water and the
arrow actually flip the direction there
[SPEAKER_00]: because of a difference in refractive
index.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the refractive index and probability,
well, there's a database of refractive
[SPEAKER_00]: indexes for different types of glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this helps determine an appropriate
statistical probability that two pieces of
[SPEAKER_00]: glass share a common source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not offer that exact match,
but it can increase the probability that,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, it's very likely or unlikely,
a high probability or a low probability,
[SPEAKER_00]: that those two pieces of glass will match
one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how do we determine that refractive
index?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can use the submersion method.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just kind of a quick quote,
down and dirty method of determining this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You place the glass or fragments of that
glass into different liquids of known
[SPEAKER_00]: refractive indexes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the piece of glass and a liquid have
the same refractive index, the glass
[SPEAKER_00]: fragment will see to disappear when placed
in that liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is a prime example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a beaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: The liquid has the same refractive index
as this column in this test tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see everything appears to
disappear simply because of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: refractive index.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, they're kind of disappearing
because we don't have that difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between those two substances occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can also use a microscope,
a submersion along with a low power
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now submerged fragments of glass in a
liquid and then view them under a low
[SPEAKER_00]: power microscope using particularly a
compound light microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is great for small pieces or
small fragments that are found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, if the refractive index
of the liquid medium is different from the
[SPEAKER_00]: refractive index of the piece of glass,
a halo-like ring appears around the edge
[SPEAKER_00]: of that glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The halo-like effect is called the Beck
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking a little bit more detail at this
Beck line, you can kind of see an example
[SPEAKER_00]: of that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It appears because refracted light becomes
concentrated around the edges of the glass
[SPEAKER_00]: fragment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a Beck line is visible under a
microscope when the glass and liquid have
[SPEAKER_00]: different refractive indices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, in the middle image here
where they're both the same, Beck line's
[SPEAKER_00]: in the middle and they kind of all blur
together and they kind of merge and we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really see that Beck line
developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in this case, here we have the
perimeter of the piece of glass and we
[SPEAKER_00]: have the liquid being a lower refractive
index than the actual glass piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: This halo-like effect, if you look at the
perimeter of the glass, is located on the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of that piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, if the liquid has a greater
refractive index than the piece of glass,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have that same halo-like effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, the halo-like effect is
on the outside of the edges of the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important now to identify the
presence of a Beck line because that will
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you that there is a difference in
refractive indices between the glass piece
[SPEAKER_00]: and the liquid medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where that halo is found will tell you
which one is greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can help you determine the
approximate range of the refractive index
[SPEAKER_00]: for that piece of glass that you're
investigating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's some additional pictures showing
the refractive index of the medium versus
[SPEAKER_00]: the glass, that liquid versus the glass,
and that bending that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see kind of that rays are kind
of converging here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because the glass has a higher
refractive index and the Beck line is seen
[SPEAKER_00]: on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that right here on the inside
of that fragmented glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in this case is the opposite,
where the glass has a lower refractive
[SPEAKER_00]: index.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Beck line here is seen on the outside
of that perimeter there because the rays
[SPEAKER_00]: are diverging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes it a little bit clearer,
kind of that true little halo effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're seeing the evidence of that
clear outside, where that outside is and
[SPEAKER_00]: where's the halo occurring in relation to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's occurring on the inside,
as we see here, that means the glass has a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher refractive index.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here if that halo is occurring on the
outside of that glass, this is a sign that
[SPEAKER_00]: the glass has a lower refractive index.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's just some examples of
refractive index of known liquids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you had something or a piece of
glass that you thought what the refractive
[SPEAKER_00]: index was or for comparison, these are
some common liquids that can be used for
[SPEAKER_00]: that Beck line determination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now lastly here, we can look at tempered
versus non-tempered glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when trying to make a distinction
between tempered glass and non-tempered
[SPEAKER_00]: glass, particles process known as
annealing is used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And annealing is the slow heating and then
cooling of that glass that alters the
[SPEAKER_00]: microstructure of the material causing
changes in properties such as strength and
[SPEAKER_00]: hardness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Annealing alters refractive index value
for tempered glass greater than that of
[SPEAKER_00]: non-tempered glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can also act as a way for
determining that when we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing what the refractive index is for a
piece of glass.
