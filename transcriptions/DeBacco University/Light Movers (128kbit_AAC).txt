[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I know is popular with many
growers is the addition of light movers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it may not look exactly like this,
the concept is the same, where they have
[SPEAKER_00]: lights on the rail and they're moving that
across the plants there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the basics are it can kind of
be like this gantry system where we have
[SPEAKER_00]: the light there is on a rail, the light
mounts and allows it to easily move
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole purpose of this is to mimic kind
of the traveling of the sun for the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to increase the amount of angles that
those plants are getting light exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the benefits is it reduces the chance
of a hot spot or burning the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: because that light is moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows plants to cool down and the
lights can be placed closer to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can increase the penetration and
angle of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's kind of mimics the sun
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of gives that light some exposure
from different sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all well and good.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we have to consider the drawbacks
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it depends on a motor which can fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one very important aspect is
that the electric motor moving that light,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, that can fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not necessarily increase the area
you can grow in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers think that you can reduce the
amount of lights in the same area and this
[SPEAKER_00]: is not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people think, oh, if I just take one
light and I move it across this area where
[SPEAKER_00]: I would normally put a bunch of other
lights, I don't have to use those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sadly, that's not the case because
there's no replacement for the area
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage by a single light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your average thousand watt high pressure
sodium is covered about a five by five
[SPEAKER_00]: area where whether you move it or not,
it's only covering that five by five area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the angle of the light is being
changed and not necessarily the intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: over a grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, important to consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally am not a fan of light movers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel you just have the lights and you
can add different spectrums of lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all well and good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving the light, to me, there's just too
much potential that could go wrong and I
[SPEAKER_00]: see very little gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I choose not to use them
for micro operations.
