[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be looking at carbon
dioxide enrichment levels and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this beginning picture may show rice
is also a C3 plant, much like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to develop some conclusions
and we're looking at enrichment levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is more always better?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at just a picture here of the
rice, we can see 400 or about 390 to 400
[SPEAKER_00]: is considered to be atmospheric or normal
carbon dioxide levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see how there is a difference
in rice production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely as we go below that,
we see it kind of dwindling off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And above that, we are seeing an increase
in yield or at least in biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does this apply to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, if we're looking at what
level we want to keep our plants at,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first consideration is basically
atmospheric levels, which is about 400
[SPEAKER_00]: parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is offers the advantage of no
additional equipment would be needed if
[SPEAKER_00]: you were looking at enriching your plants
with 400 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply want to just keep air circulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is this can limit yields
to whatever the atmosphere is able to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're in a closed growing area,
you definitely want to make sure you're
[SPEAKER_00]: moving air around because there is a
chance that 400 parts per million that is
[SPEAKER_00]: normal atmospheric levels in your growing
facility, it could be lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what if we enrich to the 400 to 800
part per million range?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the advantage is increasing yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this does start to require
specialized equipment, even in the 400 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 800 part per million range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about 800 to 1200 parts per
million?
[SPEAKER_00]: If a little is good, why don't we just go
a little bit more?
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage is this can also or still
increase yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can use a lights that produce a greater
intensity as well to take advantage of
[SPEAKER_00]: this increased carbon level.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantages is the cost of the
equipment and actual the carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you're going to be using or
producing it in the sense that as you get
[SPEAKER_00]: higher levels, it's going to require more
and more carbon dioxide to be added to
[SPEAKER_00]: your growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the upper end of the
range, 1200 to 1600 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the advantage is that it ensures
carbon dioxide will not be limiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantage, it will have
the highest cost simply because you are
[SPEAKER_00]: adding a high dosing level from a plant
standpoint of carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to weigh all these different
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: What range of carbon dioxide levels are
you going to keep your plants at?
