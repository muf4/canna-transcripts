[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
we're looking at the importance of testing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant material for pesticide
residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into testing cannabis
plant material for residues of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, here's our research article,
role of mass spec in cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to highlight some of the information
presented here, but always welcome to take
[SPEAKER_00]: a look at this in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pesticide concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, pesticide residues have become a
significant problem for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry because the final product can be
concentrated or burned, resulting in
[SPEAKER_00]: alterations that are not typically
associated with other plant materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, the levels of pesticides and
herbicides should be very low or absent in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis final end product plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, this is not only an
outdoor problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think pesticides,
oh, it's for outdoor grown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this also can be applied to the
controlled indoor environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: are still subject to insect, bacterial,
and fungal pests that can negatively
[SPEAKER_00]: impact plants, which could warrant the
application of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to the threat of plant loss,
the use of pesticides is of increased
[SPEAKER_00]: temptation by growers to ensure that
they're not going to lose the crop and all
[SPEAKER_00]: the money and time that they've invested
in that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people go to it organically
grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, organic does not necessarily mean no
spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Numerous detections of low to moderate
levels of pesticide contamination,
[SPEAKER_00]: tens of parts per billion or less from a
number of growers claiming to use organic
[SPEAKER_00]: or clean green growing methods prompted
investigation of possible sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So organic does not mean pesticide free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic means typically that there is a
smaller list of products that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: applied and still qualify the resulting
plant material as organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, reliable chemical analysis is
important when we're looking at testing in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reliable chemical analysis of plant
material before it's consumed is important
[SPEAKER_00]: to ensure the absence of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis tested with confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, pesticide tolerance when we're
looking at other materials is definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apple, beef, egg, grape, hops,
and milk here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're seeing the microbutanol,
which is an active ingredient in EGLE-20.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a broad spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's considered slightly hazardous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have imiproclay, which is an
insecticide found in a brand name called
[SPEAKER_00]: Marriott.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's considered to be moderately
hazardous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the comparisons of those two in
these different crops here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see the marijuana extracts here
looking at an idea of some of the changes
[SPEAKER_00]: that occurred in comparison to some other
crops as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, important to understand
pesticide tolerance levels for different
[SPEAKER_00]: state regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to appear on the
analytical report as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's use that microbutanol just as a
quick example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbutanol is the most prevalent
pesticide detected and is most commonly
[SPEAKER_00]: used for the treatment of mold
infestations, which sadly can be very
[SPEAKER_00]: common in cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbutanol is a fungicide that when
present in cannabis plant material is
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked via a cigarette, it is released via
toxic gas, hydrogen cyanide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why it's so of a high level of
concern in cannabis simply because when
[SPEAKER_00]: ignited, it's creating this hydrogen
cyanide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It itself doesn't contain hydrogen cyanide
because that's a gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you vaporize it, that induced heat is
causing a change in the chemical structure
[SPEAKER_00]: to hydrogen cyanide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very high level of concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, state by state lists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, keep this in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check your local state regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each state has its own list for pesticides
which must be monitored in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: California, for example, currently has a
list of 66 pesticides which must be
[SPEAKER_00]: monitored where 21 in the list are in
category one and should not be detected in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis products, while the other 45
pesticides in category two should not
[SPEAKER_00]: exceed indicated action levels at low
parts per billion, PPP, lower limits of
[SPEAKER_00]: quantination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, knowing where that kind of
falls, what pesticides fall in what
[SPEAKER_00]: category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at the distribution of
clones, passing or failing California
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide action limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green equals passing, red equals failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the number of clones tested
that passed or failed proposed California
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide threshold from market entity in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The portion represents red as graph is the
total failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 77.4 failed, 22.6 did pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also where we get into that kind of
gray area of if they're grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: California and shipped to somewhere else,
will that impact whether they fail or they
[SPEAKER_00]: pass?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's looking at California produced
clones with California limits here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, cannabis chemical complexity so
separation, the use of mass spec are
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical methods that can help handle
these complexities of the plant and also
[SPEAKER_00]: low parts per billion levels required by
state regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other analysis have been employed in the
past for measuring some pesticides but
[SPEAKER_00]: typically your mass spec techniques tend
to be the ones that are in generally
[SPEAKER_00]: preferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's gas chromatography and there's
liquid chromatography here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little comparison between the two here
with that kind of mass spec chromatography
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the specifics here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little different kind of processes but
still getting those results here at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end for comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now suggested techniques just in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at all the options.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many cases, pesticide levels are in the
mid to low parts per billion range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is looking at liquid
chromatography mass spec approach may be
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those samples containing very low
parts per billion levels of unknown
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides and may be preferred to employ
some of these techniques in high
[SPEAKER_00]: resolution mass spec employing this orbit
trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also you can see here a recent
webinars looking at this importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, looking at kind of getting this
information out and seeing and evaluating
[SPEAKER_00]: these different testing techniques to make
sure labs are utilizing the most efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: ones possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at these techniques for
pesticide detection here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not getting into too much of the
details but we can clearly see that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of availability to test
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, most state laboratories
including New York State suggests the
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid chromatography mass spec techniques
for quantitative determination of
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides and cannabis hemp and products
derived from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind this goes beyond of just
the actual dry flower material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any products derived from them should also
be going through this same level of
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This technology coupled with recommended
sample preparation provides broad coverage
[SPEAKER_00]: with high sensitivity and also selectivity
for the quantitative determination of over
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really allows a very efficient way
to detect any presence of those pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: on the plant samples submitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lastly, challenge of pesticide testing
just in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inherent challenge is that if the
pesticide is not tested for it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: present but simply not identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, having cannabis plant material
testing for the likely pesticide used is a
[SPEAKER_00]: very important step if it is just an
initial step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumers should be ensuring any product
they're considering purchasing has the
[SPEAKER_00]: proper testing and this documentation is
checked before buying and using that
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because they can't test for
everything they're testing for a good
[SPEAKER_00]: subset of those samples and your proposed
material passes all of those samples can
[SPEAKER_00]: be a good indication at least for
pesticides that that sample is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind there's other testing such as
heavy metals and mycotoxins that should
[SPEAKER_00]: also be taken into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a look at educating you on
the specifics of pesticide testing in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
