[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to go over the cut and
stick method of cannabis cloning and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully some tips and tricks to make
sure if you're trying this method,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are successful at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the cut and
stick method for cannabis cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, we want to make sure we
have the necessary materials to be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with cloning, or vegetative propagation
in general, healthy mother or stock plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is important regardless of what method
we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely for this method as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have a growing substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have a rooting hormone method
of labeling and documentation in a
[SPEAKER_00]: favorable propagation environment so that
growing substrate can be variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will choose oasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people choose root riots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people choose rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people choose sands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people choose soilless media.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those can work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rooting hormones, so the example here of
Clonex, there's many other different types
[SPEAKER_00]: of rooting hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them tend to fall into the category
of the plant hormone oxen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a proper method of labeling and
documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see the labels labeling the
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want to have a backup for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No excuse to be taking clones and forget
which one was which, have redundancies
[SPEAKER_00]: within your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also a favorable propagation
environment to encourage those clones that
[SPEAKER_00]: are going through a stressful time to go
through and root well so they can be
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred to the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what does the environment look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's just some examples here of
getting into what the kind of environment
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be shooting for or aiming for,
your targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, your temperature,
78 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit or 25 to 28
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture level around 90% relative
humidity at least to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to be decreasing that as the
clones are progressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then light levels, 200 to 350 par
reading approximately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diffused light is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they are going through kind of
that stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically I do not recommend cutting the
leaf tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to remain and keep the leaf tips
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually can help increase the odds of
your rooting success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another video on that on this channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here we can see just the general
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for 90%, how do you know you're
approaching 90%?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're using a humidity dome,
there should be moisture on that dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that substrate that I had mentioned,
you want to take the cutting that's about
[SPEAKER_00]: six to 10 inches long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go shorter, but that's a good kind
of healthy clone, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to apply a rooting hormone,
and then you literally stick it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: media.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where this gets its name,
the cut in the stick method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I said that humidity dome,
you could use a large humidity dome over
[SPEAKER_00]: an entire tray, or you could simply invert
a clear cup here to increase the humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: around that clone, particularly on the
early portion of the rooting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this, if you're looking at
propagating canvas clones repetitively
[SPEAKER_00]: with this cut and stick method,
hopefully this will provide you with some
[SPEAKER_00]: basic information to increase your odds of
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
Thank you.
