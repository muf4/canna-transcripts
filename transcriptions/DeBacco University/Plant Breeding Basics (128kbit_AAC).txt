[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over the very
basics of plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost, there's kind of two
ways to look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the traditional way, which is what
I'm going to focus on here, where you have
[SPEAKER_00]: a donor variety strand and a recipient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of getting that mix of that
new variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have genetic engineering,
which is where we're taking these very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific desired gene and very precisely
inserting it into the DNA sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is still breeding as you are still
producing a new individual, but in this
[SPEAKER_00]: case, they're very directed and only
producing that desired gene being
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditional is kind of that many genes are
transferred and the hope is that desired
[SPEAKER_00]: gene will carry over, and here's that
desired gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope that desired gene is carried over,
but there's also going to be some other
[SPEAKER_00]: carryover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic engineering is going to take just
that desired gene and only insert that
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to, again, focus a little bit
more on the traditional breeding here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pure breeding lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is established lines that come true
from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order for this to happen, there needs
to be a limited amount of variation and
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced amount of heterozygosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetics need to be either homozygous
dominant or homozygous recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is different than clones because
clones are taking the same plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're having a male and female.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having a cross breeding that's
occurring, but essentially all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there would not be high variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the X over the puppies here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure breeding lines is always going to
kind of come true from type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever you get in the parents,
you're going to cross two parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be very similar,
and you're going to get basically the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing as a result.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get different colors,
different splotches, different coat
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's other terms used.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just crossing, selfing,
and sieving.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are common terms used within growers
and used when they're generating seeds or
[SPEAKER_00]: generating crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first or obvious one is cross
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is simple breeding of two different
varieties together, and this can create
[SPEAKER_00]: the highest degree of genetic variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a homozygous recessive green
color p-pod, and here we see a
[SPEAKER_00]: heterozygous p-pod with yellow being
dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cross these together and we see the
variability that we get not only in
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype, how they look, but also in
genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can kind of see the same thing down
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at our Punnett Square.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two purple flowers, both
heterozygotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both contain this other recessive
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we breed these together, we get 75%
or three out of four phenotypes will be
[SPEAKER_00]: purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: One will have a white phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the genotypes, one is
homozygous dominant out of four.
[SPEAKER_00]: One out of four will be homozygous
recessive, and two will be heterozygotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that this will always produce
the purple gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's bred with another homozygous
dominant, all their offspring will be
[SPEAKER_00]: considered pure breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same goes for the pure breeding white
here where the homozygous recessive,
[SPEAKER_00]: these, though, create a little bit more
variability just as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, phenotype, genotype,
cross-breeding will kind of create the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest degree of the variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something called sulfin.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the name implies, it's taking pollen
and fertilizing the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in cannabis, because they're
monaceous, this is very difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the concept of kind of getting
that feminized seed, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sulfin in general, as you see here
with the lily flower, this restricts the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic variability of the offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You simply have the male pollen
fertilizing the same female here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to limit the genetic
variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sibbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is taking two seeds from the same
plant, and that's the same individual
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, and using one plant for pollen and
the other for the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a way to create a small amount of
variability because they both came from
[SPEAKER_00]: the exact same original plant in the
offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting some variability,
but not a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of if you're looking at maybe
refining something or selecting for
[SPEAKER_00]: something more specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's a hybrid?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used corn as the example,
because hybrid corn is probably pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: well known and understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hybrids are botanically different as an
offspring from two plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: different species or varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this actually does, what a hybrid
does, it creates a mixture of genetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: is often the result of some
cross-breeding, depending on what plants
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically cross-bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this kind of mean in an
example?
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see these two different corn
plants that were cross-breeding together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one produces very small kernels.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one produces very large kernels,
but it's kind of a smaller cob itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can cross-breed these two and develop a
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This hybrid has larger kernels,
but more of this longer shape to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe has a greater area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the result.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of seeing evidence of both of
the parents resulting in the offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into something called F1
hybrids, and this is hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's thought to produce seeds or plants
that are 25% bigger than either parent
[SPEAKER_00]: alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how is an F1 hybrid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is this accomplished?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, by developing two distinctly stable
breeding lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have violet and white flowers for
obvious examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would self-cross these for about seven
to nine generations, and self-across white
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers in this example for seven to nine
generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: After we have these two isolated
generations, we breed them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would cross these together to ideally,
hopefully, create the best of both worlds
[SPEAKER_00]: in the resulting F1 offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this kind of look like in
real life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is kind of a nice example here
that I found where you're seeing seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: offer hybrid vigor, which can not be
obtained directly from a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hybrids are created by crossing two true
breeding parents to produce F1 seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: can grow more vigorous than each parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see parent one on this side,
parent two on this side, and these are
[SPEAKER_00]: corn plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the hybrid here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see as we go through this time
lapse, showing the progression,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see that this plant here tends to
produce bigger and better than either of
[SPEAKER_00]: the lines that it was used to breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this isn't growing to full
terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing for about a little over 30
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see even from the beginning,
the wider leaves, the bigger plant than
[SPEAKER_00]: either of the offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just interested to see how
hybrid vigor can play out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something you cannot get from
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, here's something called the F2
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is further generations are just
continuations of the original breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: lineage, and it's tracked through a family
tree or pedigree.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall is the resulting F2
generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Offspring may vary greatly from the F1
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take a pure breeding line,
a pure breeding line, kind of self that
[SPEAKER_00]: for seven to nine generations,
we get our hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if we plant that seeds from that
F1 generation, we could get something that
[SPEAKER_00]: may revert back to one of the original.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever have some hybrid plants or
hybrid tomatoes that you grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've saved the seeds, you may get
offspring that look nothing like the
[SPEAKER_00]: original because it's reverting back to
one of the original generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
