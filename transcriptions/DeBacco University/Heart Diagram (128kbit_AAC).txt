[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to go over the heart
diagram and how it does not look like the
[SPEAKER_00]: image pictured here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest you get a clean sheet of paper
out and a pen or pencil, so I want you to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to draw a heart diagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go over kind of the,
it may seem like an awkward way we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to draw it, but I think it'll make
more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with just to get you familiar
with the simple heart diagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of the basic components you
should be familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The atrium, the ventricle, some of the
valves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I asked you to draw this, it's a little
bit difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: The orientation, where everything is
located.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're going to focus on for our
sketch or our drawing is not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: an atomically correct picture of the
heart, but a square heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is kind of a square heart
diagram, so I think these are very helpful
[SPEAKER_00]: in the sense of understanding exactly how
things look and where things are located.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll draw your attention to this image
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see on the left-hand side here,
RA and RV.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might think, well, didn't they label
this wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't this the left side?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this the right atrium?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this the right ventricle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's simply because we're looking
at oriented in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be the right side of the body
and the left side of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from our perspective, looking at the
square diagram, this would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: deoxygenated, this left-hand side would be
the deoxygenated side, or the right side
[SPEAKER_00]: of the heart would be deoxygenated.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left side of the heart is the
oxygenated blood, and that's indicated in
[SPEAKER_00]: the red here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top here is our pulmonary circuit
going to the lungs, and here's our
[SPEAKER_00]: systemic going to the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with that right atrium,
that is receiving blood from the body,
[SPEAKER_00]: the deoxygenated blood from the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where blood is first entering at
that right atrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's then passing to the right ventricle,
where then it's going to be pumped out to
[SPEAKER_00]: the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see our blue line becomes our red
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our deoxygenated blood becomes red,
even though in real life, it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: different shades of red.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that blood comes back from the
lungs, it's entering the left atrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: From that left atrium, it's going down to
the left ventricle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This chamber of the heart has the greatest
amount of muscle, because this left
[SPEAKER_00]: ventricle needs to pump blood out to the
entire body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got our right atrium going to our
right ventricle, going to then the lungs,
[SPEAKER_00]: coming back from the lungs to the left
atrium and into the left ventricle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to make this a little bit
more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That blood that's coming into the right
atrium, well, that's coming in the vena
[SPEAKER_00]: cava, so we want to label that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's getting passed to the right
ventricle.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it leaves the right ventricle,
it is going to the pulmonary artery,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's entering the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: After it gets oxygenated in the lungs,
it returns to the pulmonary vein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, arteries carry blood away,
from the heart, veins carry blood towards
[SPEAKER_00]: the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is oxygenated blood coming back into
the heart at the left atrium, then getting
[SPEAKER_00]: past the left ventricle and going out the
aorta to the rest of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one last thing I want you to make note
of and add to your square heart diagram
[SPEAKER_00]: are the valve names.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want you to back here for a second
from our right atrium to our right
[SPEAKER_00]: ventricle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to label this as the tricuspid
valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after the blood leaves the right
ventricle, heads to the lungs,
[SPEAKER_00]: before it goes out the pulmonary artery,
it has to pass through the pulmonary
[SPEAKER_00]: valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that gets oxygenated, comes back in
the left atrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it travels from the left atrium to the
left ventricle, it goes through the mitral
[SPEAKER_00]: valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: From that valve there, before it plumps to
the rest of the body there, up the aorta,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has to go through the aortic valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you have the atriums the
valves, and also the proper veins and
[SPEAKER_00]: arteries labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a square heart, I find that's the
most easiest way for students to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have this completed, you should
be able to look now at this image,
[SPEAKER_00]: the heart detailed image, and start to be
able to put together all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: components there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to make note that the atrial
ventricular valve here is sometimes that
[SPEAKER_00]: is what it's called here.
[SPEAKER_00]: See our tricuspid valve and the mitral
valve here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do kind of go by two names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a little easier to tell them
apart than the tricuspid here on the right
[SPEAKER_00]: atrium and the right ventricle,
and the mitral between the left atrium and
[SPEAKER_00]: the left ventricle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this is helpful in starting to
understand the complexities of the four
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber heart, and the pathway blood takes
through the heart as it receives from the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of the body, goes out to the lungs,
comes back in the lungs after it's
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygenated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's sent out the aorta to all of the
necessary components of our body.
Thank you.
