[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at cannabis physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a lot of times people think
physiology, they think, oh, it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: physical parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is having to do with kind of how the
plant works or the interior components of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, just plant physiology in
general takes into account a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant morphology is actually how the plant
looks in the basic structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physiology takes that into consideration
along with cellular interactions,
[SPEAKER_00]: look in cellular biology, and a bunch of
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So specifically, physiology is the study
of the functions of organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of tries to explain a little bit
how they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some key physiological processes in plants
that I'm going to talk about are tropisms
[SPEAKER_00]: and gnastic movements, hormones,
photoperidisms, pigments, transpiration,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant diseases, and also the very
important photosynthetic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, tropisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growth in response to a stimulus is an
example of the plant bending towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be a phototropism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And roots growing down, that's a grab of
tropism, plants responding to gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gnastic movements are kind of showed here
in this aegis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's plants moving in response to
environmental stimulus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The direction of the movement may or may
not be correlated with the stimulus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this is a sensitive plant,
mimosum.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, someone poked the end here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see kind of all of the resulting
effects here of the plant's folding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants do this, or this plant particularly
does this, to try to reduce impact from
[SPEAKER_00]: herbivores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we have seen a Venus flytrap that,
you know, will close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of the same example of a
gnastic movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant hormones are chemical substances
that regulate plant cell processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can produce a significant response
despite extremely low concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some key ones I'd be familiar with,
abscisic acid, oxygen, cytokinins,
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene, and gibberellins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go into these in detail in
other lectures, but this just gives you an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea, or at least familiarize yourself
with some of these common plant hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photoperidism is response to a change in
day length, though more accurately
[SPEAKER_00]: described to be stated as response to the
change in continual length of night,
[SPEAKER_00]: time of uninterrupted darkness over a
24-hour cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have heard of some plants called short
days or long day conditions, in the summer
[SPEAKER_00]: or the winter, kind of based on the tilt
of the earth and how that affects things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photoperidism is very important for
cannabis because it can signal to either
[SPEAKER_00]: produce more leaves, put it into a
vegetative state, or produce flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: which call, you know, the flowering
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can, some cannabis plants,
depending on the hours you give them,
[SPEAKER_00]: will change the various habits or
morphology that they take on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pigments are important, such as
chlorophyll would be one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main purpose of pigments is to aid in
the photosynthetic process by increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: the total amount of light that can be
captured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll is the most predominant
pigment, which gives leaves their green
[SPEAKER_00]: color.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that indented right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other pigments are called anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're purple pigments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're classified as flavonoids,
and they impact wavelength of light that's
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purple kust, purple haze, purple
skunk, all these have increased amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: anthocyanin, or increased amount of purple
coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of see that purple coming through
here, this maturing flower bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different ones will have different
colorations, but some of those colorations
[SPEAKER_00]: are related to the pigments, in this case,
anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transpiration is a very important plant
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a process which carries water from
the roots of the plant to the shoots and
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately out the leaves as water vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this helps the plant move water and
nutrients dissolved in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since plants don't have blood,
they're kind of using this water,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of absorbing the roots and shoots,
finding minerals to be dissolved in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing it to cool itself also.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's its number one task.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cooling process, even though some
is used for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rate of transpiration, or the rate
that water's moved through here,
[SPEAKER_00]: is dependent on a couple of factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's directly related to temperature and
sunlight intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see as temperature increases to
a certain point, but as temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: increases, so does transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it cool in itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wind velocity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, as we increase the wind,
we're increasing the amount of water that
[SPEAKER_00]: is being evaporated out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's indirectly proportional to the
humidity levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see as our humidity increases,
our transpiration rate will decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is simply because if there's more
moisture in the air, there's no place for
[SPEAKER_00]: that water vapor in the leaf to go
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about if you're ever in the
summertime, it's really humid and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stick to like the car seat or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just feels like clothes stick to you
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because there's a very high rate of
humidity, very high rate, not allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: water to evaporate well into that external
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also plant disease, which is a
very broad topic, but in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an infection that can alter the
physiology of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though plants do not have white blood
cells like we do like in our immune
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, they still have defense mechanism
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see a cannabis plant with
powdery mildew on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesis is the last step here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a complex process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It uses light water and carbon dioxide to
process or produce sugar molecules and
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen as a byproduct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understanding this process can help
improve the quantity and quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that is harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it's presented as very quick and
easy here, understanding this,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially with artificial lighting,
can really change the quality of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: that will be produced by a grower.
