[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, when growers are looking at applying
fertilizers, they typically want to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: in an efficient way.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times this can lead to growers
wanting to mix fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to keep in mind,
fertilizers do interact with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be a positive interaction,
as we see with these gears, or it can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: negative interaction, and we want
everything working together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as interactions, mixing different
fertilizers, a lot of growers do it
[SPEAKER_00]: because it can save time, and that's a
great advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's also the possibility of
some unwanted interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beneficial to only take mix certain
nutrients to reduce the chance of negative
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our example here, if we're looking to
produce color, we mix all three together,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to get, in some case,
white, but we're not producing one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: three colors here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind those interactions can be
beneficial, but they can also be negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep the amount of fertilizers you're
mixing together minimal because you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the chance of having unwanted
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, certain fertilizers cannot be tank
mixed, but spacing out applications in
[SPEAKER_00]: spoon feeding plants is more advantageous
to the growth cycle anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a lot of times if you read
labels, they'll say perform a jar test,
[SPEAKER_00]: if there are questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what a jar test is, is where you mix
the chemicals ahead of time in a clear jar
[SPEAKER_00]: and visually inspect them to see if
there's a separation or other forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you mix everything together and let it
settle for a little bit, and it comes up
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and consistent, this would be a very
positive result.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you mix everything and you get
the separation, these are an evidence of
[SPEAKER_00]: visual sign that these fertilizers may
have a negative interaction and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to apply these to your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you mix them together,
you want to let them settle and see if any
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitate forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a solid as a result of mixing two
liquids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be another negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're performing the jar test,
you don't want to simply splash everything
[SPEAKER_00]: in the jar, take a quick look and move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to give it some time to have an
interaction to see if a precipitate will
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's going to take several
minutes, or I usually let them sit for
[SPEAKER_00]: about half an hour, go back and inspect
them, and if it all looks nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent, then you have very good odds
of having low odds of negative
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions, even as you're going through
and applying the various products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that gives you some idea of what
to look for and what to consider when
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing fertilizers to have positive
interactions and benefits of saving time.
Thank you.
Good luck.
