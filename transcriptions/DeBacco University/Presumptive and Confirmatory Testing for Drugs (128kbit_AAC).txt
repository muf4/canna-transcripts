[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another Debaco University
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be looking at
presumptive and confirmatory testing for
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Presumptive tests are the ones are going
to be used initially on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Confirmatory is going to identify the
specific substance and typically performed
[SPEAKER_00]: in a lab setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially those presumptive testing,
as I said, typically initiated by law
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement or those first on the scene,
and they indicate if the suspected
[SPEAKER_00]: substance is present or not present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test kit will typically produce a positive
indicating color if the substance is
[SPEAKER_00]: present.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see right next to me here a testing
reagent for ecstasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then laboratory testing that confirms with
certainty the presence of the suspected
[SPEAKER_00]: substance would be performed later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as a side note, that presumptive
testing can also be performed at a
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory setting as part of the analysis
process to at least determine or justify
[SPEAKER_00]: what further tests should be carried out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're looking at the presumptive
test for the Duconoy reagent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the Duconoy reagent is a positive test
or would be testing samples of suspected
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana or THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Duconoy test is conducted by placing a
small sample of the suspected material
[SPEAKER_00]: about the size of the tip of a typical
pocket knife to give you an idea inside a
[SPEAKER_00]: test vials we see here in the image above
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The deep blue purple tint of the liquid
indicates inside the vial indicates the
[SPEAKER_00]: test was positive for the cannabinoids
present in the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other THC containing drugs such as
marijuana hash oil and others will produce
[SPEAKER_00]: a light blue to dark purple reaction using
the Duconoy reagent test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is just one example of a
presumptive test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this confirmatory test that I was
mentioning earlier, confirmatory tests use
[SPEAKER_00]: instrumental analysis to positively
identify the contents of submitted
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically it's a multi-step process to
separate out individual components and
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process determines the chemical
characteristics of the compounds to be
[SPEAKER_00]: compared.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to make a positive
identification in this qualitative
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis and helps determine what
substances are present and if one or more
[SPEAKER_00]: of those substances is illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why this is typically done at a
laboratory setting is because it has a
[SPEAKER_00]: high degree of specificity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to be sure we're being very
clean, very sterile and isolating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting to identify the actual
chemical profiles versus a presumptive
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of like an up-down positive
negative, a general idea and then we would
[SPEAKER_00]: identify the specific substances with this
confirmatory test performed in a
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory setting.
Thank you.
