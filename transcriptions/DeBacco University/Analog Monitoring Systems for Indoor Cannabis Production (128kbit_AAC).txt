[SPEAKER_00]: So even though analog monitoring systems
may be considered kind of an old way of
[SPEAKER_00]: doing things, in this Tobacco University
video, I'm going to cover why they may
[SPEAKER_00]: still be utilized and why growers may
choose to use them over digital systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into analog
monitoring systems for indoor cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the advantages of an
analog monitoring system, first one being
[SPEAKER_00]: it's this simplified mechanics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're reliable and less prone to
failure, and they also tend to be less
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive compared to digital monitoring
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these are great attraction points to
many growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The analog systems are simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are just kind of a little bit of that
kind of fail safe end of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely allowing that kind of
repeatability.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can translate to a simple purchase
setup and go operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to calibrate standardized
in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just kind of are right there and kind
of in your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: With many other complications in a grow
facility, having this simplicity is a
[SPEAKER_00]: critical piece of environmental monitoring
can be welcome to many growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you're looking at just quick
reading at what's the temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having an analog system can be
advantageous in that regards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the analog is simple, the
reliability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Analog monitoring systems, due to their
simplicity, are often less prone to
[SPEAKER_00]: failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Digital sensors can fail unexpectedly,
where analog sensors will work with basic
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the likelihood of unexpected failure is
less than a digital operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give the comparison of these two different
phone types, the digital phone and more
[SPEAKER_00]: analog phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many times in the last 10 years have
people gone through and had to change out
[SPEAKER_00]: their digital phones when these old style
rotary analog phones can last for 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20, 30, potentially up to 50 years and
still be operational.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also in addition, we have to consider
price points.
[SPEAKER_00]: With many expenses of a growing operation,
saving some money and a monitoring system
[SPEAKER_00]: can be important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And analog systems, if set up properly,
will not perform any less than a competing
[SPEAKER_00]: digital system.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there may be some features missing
compared to a digital system, analog
[SPEAKER_00]: monitors can still provide growers
important information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why they can still be utilized
in some grow facilities very effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, where analog monitors are and are
not recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going with an analog system,
typically I really wouldn't recommend it
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're looking at pH or carbon dioxide
enrichment or looking at light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more advantageous for just the
temperature humidity, just to give you an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of where those typical environmental
factors are around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, I want you to remember with
digital and as well as analog,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that the sensor is only as good as the
placement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watch the other video here to make sure
you're placing your sensor in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So regardless of what system you're using,
you're getting an accurate and reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
