[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to get skin cancer
related to sunlight exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can tell from the title slide
here, I'm going to try to use some real
[SPEAKER_00]: images.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them may be a little graphic,
but this is sadly what skin cancer does
[SPEAKER_00]: look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And relating it to sunlight exposure and
how that can increase your odds of sadly
[SPEAKER_00]: getting one of these particular skin
cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So melanin related to cancer risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, your cancer risk is actually
inversely proportional to your epidermal
[SPEAKER_00]: melanin content.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you notice here, here's our
melanin content increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our epidermal melanin content is
increasing as we get darker skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our cancer risk down here is actually
becoming less and less inversely
[SPEAKER_00]: proportional.
[SPEAKER_00]: As melanin increases, cancer risk will
decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have the darker skin types,
you'll have more melanin and that can
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce your skin cancer risk at least
related to sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we call this inversely proportional
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, sunlight and skin cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's different types of skin cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's the broad category.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see there's many different types of
actual skin cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What skin cancer is in all these cases,
it's uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It occurs when unrepaired DNA is damaged
in the skin cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here often from UV radiation which
can be from sunshine, sunlight,
[SPEAKER_00]: or also tanning beds can also produce high
amounts of this UV radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can trigger mutations and genetic
defects that can then lead to skin cells
[SPEAKER_00]: to multiply rapidly and form malignant
tumors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, many different types here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some more rare than others and some very
deadly compared to others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important to just keep an eye
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still look at your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you notice any of these or
something that looks like these starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to form, to contact someone immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here it says comparisons,
effects of UV radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warts are benign and not cancerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're skin growths that appear when a
virus infects the top layer of skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may ask, well, why don't I include
images of warts here on the, if it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually looks like a finger here or
literally can occur on the eyelid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these are often confused with skin
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're benign.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not cancerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just skin growths that appear
when a virus infects the top layer of
[SPEAKER_00]: skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, can be very similar in
appearance, but very different in the root
[SPEAKER_00]: cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a basal cell carcinoma,
which is abnormal uncontrolled growths
[SPEAKER_00]: that arise from basal cells which are in
the deepest layer of the epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They almost never spread beyond the
original site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's not a good thing that it's
cancerous, but they don't really spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of got to look at the,
you know, try to find the positive here.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a melanoma here, a malignant
melanoma in particular, are aggressive and
[SPEAKER_00]: life-threatening skin cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a very high tendency to spread
and early detection is very important for
[SPEAKER_00]: these so that effective controls can be
put in place to limit the chance of it
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading or becoming life-threatening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you look for, for skin cancer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's the ABCD here, asymmetry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's asymmetrical, does half,
doesn't look like the other, that's one
[SPEAKER_00]: red flag.
[SPEAKER_00]: B is for border, irregular edges or blurry
or sketchy kind of is that irregular
[SPEAKER_00]: border region.
[SPEAKER_00]: The color is either varied or
inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be brown, black regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diameter is bigger than the size of a
pencil, just approximately six
[SPEAKER_00]: millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then evolution any mole that changes
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I kind of put up here,
what I found, just great, there's links in
[SPEAKER_00]: the description to some of these,
is this would be kind of normal and this
[SPEAKER_00]: would be cancerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of comparing to that what one
would normally kind of look like when we
[SPEAKER_00]: look at color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very consistent in the normal,
but in the cancerous one, you could see
[SPEAKER_00]: two different regions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the border, very even border here and
a very kind of choppy, a lot of kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers peninsulas located here for the
cancerous one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's important to kind of have
that comparison, but you can see just even
[SPEAKER_00]: from these images, the high degree of
variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when in doubt, make an appointment with
a doctor or dermatologist and be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: get it checked out so that you can
determine whether you're in that normal
[SPEAKER_00]: category or if you should be concerned if
you're in that cancerous category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Key part with this in many things is
prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply reducing your UV light exposure to
use a sunscreen or just a physical barrier
[SPEAKER_00]: such as clothing can help you down the
road to stop accumulating potential
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations in your DNA and reduce your
total skin cancer risk.
Thank you.
