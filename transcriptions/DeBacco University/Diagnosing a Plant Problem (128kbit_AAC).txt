[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here we're going to look at
diagnosing a plant problem and how to go
[SPEAKER_00]: about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not jumping to conclusions and just
looking at a leaf or a plant and saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, that's clearly this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Properly diagnosing, going through some
step-wise process to classify the problem
[SPEAKER_00]: and diagnose it properly so that control
measures can be implemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, you have to know they plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to know what the plant looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in order to diagnose a potential
issue, you need to know what the normal
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should the plant look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could vary depending on the
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking notes is good, continuing to
document pictures, because you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: know what the normal of the plant should
look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Condition documentation is important,
and this can help you track trends and
[SPEAKER_00]: changes over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did the plant look last week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your memory may not be as good as you
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking those pictures will allow you to
refer to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those pictures are great, but also
including captions is also important,
[SPEAKER_00]: because those can include the conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all important information to
include not only the conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperature, what you might be
noticing at the time, how old the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is, all the things to document.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to classify the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this involves three main groups,
each having subcategories.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key is, again, not to jump to
conclusions and try to be impartial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proper classification will help you
develop a plan in action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those classifications are,
is it a nutrient issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be a toxicity or a deficiency,
a disease, or grower-implemented kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, for nutrients, they tend to
be across a field or in the same kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: run that we may see in a grow operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Important to notice the placement of the
issue in relation to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it new growth, or is it older growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example here of a nutrient
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is nitrogen in a cucurbit field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we could see low nitrogen,
and as we progress this way, we get into
[SPEAKER_00]: more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a field application.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was happening is that through heavy
rains, the nitrogen was leaching out of
[SPEAKER_00]: here and running down the hill a little
bit and kind of allowing these to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: proper amount of nitrogen and these to
become deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see that trend occurring
in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trends are common with nutrient
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a disease can have a quick onset.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be sure you're checking both
the tops of the leaves and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: underside of the leaves, or many diseases
will start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, we have a grower issue,
and this usually occurs in isolated cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be poor hand-watering or consistency
with watering, breaking the plant through
[SPEAKER_00]: mishandling, not spraying, improperly
causing spray damage here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our applicator blight would be one
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see an herbicide spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are ways that we want to go about
in approaching when we're diagnosing an
[SPEAKER_00]: issue with our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and we'll see you
next time.
