[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to be looking at
blood vessels of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a picture here of some blood,
and we also have something that may
[SPEAKER_00]: initially seem unrelated, which is the
Connecticut River watershed, on any
[SPEAKER_00]: watershed, really, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is, is we can make
connections between this and the blood
[SPEAKER_00]: vessels in our own body, and see how
there's some similarities and some
[SPEAKER_00]: differences that do occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting into the classes of blood
vessels, there's three main classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: First are arteries and arterioles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They carry blood away from the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veins, or venules, carry blood to the
heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in between our arteries and our veins
are this structure here called the
[SPEAKER_00]: capillary, and this allows for exchange of
nutrients, wastes, and gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now typically, as we see here,
the arteries typically may be drawn in red
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're carrying oxygenated blood,
and veins are typically in blue because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're carrying blood away from the
heart, deoxygenated blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, even though we may draw it like this
and have nice red and blue images,
[SPEAKER_00]: our blood, no matter where it is in the
body, will be a shade of red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't think that your blood is,
obviously, turns blue when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: deoxygenated.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's always a shade of red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, focusing first on our
arteries.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are thick-walled and lined with
smooth muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, this is carrying blood away from
the heart, so away from the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arteries think away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The arterioles branch off from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They expand with each heartbeat and
contract afterwards, which is what's
[SPEAKER_00]: helping the blood move.
[SPEAKER_00]: As blood comes from the heart in large
pulses, the artery must be able to expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, arteries are made up of three
walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see one of them here, also where that
smooth muscle is located.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arterioles are smaller in diameter than
arteries, and their surrounding muscle
[SPEAKER_00]: layer can be relaxed to enlarge their
diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these specific kind of details
about the artery help move blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arterioles, as I mentioned, can constrict
to direct and control blood flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may, for example, increase blood
supply to the skin to allow more heat to
[SPEAKER_00]: be dispersed in the environment,
or constrict during stress to redirect
[SPEAKER_00]: blood to the heart and muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our arterial example.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's leading and getting closer to our
capillaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, our veins, or venules, which are a
small structure, again, on the other side
[SPEAKER_00]: of the capillary, they're thin-walled,
and they collect blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low pressure in these venules allows the
capillary beds to drain into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we have our blood coming this
way, going through our capillary,
[SPEAKER_00]: first entering our thin-walled venule.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, we're going into our veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So veins of thinner layers of muscle and
elastic fiber, or walls, than their
[SPEAKER_00]: arteries.
[SPEAKER_00]: When emptying, they will collapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So important to remember are some
differences between our arteries and our
[SPEAKER_00]: veins here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contraction of skeletal muscle helps move
blood up the limbs and back to the heart,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also veins contain valves which
prevent backflow of blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here, our blood going this way,
and to prevent the backflow of that blood,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see here that valve in our veins
closing up here, so blood cannot go
[SPEAKER_00]: backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps move blood to get it back to
the heart so it can be recirculated
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arteries compared to a vein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a nice little direct comparison
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our example of our artery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our example of our vein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they share the same internal
features, but the walls of the arteries
[SPEAKER_00]: are much thicker because of the higher
pressure they have to endure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a micrograph comparison that shows
the relative differences in thickness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little harder to tell in this image
here, but in the pictorial here,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the labeling, it's very easy to tell
that much thinner appearance of the vein
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the artery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does also exist here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have much thicker artery than our vein
because arteries have to deal with higher
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, veins can be turning blood to the
heart, preventing black flow, these
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of valves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's low pressure in veins,
so that's important to make note of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have skeletal muscles and
unidirectional valves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we see here, pushing, moving the
blood this way, the valve opens,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we see the valve closing,
here, preventing that back flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see that here, blood flowing this
way, and then that valve closing,
[SPEAKER_00]: preventing the back flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here, muscles relax and the
valve closes, and then the muscle
[SPEAKER_00]: contracts here, and now we're able to
force and move that blood through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a little hard to tell in this
graph, in this picture here, but we can
[SPEAKER_00]: see the veins are located in this
distinctive region here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capillaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is in between the venules and the
arterials.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are body tissues that can contain a
vast network of thin capillaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capillaries themselves have very thin
walls and allow blood to pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only one cell thick and allowing
these blood vessels to travel through here
[SPEAKER_00]: one cell at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows the exchange of gases,
such as carbon dioxide and oxygen,
[SPEAKER_00]: also nutrients and waste through the
process of diffusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important this is not active
transport, but this is diffusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capillaries are so fine that red blood
cells must line up single file to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what's allowing that maximum
amount of surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get that kind of net appearance to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's our filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the movement of carbon dioxide
and oxygen and nutrients and waste is
[SPEAKER_00]: simply by the non-energy requiring
diffusion process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, the capillary network
connects the arteries in the veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Individual capillaries have high
resistance to flow, but the total
[SPEAKER_00]: cross-sectional areas of capillaries is
greater than those of the arteries leading
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So blood loss, most of its pressure and
velocity is it passes through this vast
[SPEAKER_00]: capillary network.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have that high pressure here coming
from the heart, through our aorta,
[SPEAKER_00]: through our arteries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot that's being lost, we have to
squeeze those blood cells one at a time
[SPEAKER_00]: through the capillaries before returning
to veins, before going back to the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blood vessels, here's a nice comparison
between our arteries and our veins,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of putting everything together,
showing that you that comparison of how
[SPEAKER_00]: thick the arteries are versus how thin the
veins are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean they're necessarily different
diameters as we see here, but we notice
[SPEAKER_00]: also the presence of a valve here in the
veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So veins think valve, arteries think a way
from the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, here's a couple of major arteries
and veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get into these a little bit more
detail when we focus in on the heart
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our femoral artery is near our femur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see some of the names here
match that of the bones of the skeleton
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're near.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, our arteries are
typically in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veins are typically represented in blue,
even though our blood, no matter where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's located in our body, is always a
shade of red.
So we'll get into that a little bit more
detail.
