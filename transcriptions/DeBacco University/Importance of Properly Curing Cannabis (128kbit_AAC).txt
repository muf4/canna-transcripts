[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBacco University video,
I'm going to go over the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: properly curing your cannabis buds because
if you've gotten them through to the very
[SPEAKER_00]: end, you don't want to reduce your
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to maximize your return on
investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully this video lecture will help
you do just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over the importance of
properly curing cannabis buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, curing in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, often considered to be a blending of
an art and a science.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some scientific bases you should
follow, but it's kind of that properly
[SPEAKER_00]: curing process has a little bit of an art
on this to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grower or curer needs to control the
curing environment during this
[SPEAKER_00]: post-harvest process, regardless of if the
original plants were grown indoors or
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this applies to both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, indoor growers, you might have a
little bit more of a visualness that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor growers, you might have a little
bit more volume to contend with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, you should go through a curing
process and be mindful of the importance
[SPEAKER_00]: of the steps presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the curing room environmental controls
that should be in place, similar to a
[SPEAKER_00]: drying room, humidity goals around 62% and
then you want to have a temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: control as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically maintaining that around 60
degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I said, indoor or outdoors,
typically the curing process will occur
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors, regardless of where the original
plant material was grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you want to avoid loss of
degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the point of that is to have it grown
indoors because you have more control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have this outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some operations will utilize a greenhouse
or cold frame that will have at least some
[SPEAKER_00]: protection from the extremes of the
outdoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to avoid the loss is the cannabinoids
and terpenes found in the cannabis can
[SPEAKER_00]: start to degrade soon after harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the curing process helps preserve the
levels originally found in the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: because you don't want to go through and
have all those kind of high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and terpenes and then just
lose them to a poor curing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to maintain those levels and not
lose them to simple plant breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now after proper curing, the risk of mold
developing is greatly reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I say greatly reduced because it's not
eliminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go through a proper curing
process by reducing the humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: by getting everything set up, by drying
everything down evenly, the odds of the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds producing mold after an efficient
curing process is greatly reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the very last step here within the
curing is you should involve sending out a
[SPEAKER_00]: subsample out for testing in a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on how big your harvest is
will depend on the kind of how many buds
[SPEAKER_00]: you take versus how many buds you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to hold on to the harvest lot
that's represented by the sample that is
[SPEAKER_00]: sent to a third party lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only move the end product to packaging and
shipping once the test results come back
[SPEAKER_00]: and passing levels are achieved for all
parameters to ensure a safe product is
[SPEAKER_00]: being sent to consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also a legal requirement for
labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why you want to hold those
products before you send them to the
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging and shipping process is that if
they fail, you want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not packaging up a product that may
have failed one of the tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you want to make sure when you're
labeling, you're able to label the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid content, label the terpene
content, ensure it passed all the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology, all the heavy metals,
all the pesticides, all the testing that
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very important last step that
a lot of growers forget about is that they
[SPEAKER_00]: still focus on the drying and the curing,
which is all very important, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: getting their product tested so that the
consumers looking to purchase their
[SPEAKER_00]: product can have the information presented
to them so they can make an educated
[SPEAKER_00]: decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
