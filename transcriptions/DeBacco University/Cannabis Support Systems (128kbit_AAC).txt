[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at some
different ways to physically help support
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these could be used as first very
small plants, but are more commonly used
[SPEAKER_00]: on large plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see an outdoor grow with a lot
of wind and other environmental factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it becomes even more advantageous
that not only are these support systems in
[SPEAKER_00]: place, but they're fairly strong and
robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trellis netting is the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that kind of going back on that
title slide, we see some horizontal and
[SPEAKER_00]: some vertical trellis netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trellis netting needs to be layered out
ahead of time to allow plants to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is referring to kind of the more
horizontal approach, allowing these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow up and through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be supported well so plants
don't fall over and break later in the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing cycle when the upper plant yields
increase in weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that initially,
because it's very spaced and a lot of air
[SPEAKER_00]: can come through it, it's just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as these plants grow through it and
become heavy laden with yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to make sure that it is well
established.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not jeopardizing your entire
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's stakes, easy to apply when
and where they're needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always good to have a couple extra on
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you reuse them, they should be cleaned
in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can kind of see at the end of the
season here where we're getting our
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest, seeing how the architecture of
those stakes looked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's an earlier part of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see them being tied up here and
kind of help support those plants keep
[SPEAKER_00]: into vertical growing arrangement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, there's cages and they're best
applied early in the growing cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, having to put the plants in the
ground soon after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can transmit disease, if not clean
between uses, if constructed of reusable
[SPEAKER_00]: material, such as these wire cages here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These trellis ones, both the horizontal
and the vertical, typically are wrapped up
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end season and discarded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metal cages are a great option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure you're in some way cleaning
them between your growing seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
