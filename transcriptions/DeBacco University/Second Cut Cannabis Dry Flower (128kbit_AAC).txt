[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've seen Second Cut Cannabis Dry
Flower for sale and wondered what that
[SPEAKER_00]: was?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this Tobacco University video will
cover just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into Second Cut
Cannabis Dry Flower and get some
[SPEAKER_00]: information about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, I want to thank C.T.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharma here because they provide publicly
available analytical reports and labels on
[SPEAKER_00]: products they produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: The descriptions are intended to provide
an understanding of some of the end
[SPEAKER_00]: products of the cannabis plant and we're
going to look at here at Second Cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the analytical reports are great to
look at to make sure if you're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing or considering Second Flower,
what you should be looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting into the description of exactly
what Second Flower is, well, it's smaller,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of nickel sized buds, usually leafier
and less dense than the premium flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It delivers all the same effects as a
premium flower in the sense that it has
[SPEAKER_00]: the same terpenes and the same
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, Second Cut is separated from
premium flower, although the use of a
[SPEAKER_00]: screen system that filters out the smaller
buds from the premium, basically those
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller, less dense buds, but because
they're coming from the same plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: they should have the same basic profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what are the options when we're
looking at Second Cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some cultivars as premium flower,
that's often looked at as an affordable
[SPEAKER_00]: way to experience different cultivars as
much more inexpensive than those of the
[SPEAKER_00]: premium version.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great if you wanted to consider
trying a new variety, a new cultivar,
[SPEAKER_00]: Second Cut might be the option simply
because it's less expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the dispensary, the
cultivar, and the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it'll determine the price,
but compared to premium flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will likely be less expensive of the
same cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the uses for Second Flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Second Flower is favored by
consumers for its easy accessibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller buds can easily be broken up
at home for rolling and vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be used in all the same
devices as premium flowers used in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just remember, it will be kind of that
less dense and smaller size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example of a certificate of
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, while most consumers focus on
the terpenes and cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep in mind that that first page is
almost more important in the sense it
[SPEAKER_00]: gives a microbial, heavy metal,
micro toxin, and pesticide analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to see a pass for all of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your right as a consumer to be asking
for this type of paperwork associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that you're purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while it is good to kind of,
the label will kind of summarize things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says pass for all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this does present a lot of the
information very cleanly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the little QR code here for checking,
but it's also good to inquire about the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual paperwork where that information
was derived from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're checking the names, you're checking
the dates, just a way for you to be an
[SPEAKER_00]: informed consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
