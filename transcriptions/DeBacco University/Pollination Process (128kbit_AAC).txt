[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm going to talk about the
pollination process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually very important to our
basic survival in production of food in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see an example of a bee going
through and doing this exact process I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be describing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start with, why are there different
kinds of flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, again, pertaining to
angiosperms and the pollination process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So insects and plants have co-evolved so
that certain insects specialize in
[SPEAKER_00]: visiting particular kinds of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A particular insect carries pollen from
one individual flower to another of the
[SPEAKER_00]: same species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bees are the most numerous insect
pollinator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Birds can also pollinate some flowers,
especially red ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have hummingbird feeder,
typically you put red dye in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grasses and some other angiosperms have
reverted to wind pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because there are insect
pollinators, they don't pollinate
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bees and UV light, which is
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bees see UV light, so flowers look
different to them compared to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, our visible light spectrum
here, UV is ultraviolet waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ultraviolet, we're talking more over
here in our light spectrum here,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting closer to our x-rays and gamma
rays than we are from our infrared or our
[SPEAKER_00]: radar waves there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's called ultraviolet because it's
beyond the violet spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we see versus what bees are able
to see, differences in color sensitivity
[SPEAKER_00]: between humans, honeybees, and
hummingbirds is what provides flowers to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually look different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think these are some notable examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under normal light, we see this as a
consistently yellow flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, under UV light, this is almost
like a target region that develops in the
[SPEAKER_00]: center.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the bees are going to see and
that's what they're going to target to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to find the pollen or the nectar in their
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal, we see our nice kind of yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, under UV light, we see that
distinctive darkening center region and
[SPEAKER_00]: the same goes for this flower and also
this flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides kind of that extra highlight
to tell the bees, hey, come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the nectar is.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, those flowers match the
pollinator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hummingbirds tend to pollinate red
flowers and you'll notice they have a very
[SPEAKER_00]: long beak, thin beak at that and the
flowers replicate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bats pollinate white flowers that have
sweet smells and open at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those sweet smells are so the bats can
help detect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moths are also nighttime pollinators and
some gourds will pollinate very white
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers that open at night again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ants can also pollinate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we see here, an ant eating all this
pollen grains over him go through and go
[SPEAKER_00]: through to the next flower to help
transfer some of that or even help that
[SPEAKER_00]: same flower get pollinated with itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollination process.
[SPEAKER_00]: In seed plants, free water is not required
in the fertilization process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollination by insects, wind, or other
agents transfers pollen to an ovule.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen grain then cracks open and
sprouts as a pollen tube in bringing the
[SPEAKER_00]: sperm cells directly to the egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not familiar with the parts,
you can refer back to some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: videos that I have, particularly
eugenosperms and angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, the pollen lands here on the sticky
stigma and it travels down here and has to
[SPEAKER_00]: go all the way to reach the ovule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a distance that it needs to
travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because the pollen is transferred
to the stigma, doesn't mean it
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically gets pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That needs to be able to survive and live
and be able to travel all this distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in particular, we have something
called double fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two sperm or pollen grains are required
to produce a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: One sperm fertilizes the egg to produce
the zygote, 2N.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other fertilizes polar nuclei to form
the 3N endosperm, which is the food source
[SPEAKER_00]: for the emerald.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this means one pollen grain is
fertilizing the egg to produce the zygote.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one is fertilizing this area
here to produce the food for that seed
[SPEAKER_00]: once germinated to initially feed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here's our pollen grain,
our pollen tube, two sperm cells coming
[SPEAKER_00]: down, both fertilizing this particular
egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: One technically is fertilizing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one is making the endosperm,
which is the food region here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pollen grain adheres to the sticky
stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains two cells, generates the cell
in tube cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen tube grows into the style.
[SPEAKER_00]: The generative cell transfers inside the
pollen tube, dividing to form two sperm
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen tube penetrates the open in the
ovule to call the macrophile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here one of the sperm fertilizes the egg
to form the diploid zygote.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other sperm fertilizes two polar
nuclei to form the triploid endosperm,
[SPEAKER_00]: which becomes the food source for the
growing embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an important process that does
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the same image down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This double fertilization, endosperms
produce special, highly nutritious tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: called the endosperm for their seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a flower is pollinated, the pollen
tube grows down to form pollen grain on
[SPEAKER_00]: the stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen grain contains two haploid
sperm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first sperm fuses with the egg at the
base of the ovary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second sperm fuses with the polar
nuclei to form the triploid endosperm
[SPEAKER_00]: cell, which divides faster than the zygote
and gives rise to the endosperm tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember this endosperm tissue is the food
region for the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process of fertilization to produce
both zygote and endosperm is called double
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that pollination process is actually
accidental, so it's kind of amazing that
[SPEAKER_00]: something we're so dependent on as far as
sustaining our species and providing
[SPEAKER_00]: enough food for the world is actually an
accidental process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollinator gets nectar and
accidentally transfers pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male flower, so here's a bee going
down getting nectar, bumping into this
[SPEAKER_00]: portion, transferring pollen over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the bee's more concerned about the
nectar than the actual pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bee flies out of this flower,
and this is a female flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a squash plant that produces both,
and that's why I chose this to show it
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the bee going back down here to get
the nectar, and now it's kind of taking
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen that it acquired here and
transferring it to the stigma here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you typically see bees in these
types of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: With their heads down, trying to absorb
the nectar down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not really concerned with the
transfer of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more concerned with the
acquisition of the nectar, and the pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: that's getting transferred is simply an
accidental process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two parts of pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have something called
cross-pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pollen is transferred between two
different individuals from the same
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one flower, here's another flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is cross-pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It increases our genetic variability in
this species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it can produce unfit individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus self-pollination, where we see
pollen from the same flower getting
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated with the same flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pollen from the same individual is
used to pollinate the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage is this produces seeds when
individuals are isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of reduces the genetic
variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't open the species up to really
adapting much to the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, pros and cons to each,
but both can occur and produce viable
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the life cycle of an angiosperm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tying a lot of the other videos together,
tying in some of the flower anatomy,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the terms we discussed previously,
such as meiosis and mitosis, the sperm
[SPEAKER_00]: cells, the egg cells, pollination process,
something you may want to review and be
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with for the quiz coming up on
this section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
