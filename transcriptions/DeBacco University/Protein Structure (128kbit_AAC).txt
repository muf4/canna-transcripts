[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to be looking at
protein structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen this initial image,
different ways of representing structure
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to show the three-dimensional
shape, because for proteins, as we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to see here, shape is very important
to their proper function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just give you a basic idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's four main stages of organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the amino acid sequence,
and this is going to take on an initial
[SPEAKER_00]: shape, and it's going to start to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately here, the fourth stage of
protein structure is ultimately going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a functional protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the general overview of protein
structure levels, we have the assembly of
[SPEAKER_00]: the amino acid sequence, the initial
folding, or forming alpha and beta sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the packaging here, where we're
starting to get a three-dimensional
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, and then interaction,
where we have a complex of a protein
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule making this functional protein in
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the basics, protein
assembly, the primary structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The specific sequence of amino acids is
what's going to form a protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking here at a ribosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This occurs in the cell, in the cytosol,
and this involves polymerization of amino
[SPEAKER_00]: acids attached to the tRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our messenger RNA here,
encoding for the sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our ribosome, and we are building
our primary structure, which is our tRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bringing in the amino acid sequence,
binding here, allowing us to follow the
[SPEAKER_00]: messenger RNA sequence for amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is using the primary structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the amino acids being linked
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those amino acids that form a linear
kind of chain here, this is only
[SPEAKER_00]: one-dimensional.
[SPEAKER_00]: A perfect linear amino acid polymer is
neither functional nor energetically
[SPEAKER_00]: favorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folding needs to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just the link of amino acids,
but now we need folding to take on the
[SPEAKER_00]: proper shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see here is that initial
folding is creating now our secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is folding, and this shape is taking
on because of hydrogen bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this occurs in the cytosol of the
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It involves localized interactions,
which is the primary structure here
[SPEAKER_00]: developing an alpha helix.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a beta sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are both part of the secondary
structure that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that secondary structure is the
chemical nature of the carboxyl and amino
[SPEAKER_00]: groups, all the amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This permits the hydrogen bond to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is causing these molecules to become
more stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hence, this defines the secondary
structure within a protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we see here, alpha helix and beta
sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: The R groups, or the variant group,
is what impacts the likelihood of
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary structure formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So primary structure, we see our amino
acids listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we look at the secondary structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That secondary structure is nonlinear,
starting at that three-dimensional shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is because of those variant
groups that are now able to interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interaction, as we see here,
here is that hydrogen bonding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also van der Waals
interactions, causing this structure to
[SPEAKER_00]: take on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specific shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, there's alpha helix and beta
sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have regular hydrogen bonding
patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can classify them as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beta sheets, as you may assume here,
forms a very flat structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The alpha helix kind of looks like that
DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of getting that wrapping that
does occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cytosol, we're looking at now our
tertiary structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It involves interactions between secondary
structure elements, yielding the next
[SPEAKER_00]: level, our tertiary structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could see right here, we have an
alpha helix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a beta sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're getting a further interaction
that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tertiary structures, this final
three-dimensional shape of the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nonlinear, and they're
three-dimensional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's important to show this
rotating, so you can get appreciation for
[SPEAKER_00]: the unique three-dimensional structure
that it does have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, protein interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here, tertiary, our quaternary
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're getting different
interactions that occur with these
[SPEAKER_00]: polypeptides.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's multi-components now interacting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does still occur in the cytosol,
and it's proximate to other folded and
[SPEAKER_00]: packaged proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: This involves interaction among tertiary
structure elements separate into polymer
[SPEAKER_00]: chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are nonlinear, three-dimensional
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the example here, kind of a
cartoon image, but this is hemoglobin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see distinctive one, two,
three, four different structures here,
[SPEAKER_00]: all coming and interacting with one
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: To form a functional final protein
structure here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that three-dimensional shape,
as we see here, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I show it in a rotating basis,
so you can get an idea of the uniqueness
[SPEAKER_00]: from all different angles here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, each protein has a unique structure,
and that's important to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that amino acid sequence,
that free energy normalization,
[SPEAKER_00]: leads to that structure, and the dynamics
will then lead to the proper function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this amino acid sequence, what looks
like kind of a garbled, kind of misprint
[SPEAKER_00]: here, each one of these letters represents
an amino acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those amino acids form a chain,
and through the structure and ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: the dynamics to form the proper function,
that folding process will make this amino
[SPEAKER_00]: acid sequence a functional protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, folds can be used for classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a simple fold, there's this
architecture, which is the overall shape
[SPEAKER_00]: and orientation of the secondary
structure, as I mentioned here,
[SPEAKER_00]: as alpha and beta barrels, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can classify these at what we call fold
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a categorization that takes into
account the empirical or biological
[SPEAKER_00]: properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important because shape determines
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're kind of classifying different
shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could also classify them as super
families, which in addition to the fold
[SPEAKER_00]: families, includes evolutionary or
ancestral properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gets into trying to track different
proteins or shapes over the course of
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionary time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is an interesting video here that
helps you understand the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: protein folding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, because protein folding does occur,
we need to have a way to allow proteins or
[SPEAKER_00]: amino acids to fold properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, to help newly produced proteins fold
properly, we have something called
[SPEAKER_00]: chaperone proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's literally, it looks like a donut
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's literally this kind of protective
interior structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: These chaperone proteins allow a
protective area to allow these amino acid
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence to fold into proper functional
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: If these chaperone proteins have
deficiencies, they play a role in certain
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cystic fibrosis and Alzheimer's disease is
an example of two of them, where proteins
[SPEAKER_00]: don't fold properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: To kind of go over that same thing,
we have a primary structure, which is just
[SPEAKER_00]: the amino acid sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: That then will lead to secondary
structures, which are alpha helixes and
[SPEAKER_00]: beta sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tertiary structure is the initial
three-dimensional structure formed by the
[SPEAKER_00]: assembly of those structures, and that's
the quaternary structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where they're interaction forming
with multiple peptide chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just another way to kind of look at it,
with the amino acid sequence, we're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into initial structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of forming a
three-dimensional shape, and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction that's occurring here at the
final stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
Thanks for watching.
