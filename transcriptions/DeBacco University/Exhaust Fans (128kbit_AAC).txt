[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look
specifically at exhaust fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while this is a picture here of a
greenhouse with exhaust fans, it can also
[SPEAKER_00]: be applied to smaller grow areas or even
grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of the extreme case here with
greenhouses, and this is what exhaust fans
[SPEAKER_00]: on the large scale will look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the key part is with an exhaust fan,
this is step one, it's a very important
[SPEAKER_00]: step, is to calculate the cubic air volume
of the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to then size the fans so that
the entire volume of air can be removed in
[SPEAKER_00]: under five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers even prefer to vent the room
about every one minute, especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not using carbon dioxide
enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that key first step is to measure the
grow space because you want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're matching the size of your
ventilation fan, your exhaust fan in this
[SPEAKER_00]: case, to that volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it too big, you don't want
it too small, you want it to match the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next comes the fan placement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So placement of the fan is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The location is generally favoring mid to
upper room height to help ensure the
[SPEAKER_00]: warmest air is removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the setup I have here,
very towards the top, there's a carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: filter also attached at the very top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's ensuring that the warmest air is
being removed and exhausted out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then running ducting to help ensure the
system is lightproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see here, the grow tents is all
sealed up, and there's a slight bend in
[SPEAKER_00]: this here to prevent any sort of light
infiltration from coming in or any light
[SPEAKER_00]: leaks here from the actual fan connection
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also very important to keep in
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, if you are using CO2, you don't
want to waste your CO2 by exhausting it
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: A timer or other interrupt system may be
used if CO2 enrichment is being
[SPEAKER_00]: implemented, also being used to reduce CO2
waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to have your CO2 running
the same time you're exhausting your fan,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you've oversized your fan,
you could be taking in and exhausting out
[SPEAKER_00]: this carbon dioxide and essentially
wasting that, that you're putting the time
[SPEAKER_00]: and energy into enriching your grow space
with.
