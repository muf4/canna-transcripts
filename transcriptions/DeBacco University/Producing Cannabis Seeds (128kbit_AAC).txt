[SPEAKER_00]: So while not often done, producing
cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many times growers either purchase
seeds or clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than going through the hassle of
producing their own, I figured I just
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to touch on what it does take to
produce cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you make an informed decision whether
it's something you want to pursue or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So producing seeds is often not advised
due to variability that seeds do produce,
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to select out males when you do
plant seeds, the lack of cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: production within the square foot of your
growth space, and chance at pollinating
[SPEAKER_00]: females unintentionally through pollen
that may get caught up in ventilation
[SPEAKER_00]: systems or nearby plants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's very, very fine and it
does spread quite well even though you may
[SPEAKER_00]: try to control it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A seed, keep in mind the plant has to
invest energy to fully develop in the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: because seeds do contain an embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a peach here, but an embryo,
an endosperm which is the energy storage
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where a lot of the energy goes to
and a seed coat as a protective shell to
[SPEAKER_00]: help protect that seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again there's a little simplified
rendition of what a cutaway of a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: might look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when producing seeds it takes about
six to eight weeks to ripen those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and the way you can kind of tell when they
are ripened is when the seeds rattle in
[SPEAKER_00]: the pods they're fully mature and harvest
can occur just slightly before this time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's good to wait until then.
[SPEAKER_00]: May not be as pronounced as a rattle
snake, but you kind of get that rattling
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of sound when you kind of move the
flower here, that's a good time to know
[SPEAKER_00]: that those seeds are probably ripe enough
and ready to be harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you don't wait long enough,
so some growers try to shortcut the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: production phase, when you harvest them
too early, often the seed quality will be
[SPEAKER_00]: poor and have reduced germination rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for this is that the endosperm
may not be fully developed to provide the
[SPEAKER_00]: embryo with enough energy to start before
it's able to emerge from the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: start capturing sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just on the quick picture here we could
see some of these seeds, such as this one,
[SPEAKER_00]: this one, one over here are not very
mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those darker seed coats and heavier seeds
will typically indicate a fully mature
[SPEAKER_00]: seed because it's had time to fully
develop its seed coat which indicates that
[SPEAKER_00]: the endosperm is probably as well
developed as could be and that will
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the odds of germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these that are lighter colorations
or even a slight green color typically
[SPEAKER_00]: have very poor germination rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use this also to kind of
inspect your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do go through and harvest them to
make sure that you're selecting for the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones with the best odds of germination and
again it takes a little time to wait,
[SPEAKER_00]: just so you're advised on what it takes to
produce cannabis seeds and typically
[SPEAKER_00]: growers will commit to just seed
production and not try to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: un-pollinated flowers with seeds because
of the degree that the male pollen can
[SPEAKER_00]: spread and could potentially cross
contaminate other areas or grow rooms that
[SPEAKER_00]: people may have set up.
