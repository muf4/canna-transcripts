[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to describe the
basics of experimental design,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when you come across a problem,
you want to design an experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the general steps you should
follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first step is to generate a hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start by simply asking a question,
and then complete some background
[SPEAKER_00]: research, and then generate the
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about generating that
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't just start right with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to ask a question first,
and then complete some background
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that we're getting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to test the hypothesis,
generate new data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now,
[SPEAKER_00]: once we develop that, we want to look at
an independent and dependent variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're starting with the
independent variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a variable often denoted as X,
whose variation does not depend on that of
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the scientist changes or what changes
on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a way to think about this is the
independent variable is, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at growing a plant,
the independent variable could be the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of fertilizer added.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be an example of independent
variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, we look at dependent
variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a variable often denoted by Y,
whose value depends on that of another.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is being studied or measured?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if our independent variable is the
fertilizer, our dependent variable would
[SPEAKER_00]: be the height or how big the plant is
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, going back for a second,
independent variable, what the scientist
[SPEAKER_00]: is changing, for example, the amount of
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dependent variable would be the amount
that the plant is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a lot of students kind of
confuse those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be a pretty clear way to think
about them in at least one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that experiment, what is an
experiment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a scientific procedure to
undertaking to make a discovery,
[SPEAKER_00]: test hypothesis, or demonstrate unknown
fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a broad definition there,
but it's kind of performing those tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be in a sterile lab here,
or it could be looking at, can you
[SPEAKER_00]: generate power from a carrot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a control group in good
experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we think about control groups,
it's a set that does not receive a
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment by their researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, thinking with the plant
example, if we're looking at adding
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer, the control group would be the
set of plants that does not receive any
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of this is to provide a benchmark
to measure how other variables perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of getting into that separate group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may see in drug studies,
a placebo or sugar pill, one that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have the chemical substance in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, to act as that benchmark to then
act for comparison there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Constants are different than control
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Constants are portions of the study or
experiment that does not change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, pi is the same number
regardless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a constant in our plant growing example
could be the size of the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to have some plants growing
in small pots and some growing in large
[SPEAKER_00]: areas or outdoors and indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have constants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have the media that they're
growing in, one of the container they're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in, the environmental conditions
as constant as possible across all plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing the potential for fertilizer
variables to be shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have different trials that we may
go through and do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the number of times a protocol
is followed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times an experiment is not just
done once and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trials are, okay, we may grow plants in a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could grow them in the summer months
and then repeat that in the winter months,
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping conditions the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often times these experiments are
repeated, which we refer to as different
[SPEAKER_00]: trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may see the average of trials,
average of experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here some small tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, different trials repeating that
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collect and analyze the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, collecting data is an easy format.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, they may need to change when
it's published for others to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So analysis can take on many different
forms, which determine on the questions
[SPEAKER_00]: asked or the purpose of the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, these should be determined before
the research is concluded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to necessarily be
determining the questions asked and the
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose of the research at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of want to have that at the
beginning and kind of that's driving the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire process there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the conclusion is summarize how
your results support or contradict your
[SPEAKER_00]: original hypothesis, include key facts
from your background research to help
[SPEAKER_00]: explain the results as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that conclusion is kind of taking that
information, taking what you've seen,
[SPEAKER_00]: taking some things that you may have taken
notes on and kind of developing that
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusion, summarizing those results so
that someone, when reading your study,
[SPEAKER_00]: can kind of see what you're able to find
and then potentially build on that in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
Thank you.
