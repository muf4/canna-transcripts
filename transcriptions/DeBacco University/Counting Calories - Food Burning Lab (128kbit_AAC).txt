[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this Tabaco University video,
the procedures for the counting calories
[SPEAKER_00]: lab will be covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here we're going to go over the
basics of the calculating calories lab for
[SPEAKER_00]: food.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're looking at here is our setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a ring, a ring stand with a ring
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an aluminum can with some nails in
it to help support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, we have a thermometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a wooden skewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some way boats.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a food item to be testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some matches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a graduated cylinder so we can
precisely measure 50 milliliters of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may also want to add a timer to this
setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go through the basic
instructions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so now our next step is going to
involve putting the water here in our can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go through, add our water
right to the can that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to take the
temperature of that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking our 50 milliliters of water and
adding it to our can right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do we get the initial mass of our
food item?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we take a way boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put it on our balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make sure that it kind of settle out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tear the balance and we put our food
item in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's going to be a
marshmallow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're going to take our reading at
0.86 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.85 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take our food item,
take our wooden skewer, and very
[SPEAKER_00]: carefully, we want to be able to go
through and attach that right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're going to use for our
next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've just added the water to our can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take our thermometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure not to keep it at the bottom of
the can to make sure we're getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature of only the water there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll put it at the bottom and just
raise it up just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to take a reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, our reading is right around
22.4 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 22.4 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be our reading there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now comes the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to grab our matches here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're wearing your safety
goggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our food item.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be looking at placing that
approximately about that far under the
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure we're not contacting
the can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure we're not too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want it close, but we still want an
ability for oxygen to get in there to
[SPEAKER_00]: create an efficient burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to leave that down there for
a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should also be, if we had another
person, be easier to time how long this
[SPEAKER_00]: burns for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take our match.
[SPEAKER_00]: We light our match.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, the hottest part of the
flame is kind of towards the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to be using that to help kind
of get our marshmallow here to catch on
[SPEAKER_00]: fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I want to rotate it through,
blow that out, keeping our food item lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see right here that nice burn
that we're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does fall, you try to grab it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, try to rotate it as best as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different food items that had a little
issue there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can hear that the flame just went
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to take this marshmallow now
that it's burnt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab a wayboat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That metal part of the skewer is going to
be quite hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kick that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets a little sticky on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get that up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before we weigh that, we want to make
sure we're getting the temperature of our
[SPEAKER_00]: water relatively quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're going to assess the
temperature of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature of water has gone up,
as would be expected, to 27.3 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: 27.3 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, you don't want the very
bottom of the can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the bottom to just lift up that
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting the temperature of the
water itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to come back over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got to get the mass of that food
item.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put an empty wayboat here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to zero that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take our burnt food item.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're going to have a mass of only
0.60 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next food item on a wooden skewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my matches ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at trying to time this
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I light my match.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, you want to keep it at that
higher point in the match.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the flame is the hottest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work it back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll slowly rotate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep it just under that can there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, rotate it so you get as much of a
burn as possible out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see all that carbon buildup on the
aluminum can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to allow a little bit of a gap
there to be able to allow some oxygen for
[SPEAKER_00]: those flames to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's burning much longer than
our other item.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes, it's about completely burnt
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, there'll be a little bit of smoke
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to let that cool just for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get our wayboat and kind of make sure it's
not too, too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually they cool down pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to watch the metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kick that there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get that weighed in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to change too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we're going to go through and get our
temperature of our water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in comparison to when it started,
while this one did have a longer burn
[SPEAKER_00]: time, we're now looking at 42.9 degrees
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of that nice evaluation
there in the change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this gives you a little bit
of a basic idea of how to run the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry lab and looking at burning food
and being able to now take this data that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've collected with the temperature
change of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be able to go through some math
calculations to determine how much energy
[SPEAKER_00]: was in various food items.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can repeat this with many
different food items.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not just limited to what I've shown
you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wood skewer is a good idea to be able
to support it safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that this is a great
setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should also be doing repeated
trials because while it'd be different
[SPEAKER_00]: masses for your food, it should all come
out in the math because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: calculations you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But always good to have repeated trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun to think about too, if you have a
collection of snacks, which food item do
[SPEAKER_00]: you think has the most energy to be able
to go through and compare to see if your
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesis or your prediction was correct?
Thank you.
Thank you.
