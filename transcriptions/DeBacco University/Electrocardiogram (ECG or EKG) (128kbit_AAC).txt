[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at an
electrocardiogram, sometimes abbreviated
[SPEAKER_00]: ECG or EKG.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get an appreciation for
these little peaks and valleys and what
[SPEAKER_00]: these actually mean and how they indicate
what's normal for a properly beating
[SPEAKER_00]: heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting in syndrome, like other
muscles, the heart muscle contracts when
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulated and an EKG shows heart's
electrical activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's electricity actually moving
through the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the heart cells
depolarizing and repolarizing and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're seeing with these little kind
of peaks and valleys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all labeled and we're going to go
over each section and what it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: means.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good kind of general summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have something called a P wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the depolarization of the atria in
response to the SA node triggering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the PR interval here is a delay of
the AV node allowing the filling of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ventricles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The QRS complex is a depolarization of the
ventricles triggering the main pumping
[SPEAKER_00]: contractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice it's a big peak here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a main contraction phase here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The S to T region is the beginning of the
ventricle repolarization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be generally flat and the T wave
here is the ventricle repolarization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to look at these in just a
little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see these distinctive regions
are all labeled and so are certain
[SPEAKER_00]: segments and complexes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to kind of get that into motion,
we look at kind of our peaks and valleys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This I know presents it a little bit fast
but you're welcome to pause it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the heartbeat originates at the SA
node.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the cyanoatrial node, abbreviated SA
node.
[SPEAKER_00]: This spontaneously depolarizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This wave of depolarization spreads to the
atria causing them to contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the initial kind of signal here,
right there going right to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This second portion right here,
this is the AV node or the
[SPEAKER_00]: atrioventricular node.
[SPEAKER_00]: This passes the ventricles via the bundle
of hisses and is conducted rapidly over
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface of the ventricles in the
Purkinje fibers that we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ventricle contraction empties the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we notice here, our atria
contracting first and then followed by
[SPEAKER_00]: both of our ventricles contracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a diagram of the heart with all
the muscle removed just looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: basically the conducted nerve fibers here
in the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this kind of shows the waves that
are occurring simultaneously with the
[SPEAKER_00]: beating of the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now understanding an ECG here,
the P wave where the atria are full of
[SPEAKER_00]: blood and the SA node fires.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we see here with the P wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PQ segment is the time it takes the
signal to travel from the SA node to the
[SPEAKER_00]: AV node.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit of a delay there and
that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want the whole heart contracting
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on that, we have the QRS
complex and that's the firing of the AV
[SPEAKER_00]: node and the contraction of the
ventricles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, the ventricles have to pump
blood all the way to the lungs and the
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we see this large peak there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The R wave is the main mass of ventricles
contracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So specifically within the QRS complex,
that R wave is the main mass of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ventricles contracting followed by the ST
segment located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the interval between the ventricle
depolarization and repolarization.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a flat region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one just happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little bit of a delay process
leading to the T wave, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: repolarization of the ventricles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a slight increase there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the description I'm giving
you, there's also a couple other videos
[SPEAKER_00]: here that you're welcome to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: These electrical signals, again,
put in kind of a picture into colorization
[SPEAKER_00]: of the wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the SA node here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our first little bump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're having our impulse go into the
AV node.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that flat line here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we see the bundle branches carrying
the signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That signal is being passed down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All reaching all into the heart apex,
which is the bottom of the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when our ventricles contract,
this entire area, that's our big peak
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, tying in what's going on with
the actual heart, with the actual sections
[SPEAKER_00]: of this wave are very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting this in a little bit of more of a
circular form, you can see here it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: same basic PQRST sequence, just putting it
in a circular form, because again,
[SPEAKER_00]: it does reoccur again and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some representations here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Provide it in a circle, giving that
cyclical nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see the exact same sequence,
again, tied in with the PQRST waves and
[SPEAKER_00]: segments of the cardiac cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, these are becoming more popular,
more prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seen this sign at airports or
public areas called AED.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stands for automated external
defibrillator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a portable electronic device that
applies electricity, which stops the
[SPEAKER_00]: arrhythmia, allowing the heart to
reestablish an effective rhythm.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's great about these is they're fully
automated with simple audio and visual
[SPEAKER_00]: commands, and they're designed so
basically anyone can pick them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, their use of them is being taught
in many first aid and CPR classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've gone to one of those classes,
you may have had experience with these,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they are in very public areas,
and they do have a very stepwise
[SPEAKER_00]: walkthrough to walk you through the
process sequence here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have been familiar with these,
and this is a way we could restart the
[SPEAKER_00]: heart if someone did have a potential
heart issue in a public area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
