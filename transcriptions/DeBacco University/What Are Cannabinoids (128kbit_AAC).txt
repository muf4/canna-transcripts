[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
I'm gonna answer the simple question,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're gonna go investigate this in a
little detail, so hopefully you come along
[SPEAKER_00]: and are able to learn just what are
cannabinoids related to cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get to the main event,
why you probably came here, to answer the
[SPEAKER_00]: question, what are cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, we need to understand
there's something called
[SPEAKER_00]: photocannabinoids, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So photocannabinoids are a secondary
metabolite produced by many plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: liverworts, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they are producing the greatest
concentrations and variations in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photocannabinoids are bioactive
terpenoids, which were thought to be
[SPEAKER_00]: exclusive to cannabis sativa, but now have
also been discovered in rhododendron
[SPEAKER_00]: species, as well as some legumes,
liverworts genus, as well as some fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just cannabis, even though
here we are relating them to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: simply because they've been found to
produce the greatest concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some of those photocannabinoids here
might be familiar with, CBD, THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the two most famous ones,
but there's also CBC, THCA, CBG,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're involved in kind of the
neurological pathways and receptors of the
[SPEAKER_00]: human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get into cannabinoids or
photocannabinoids, what's the correct term
[SPEAKER_00]: to use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, photocannabinoids are any
cannabinoid that's produced in the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photocannabinoids are fatty acids
synthesized in the trichomes of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa and also in the trichomes of
multiple other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photocannabinoids interact with our body's
receptors to produce numerous therapeutic
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabinoids are a class of lipophilic
molecules that interact with the body's
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system, typically
abbreviated ECS.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, these are often used as
interchangeable terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endocannabinoids are what are produced in
animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the endocannabinoids,
and that's made by the body, because endo
[SPEAKER_00]: means within.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the photocannabinoids,
because photo means made by, photo,
[SPEAKER_00]: made by plants, the photosynthetic
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have the endocannabinoids,
which are brain-derived, the
[SPEAKER_00]: photocannabinoids, and then we also can't
forget about synthetic cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are from a pharmaceutical lab
created.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all interact with the endocannabinoid
receptors of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of like oversimplify that we
have CB1 and CB2 receptors, different
[SPEAKER_00]: shapes because shape determines function.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we bind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we're looking at the
importance of the shape of these molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: for their interaction with the body's
neurological system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So properties, our photocannabinoids are
mostly insoluble in water, but are soluble
[SPEAKER_00]: in alcohol and fat and other nonpolar
organic solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fats being a lipid, those are nonpolar.
[SPEAKER_00]: In alkaline conditions, they can form
water soluble phenyl salts, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially phenols.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the phenol groups are represented
either by this or look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to take you back to a little
biology, polar versus nonpolar solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polar solvents are like water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a kind of positive and negative
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nonpolar solvents are kind of like the,
they don't really have a charge there in
[SPEAKER_00]: separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no charge separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're polar as a partial positive and
negative charge is observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just kind of look at some of the
physical properties of these cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just an overview of the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, probably familiar with
THC, CBN, CBG, CBD, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overview of the cannabinoids here derived
in different kind of backbone areas here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black structures here in the black
outlines have been isolated from natural
[SPEAKER_00]: sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue structures located right over here
have not been found in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are kind of your alcohol
derivatives there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the reason why I show this is
just shape determines function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really important to understand
the shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to know the shape,
we can not really provide a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: information here, but just to kind of give
you that information so you have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have side chain cannabinoids,
which are SC cannabinoids, typically
[SPEAKER_00]: abbreviated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, side change cannabinoids
of cannabis sativa can be divided into 10
[SPEAKER_00]: general groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are some of those we might be
more familiar with, or the Delta-9,
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta-8, THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, CBD, CBC, CBG, these are all
also could be classified as what's called
[SPEAKER_00]: side chain cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why are cannabinoids produced?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a great kind of step away picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, plants produce cannabinoids as a
form of defense against insect feeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: or stressful environmental conditions,
which can include UV light, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: water stress in the form of desiccation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The human body produces cannabinoids also
for survival through activation of
[SPEAKER_00]: homeostasis, which is that balancing
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have our cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our photocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of need to have this like check
and balance system to maintain the
[SPEAKER_00]: all-inclusive important homeostasis within
any living system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, connecting cannabinoids to humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids are bioactive in human beings
in the sense that they bind to the
[SPEAKER_00]: endogenous cannabinoid system,
or ECS, which results in the plethora of
[SPEAKER_00]: physiological responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The effect of these drugs can treat many
different diseases ranging from
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation to anxiety and many others.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll cover some more of these in other
videos, but just kind of give you that
[SPEAKER_00]: basic understanding here of just what
cannabinoids are beyond just recognizing
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this provides some more detailed
information for you.
