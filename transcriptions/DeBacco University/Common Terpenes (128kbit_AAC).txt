[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has a particular terpene they
might be more interested in and here on
[SPEAKER_00]: DeBacco University there are specific
videos on terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This video though is looking at just
common terpenes, looking at providing with
[SPEAKER_00]: some great information.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a general overview looking at the
common terpenes so you can develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: better understanding in general of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have interest in one or two in
particular, search the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might find some more detailed
information on that particular terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: that is of interest to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's go over some common
terpenes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hear a lot about terpene profiles
and profile charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this table or wheel provide an easy
visual understanding in general which
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes produce particular effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might hear a full spectrum terpene
profile that's basically producing a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of all the terpenes or partial
spectrum terpene profile where only a few
[SPEAKER_00]: select ones might be present in a
particular end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So terpenes in temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So terpenes have different molecular
structures so their boiling points will
[SPEAKER_00]: vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some terpenes require high boiling points
to turn into vapor while others are
[SPEAKER_00]: ineffective at high temperatures with the
same holding true for cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example that THC's boiling
point is 315 degrees Fahrenheit and
[SPEAKER_00]: Linnell's boiling point is 388 degrees
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a comparison, if you're familiar with
other terpenes, we could see some here,
[SPEAKER_00]: pinene, very low temperature, relatively
speaking, compared to THCV having a very
[SPEAKER_00]: high temperature here for boiling points
of different compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this does play into a factor,
particularly those looking at turning them
[SPEAKER_00]: into a vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: What temperature you have that vapor set
at is going to impact the availability
[SPEAKER_00]: potential of the effect that you may be
getting from that particular terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a little bit more difficult to
get pinene and THCV activated at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time because of just the span of
temperatures that they have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see a THCV and the kind of other
colder temperatures to warmer temperatures
[SPEAKER_00]: here, relatively speaking, all pretty hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about degrees Fahrenheit
considering water boils at 212.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's just some more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the goal here is to provide you
with some great information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll shrink myself down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put myself right up here in the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to pause the video or
always look in the description for a link
[SPEAKER_00]: to the slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as resources, if you want to
download any of these yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're more than welcome to.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just to provide you with that
general guide in comparing different
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, more videos on this channel will
cover them in a little bit more detail,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this just gives you a nice general
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also some common terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are ones that will be discussed in
other videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of that quick visual.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of these you want to research
further, search the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you'll find a video with some
more information that you find helpful for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when scouring the internet,
there can be helpful information and there
[SPEAKER_00]: can also be inaccurate or what's basically
unhelpful information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that indica sativa only has
to do with plant morphology and not
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about indicas and
sativas, yes, taller, slimmer,
[SPEAKER_00]: longer leaves are sativas, shorter bushier
plants that are often wider are indicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're talking about head highs versus
body highs, sleep aids, creativity,
[SPEAKER_00]: daytime, nighttime use, none of this has
any validity comparing an indica to a
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica sativa only has to do with the
morphology, not the chemical profile of
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at this research article here to
get into some more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another great research article to
kind of look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the information was pulled from
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to look at it for yourself,
here is the proper citation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see again some more charts and
comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great research article here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here we're seeing some more charts and
comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just presented on that research
table looking at pharmacological activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: synergistic cannabinoids, as well as where
you commonly may encounter them,
[SPEAKER_00]: the general structure and the terpenoid
name listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chart was a little big to put on just one
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one slide and this is the
second slide there giving you the full
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of gamut of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind some are not well completely
understood, but definitely gives you at
[SPEAKER_00]: least a good starting point as well as
many of these discussed in other videos
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now common terpenes for the ones,
if you really want to learn about them in
[SPEAKER_00]: more detail, these are individually
covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably just type in one of these
names into the search on this channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be able to find the information
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, as far as a comparison,
quick little rundown of the terpene,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're likely to find it,
therapeutic effects, and the aroma
[SPEAKER_00]: typically associated with that particular
terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, great interest in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this provides you.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a little more information.
