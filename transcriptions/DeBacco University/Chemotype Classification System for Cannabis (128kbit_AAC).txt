[SPEAKER_00]: All right, in this tobacco university
video, here we're looking at chemotype
[SPEAKER_00]: classification system for cannabis,
looking at the different chemotypes as a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to classify certain cannabis types
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this video lecture, I'll be
reviewing this particular reference
[SPEAKER_00]: article provided here with a copy of the
first page, a resource link, and also a
[SPEAKER_00]: direct link there if you want to look at
this in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, why chemotype
classification?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are growers utilizing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it allows for the screening of
germoplasm, planned targeting breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: strategies, which is great way to kind of
direct a breeding project to reduce time
[SPEAKER_00]: lost, identification of potential novel
cultivars or strains, and potential
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in quality, safety, efficiency
demanded by the pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these are great positives,
which is why some growers are selecting to
[SPEAKER_00]: go through classification based on
chemotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's three main chemotypes
explained.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be as much as five, but these are
going to be the three main ones presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see the three main chemotypes here
involve the THC and CBD ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, chemotype one here,
we're looking at favoring that THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning greater weight is kind of given to
that THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be more THC in comparison
to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemotype two strain is going to be kind
of a balanced or kind of an equal amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then chemotype three is going to be
favoring the CBD end of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chemotypes four is considered to be CBG
dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And five has no cannabinoids at all,
favoring more of the terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a single A and B locus genetic model
governing cannabis cannabinoid composition
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis sativa is being looked at
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black lines indicate alternative
cannabinoid biosynthetic pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at the formation of some
of these compounds, understanding how the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant produces them and what pathways it's
utilizing can help us provide that greater
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The arrows here are corresponding to the
associated cannabinoid accumulation of
[SPEAKER_00]: said chemotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see here how they're
classified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this has a nice little visual here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is looking more at the synthesis and
the locus progression there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the cannabinoid comparison by those
chemotypes, and these are by the three
[SPEAKER_00]: main chemotypes here, one, two,
and three, focusing mainly on the CBD and
[SPEAKER_00]: the THC, and also indicating as well,
and there's dark lines here, the CBG
[SPEAKER_00]: total.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phenocannabinoid composition within the
cannabinoid fraction of individual
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis sativa plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was derived from 22 accessions
indicating variability both within and
[SPEAKER_00]: between accessions and chemotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this kind of mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see some general trends here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at chemotype two in the center
here, one is on the right and three is on
[SPEAKER_00]: the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, don't read this from left to
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemotype two is in the center and we can
see the comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, look at the colorations and the
shading differences that we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at chemotype one, we can see that
there is a strong favoritism here for the
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of THC over all of the examples
provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemotype two, as I said, it's more
balanced, but some can be more favoring
[SPEAKER_00]: the THC, some can be more favoring the
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it is balanced, it's not a
guaranteed 50-50 split.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then chemotype three, we see here a
favoring strongly towards the CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now gas chromatic profiles, what does this
kind of look like if we were to kind of go
[SPEAKER_00]: through the scientific testing here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is looking at all five
chemotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that chemotype one is THC
dominant, two is a CBD and THC mix,
[SPEAKER_00]: three is CBD dominant, four is CBG
dominant, and five has no cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the gas chromatograph profiles of the
different chemotypes of cannabis sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: are presented right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research proposed the creation of that
chemotype five or that zero cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not yet clear whether this
cannabinoid absence was due to metabolic
[SPEAKER_00]: block or a very limited formation of the
glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just an important note to make
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The site of synthesis and accumulation of
cannabinoids, when we're looking at that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of chemotype five, where there's no
cannabinoids present, where we only see
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of those terpenes being produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see again listed, we see the
different peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily they're all labeled for greater
and easier visual understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemotype one, that prevalence of THC,
we see a strong THC spike there with
[SPEAKER_00]: basically no CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, when we're looking at our
chemotype two, we see a little bit more of
[SPEAKER_00]: an evening blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this particular example, a little bit
more of the CBD compared to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemotype three, we see that strong peak
there for CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemotype four, that is favoring,
of course, that CBG, but we also see that
[SPEAKER_00]: the CBD is present as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chemotype five, that kind of
interesting one there, where there's
[SPEAKER_00]: really no CBD, CBG, or THC, we're focusing
mainly there on the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, again, just another
interesting way to be looking at cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically looking at the chemotypes and
defining the different classifications of
[SPEAKER_00]: those related to cannabis.
