[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at the analysis
of inks, particularly in pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you may think they're all the
same, there's actually some unique
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics and identifiable
characteristics that can be applied to
[SPEAKER_00]: forensic science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, just a general ink
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get this kind of container here
with a bunch of pens, well, inks in
[SPEAKER_00]: question documents may be examined and
compared with other inks of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: document or with ink in other documents,
even with ink that's in seized pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important to consider
collecting, if you're collecting evidence,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be collecting pens from the area of the
crime scene, because the goal is to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine where the similarities and
differences potentially may exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about comparing
inks, if an old document has newer ink or
[SPEAKER_00]: alterations to that ink, it could be
determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at kind of the straight copy
here, everything looks the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's certain techniques that we can
do to determine what might be a different
[SPEAKER_00]: ink, what might be a new ink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can allow us to see some changes
that may have been made in a questioned
[SPEAKER_00]: document.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just in general, well, what is ink?
[SPEAKER_00]: Inks are a complex mixture of colors and
additives in a simple diagram describing
[SPEAKER_00]: the selective reflectance of a pigment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have kind of, we'll say white light
with all wavelengths hitting our ink
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absorbing these different colors and
reflecting, in this case, the blue color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll interpret that as blue ink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we look at a little more technical
kind of terms to identify ink components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientists can use infrared or mass spec
or chromatography in both the glass gas or
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can help determine a signature to
that ink, what particular components and
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients are being used to specifically
identify that one particular ink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why would we have this high degree
of specificity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's actually an international
ink library where a lot of the inks from
[SPEAKER_00]: different manufacturers are stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's maintained by the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secret Service and the International
Revenue Service, includes more than 9,500
[SPEAKER_00]: inks dating back to the 1920s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year, pen and ink manufacturers are
asked to submit a new ink if they have new
[SPEAKER_00]: formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a giant library of inks that
can allow pinpointing of if a pen was used
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to identify what time period that
pen came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how that might be able to impact the
materials found at the crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are chemically tested and added to
the reference for collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what develops this library,
which allows for this great database to be
[SPEAKER_00]: used for comparison when we're trying to
identify certain inks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
