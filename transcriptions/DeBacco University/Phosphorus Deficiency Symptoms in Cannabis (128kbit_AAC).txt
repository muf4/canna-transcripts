[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at phosphorus
deficiency symptoms in a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the element phosphorus here,
we see what a normal leaf should look like
[SPEAKER_00]: and phosphorus is mined and shipped large
quantities all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at what the
deficiency symptoms in cannabis look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we should first realize its plant
importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, why does a plant even need
phosphorus to begin with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember it is a mobile nutrients that
will move through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a vital component for phosphorus
bonds in the nucleic acids of DNA and RNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: so important to the vital main structure
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also part of ATP, adenosine
triphosphate, which is the energy unit of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got some very important components
to be incorporated for the plant to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the growth factors that
phosphorus is associated with,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually stimulate root development,
increase stalk and stem strength,
[SPEAKER_00]: and improve flower formation and seed
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's typically for cannabis
associated with high levels in its bloom
[SPEAKER_00]: associated fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the trial was conducted, so this is
kind of a rare opportunity to see in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis what a phosphorus deficiency
actually looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some of the backgrounds of the
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kultivar's wife, which is high in CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's these plants that you're going to see
about 80 days old.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were grown in a greenhouse,
so the conditions were kept very
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see a control plant that was fed
the optimum rate of nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the test plant, which was
phosphorus deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a phosphorus deficient cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The early growth will stun if P deficiency
occurs, so you don't have that quite
[SPEAKER_00]: robust and vigorous growth to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to be kind of subtle in mature
plants, but since it's mobile,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to look towards the lower or
older leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one circled here in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus can be translocated into buds
during development because it is that
[SPEAKER_00]: mobile nutrient, so it can move throughout
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those lower leaves are the most likely
ones to show deficiency if it does occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a nice comparison between that
same phosphorus deficient plant we saw and
[SPEAKER_00]: what a normal balanced fertilizer plant
received.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a white wall in the background and
a green door to kind of give you a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of that color balance there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quick look doesn't show really a major
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key is that yellowing leaf down here
at the center of the phosphorus deficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: image.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's characteristic of a deficiency of
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now kind of zoomed into that leaf,
we could see, you don't expect that purple
[SPEAKER_00]: coloration that can be seen in corn and
other plants, and a lot of girls think
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll see in purple stalk, oh,
it's automatically a phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be associated with other field
stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a plant that literally was fed
phosphorus deficient fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can see what it actually means.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an actual cannabis plant example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those lower leaves is where you want to
look.
[SPEAKER_00]: That faint green color to that yellowing,
that can often lead to kind of browning,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we're starting to see here in extreme
cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of zoomed in version of the
leaf here, even in a controlled experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's a known phosphorus
deficiency, the actual opinions cannot be
[SPEAKER_00]: very dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not one of those that jumps out right
at you and says, wow, purple coloration or
[SPEAKER_00]: really light green or yellow or browning
or burning, kind of subtle kind of is the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This lack of obvious visual cues is part
of why growers are fearful of the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're worried they're not going to see
it, so they always want to over add
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the common fertilizers would be added,
even though it's typically not needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manures, if you're going in field
applications, can vary based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: source.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at cow or chicken or horse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be mindful of the bedding that's used,
because that can affect nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus also adds organic matter when
it's added in the form of manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cons, it can often be over added,
which can cause some issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triple super phosphate, zero, 45,
zero, so 45% phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually based on a soil test, you're going
to be adding that, that middle number
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very concentrated phosphorus, and the
downfall is that it does lack some other
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bloom fertilizers in general, as you can
see here, follow the recommended rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically very high in percent of
phosphorus, that middle number,
[SPEAKER_00]: and often leads to an excess supply of
phosphorus in plants, which a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: growers I don't think realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I make this phosphorus kind
of warning here is it is mined kind of in
[SPEAKER_00]: large areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most growers overfeed phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they even realize that
they're overfeeding the phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they have a fear of not having
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real issue of overfeeding for growers
are wasting resources that are being more
[SPEAKER_00]: limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the graph here,
US mined rock phosphate from 1900 to 2015,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see a major ramp up, and then the
mind in the United States for rock
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphate is decreased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people would associate this with
we're using less.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if we look during that same time,
look at the United States net imports of
[SPEAKER_00]: rock phosphate, we could see imports are
on the increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though we were mining a lot,
a lot of it was being exported,
[SPEAKER_00]: now we've kind of flipped, and now we're
starting to import more simply because
[SPEAKER_00]: we're running out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by over-applying, you're wasting a
limiting resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you've seen my other kind of
videos, you might see the nitrogen one in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also show a toxicity image for
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really no toxic image because it
really doesn't have any key factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many growers override phosphorus and
aren't realizing it because there's not
[SPEAKER_00]: that obvious sign of toxicity or
overfeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: High levels though can vastly reduce the
effectiveness of mycorrhizae or the
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial fungi for the root system in
the root zone of the plants, not to
[SPEAKER_00]: mention the wasting of a limited nutrient,
the increased cost, and the potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: groundwater contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most growers are fearful of a
deficiency and most growers actually end
[SPEAKER_00]: up in a toxicity range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be mindful and aware of what it
takes for phosphorus and the deficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms and what they look like,
and just be mindful of how much fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: you're actually adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
