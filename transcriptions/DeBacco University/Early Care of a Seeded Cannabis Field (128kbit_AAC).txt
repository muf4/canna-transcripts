[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video
investigating early care of seeded
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see an example of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this looks like just a field here with
some drip lines, but there are actual
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants planted here with the drip
irrigation and a living cover down between
[SPEAKER_00]: the rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's investigate some of the details
associated with this cannabis field here
[SPEAKER_00]: on Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the video here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, when we're looking at
cannabis field or really any field,
[SPEAKER_00]: the preparation is an important part of
the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the seeding of a field is the last step
after much needed field preparation have
[SPEAKER_00]: been completed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone wants to get in and start with
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that the field is
ready before you even think about
[SPEAKER_00]: planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil disturbance should be minimal as
this can be important for the germination
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to go through and plant a bunch
of seeds and then go through and mess up
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil because you'll be damaging what
you've worked so hard to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early on during the process, root
development is just starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure to avoid the seedlings from
drying out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case here, we're using drip
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to run it potentially a
little bit longer to ensure this very
[SPEAKER_00]: small area where the root is is actually
getting adequate water or irrigation to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ensure the water is reaching the actual
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ensure this small root zone is getting
sufficient moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can be accomplished by a simple
field check and making sure you're running
[SPEAKER_00]: and have something installed ahead of time
or shortly after you go through and add
[SPEAKER_00]: the seedlings here to ensure that they are
going to be getting adequate moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with any planting, you always want to
be sure that you're watching for weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early on, cannabis plants are not very
competitive with weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure your weed control
is good throughout the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: but especially early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed control just prior to planting is
important because this will increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: odds of successfully newly emerged
cannabis seedlings to develop what's
[SPEAKER_00]: called a good field stand or a good amount
of plants within your field there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly here, we want to be mindful of if
you need to overplant because you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: daisha seeds, meaning 50% will be male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feminized seeds is encouraged,
but still be on the lookout for potential
[SPEAKER_00]: rogue male plant when it gets closer to
flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're using feminized seed that
states 99% female, this means one out of
[SPEAKER_00]: every hundred plants will be male on
average.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing a large number of
plants, that can be a large number of
[SPEAKER_00]: males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically you're growing them in a
very efficient manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a couple males in a field,
that could potentially lead to a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeded and a lot of successful
pollination, thus reducing your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, again, if you're using
feminized seed, great, but even if 99% or
[SPEAKER_00]: 99.5%, that is not 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should still be scanning your
fields at flowering time.
So thank you for your attention.
Thank you.
