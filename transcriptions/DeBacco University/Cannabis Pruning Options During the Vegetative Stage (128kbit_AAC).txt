[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
we'll be going over cannabis pruning
[SPEAKER_00]: options, things you might want to
consider, as well as some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: advantages and disadvantages so you can
select the best pruning method that fits
[SPEAKER_00]: your growing situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into cannabis pruning
options during the vegetative stage of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the general concept of
pruning is that it directs the plant to be
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient with its production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different methods can direct the plant to
best match the given growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're trying to do is eliminate any
unwanted parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by removing these unneeded plant areas,
this can help reduce the chance for
[SPEAKER_00]: disease by simply increasing air flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can also increase the yield of
wanted plant components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, these lower leaves here
could breed disease, could help reduce air
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: By removing those, we can get a plant that
can maximize the light exposure reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of disease, and hopefully also
maximize our yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pruning techniques covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in this video, I'm just going to give
the simple advantages and disadvantages of
[SPEAKER_00]: each.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you search this channel,
you should be able to find more detailed
[SPEAKER_00]: videos on each of these pruning methods
here, such as topping, sea of greens,
[SPEAKER_00]: screen of green, the thin technique,
super cropping, lollipop, and not pruning
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What will happen with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, if you're looking or
considering plant topping, also consider
[SPEAKER_00]: what we call tipping or pinching the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage is it's really easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can see here, you take the,
find that main stock and you just
[SPEAKER_00]: basically top it or pinch it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is that it limits the
number of branch points that you can have
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're getting basically from one,
we're going to two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're essentially doubling that,
but really we can see that when this is
[SPEAKER_00]: pinched, we'll determine how we grow those
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could be part or integrated as
part of other techniques, but true topping
[SPEAKER_00]: or pinching is really just removing that
top apical meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the sea of green, this helps improved
yields and allows for a quicker harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, basically it creates a
sea or a kind of a good solid canopy of
[SPEAKER_00]: all the plant tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage though, it's not a good
option for limited plant grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning if you can only grow a couple
plants, not really kind of the option
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also reduced effectiveness is the
plant can grow unevenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what we're trying to create
here, it's kind of that kind of solid
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy of buds here with kind of really
quickly turn around, quick turnaround
[SPEAKER_00]: times for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comparing that to the screen of green
technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this can be applied to many
different strains, but tends to work best
[SPEAKER_00]: for those that have long, tall in a leggy
habit, such as sativa morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage is it really does maximize
the space that each plant can take up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often also offers even light exposure for
all buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're looking here, we have one
plant, we're basically printing it out so
[SPEAKER_00]: that it spreads out this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called the screen of green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reason being, it typically involves some
sort of mesh screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That mesh screen does require to be set up
ahead of time and needs to be timed well
[SPEAKER_00]: with the plant growth rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greater space is needed per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a disadvantage of this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, unlike the sea of green,
where you're kind of printing all your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to be smaller and quicker
turnaround times, this can be more
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous also if you're looking at
limited number of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take one plant, you can really
spread it out over a large area,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it does take a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the fin technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: This technique is typically used along
with other pruning techniques to maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: both methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically the screen of green and sea of
green pruning methods will be incorporated
[SPEAKER_00]: with this potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage is it's very similar to
topping in the sense that you are pinching
[SPEAKER_00]: a portion of the plant here, but instead
it promotes a bushier growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can maximize those looking to clone a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because instead of just pinching the plant
and getting two, you're pinching it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: way that basically allows multiple branch
points to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This encourages lateral side branching,
which can make for a denser plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants will often require staking,
so be mindful of that if you're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: adopting this pruning method.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not advised for autoflowers because
this delay of this time it takes to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce these other branches, this delay
in plant growth is best to kind of hold
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in vegetative state for four to six
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: With autoflowers, when you have that
dedicated number of days until harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: that delay can offset the plant timing and
reduce your overall yields per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also have supercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see kind of it's like we're not
breaking the plant here, we're bending it
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty aggressively here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can produce high yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows more light penetration down here
deeper in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also helps reduce plant height without
removing plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a plant that's getting
really close to a light, you can supercrop
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're basically bending it right over.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is it does require a bit
of technique because if done wrong,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant yields will suffer in the sense
that you're breaking the plant's off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be a disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage point where you're kind of
pinching it, getting it to here,
[SPEAKER_00]: looks pretty severe and it kind of is,
but this plant will continue to grow here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not breaking it at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also stressful to the plant,
so timing and care should correlate with
[SPEAKER_00]: this pruning method.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't always want to go through into
supercrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure you're timing things
and reducing plant stresses as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the lollipop method and the
goal here is to maximize the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often used with this screen of green
technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets the name lollipopping because
you're basically taking all of the lower
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it looks like a bunch of
sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of get that big bulge at the top
there, so it sort of looks like a
[SPEAKER_00]: lollipop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is it requires repeated
rounds of pruning and leaf removal,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is relatively labor intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it here as well, but the goal
here is that the leaves will be maximized
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of sun or light exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then lastly, mentioned here, just what if
you choose not to prune your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's an easy method because there's
basically no work involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's why some growers do choose
it, but the disadvantage is it reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: plant efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also increase plant diseases
because it's so dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's leaves on top of leaves,
so keep that in mind that if you are not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to prune your cannabis plant,
you could be getting more diseases,
[SPEAKER_00]: more insect pressure, and basically not
making the plant as efficient as it could
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this brief explanation of the
advantages and disadvantages of each was
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's one you want to learn more
about, search this channel and hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll have some more detail provided for
each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
