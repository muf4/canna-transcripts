[SPEAKER_00]: Okay I know it can be hard to teach an old
dog new tricks but in this case I want you
[SPEAKER_00]: to get away from the Punnett squares
you're so familiar and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable with and start to learn this
forked line method.
[SPEAKER_00]: See Punnett squares are represented here
but this forked line method is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient way and a great way to handle
larger crosses because in this case we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to use the example of a tri-hybrid
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know you thought the fun started
stopped with di-hybrid crosses but it only
[SPEAKER_00]: just began there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now into tri-hybrid crosses and this
forked line method will make it a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: easier once you fully understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tri-hybrid cross example we're going to
use this forked line method and it builds
[SPEAKER_00]: on what we learned with di-hybrid crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the foil method where we're
distributing our gametes here so our first
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, inside, and last and that's how
we're going to distribute the gametes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be also familiar with the
monohybrid cross because we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: build upon that with our tri-hybrid cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to do a tri-hybrid cross
with a Punnett square it looks like this
[SPEAKER_00]: complex mess here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to try to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our problem is a pollinating plant has
a genotype big A little A, big B big B,
[SPEAKER_00]: big C little C is crossed with another
plant with a genotype which is homozygous
[SPEAKER_00]: recessive for A, heterozygous for B,
and heterozygous for C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is what's the expected
genotype frequencies of the offspring or
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds produced?
[SPEAKER_00]: And hint this is going to take a
tri-hybrid cross because there's three
[SPEAKER_00]: different traits looking at here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again if you do a Punnett square it
looks like this very complex mess here and
[SPEAKER_00]: your odds for error are very high and we
want to try to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So step one here's our cross we want to
know what seeds can be produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to simplify the tri-hybrid cross
into three monohybrid crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully not too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is going to involve the A
allele, second for the B, third for the C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember Punnett squares could also be
used for the monohybrid crosses but we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to focus on the FOIL method it's a
little bit easier to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at producing a plant
crossing two plants together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So step two the expected genotype
frequencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I colorized them here so if you're
colorblind I'm sorry but for A is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: represent green, B's are going to be in
blue, and C's will be in red here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at just the A's.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were just to cross those together we
have our heterozygous with our homozygous
[SPEAKER_00]: recesses and our resulting offspring would
be half would be heterozygous,
[SPEAKER_00]: half would be homozygous recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too bad right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is the same thing for the B's.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're looking at the B's now we
still have our A's over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got our homozygous dominant with
our heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cross these together in a monohybrid
cross way we would have half being the
[SPEAKER_00]: homozygous dominant and half being
heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: C's get a little more complicated with
both heterozygous so if we look at the C's
[SPEAKER_00]: now we cross two of our heterozygous C's.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a quarter being homozygous
dominant, half being heterozygous,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a quarter being homozygous recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so now what do we do with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: The possible genotype combinations now
requires the pairing of genotypes from all
[SPEAKER_00]: the monohybrid crosses previously
completed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just took those simple boxes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to progress those to the next
step.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the possible gametes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be in the egg or in this case
the pollen grain because we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the first one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start with R resulting from the A
alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half would be heterozygous, half would be
homozygous recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got to include the B's.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we bring in the B's now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half would be big B, big B, half would be
big B little b.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing here, also needs to apply to
the homozygous recessive ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half would be homozygous dominant,
half would be heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of following along so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can flip back or pause me at any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here now we're going to go and progress to
the C's.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're including the C's now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember those had three different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a quarter, a half, a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again a quarter being homozygous dominant,
half being heterozygous, and a quarter
[SPEAKER_00]: being homozygous recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we need to do in order to get the
C genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: This reason why this is called the forked
line method is it's a forked line and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to go through and we're just
going to work these right across.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a half, a half, and a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a half, a half, and a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice a half times a half times a
quarter is a sixteenth and we also carry
[SPEAKER_00]: this genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our heterozygous for A
represented right here, homozygous
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant here, and homozygous dominant for
C here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice I did that with the same thing as
we carry our way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: A half, a half, and a half, half,
half, half would be one eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we carry also those alleles with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here also, carry those through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we notice we develop this nice seed
genotype for this trihybrid cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very complex, but if you break it
apart into the individual steps,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can follow back and see where
everything comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, getting back to the question,
I don't know if you still remember it,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the expected genotype frequencies
of the offspring or seeds produced?
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be the expected genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these are fractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can easily convert these to percents.
[SPEAKER_00]: A sixteenth, divide that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One divided by sixteen times a hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we add all of these possible seed
genotypes up, we notice we get a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: percent, which is what we should get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a way to check yourself when you're
looking at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go through, add up all the percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get to a hundred percent,
you know you have all the possible
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this was a relatively easy way
to understand the forked line method.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I do have another video that is a
little bit more simplified.
[SPEAKER_00]: It follows the same steps and you're
welcome to check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put a link in the description along
with the citations for all the pictures
[SPEAKER_00]: and information that I used.
Thank you.
