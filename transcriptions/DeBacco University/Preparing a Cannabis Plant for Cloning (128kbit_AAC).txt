[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so now you've selected that
plant for cloning, and now you've come to
[SPEAKER_00]: Tobacco University to learn how to prepare
that cannabis plant for the cloning
[SPEAKER_00]: process, and that's what we're going to
provide here on this video lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into how to prepare a
cannabis plant for cloning here at Tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, the chosen one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once the plant is chosen, the grower
should make some adjustments to help
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure maximum clone yield from that
particular plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, we're looking at having
a lot of those shoot tips, a lot of those
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative propagation points to allow
multiple clones to be generated from that
[SPEAKER_00]: original plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So younger plants typically are easier to
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a choice between a younger
and older plant, typically the younger
[SPEAKER_00]: plant would be preferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, oftentimes it's not until the
harvest time that plant's full potential
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually realized, and that's when the
grower determines they want to go through
[SPEAKER_00]: and clone that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's identified, the chosen plant
should be placed in a vegetative light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle for about 18 to 20 hours of a
continuous light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant was in active flowering
stage, this will delay the transition back
[SPEAKER_00]: to the vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, for timing purposes as growers,
just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're up potting the plant here,
so again, we have our chosen plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go through this kind of
general up potting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, since a plant for cloning will be a
mother or stock plant, many growers elect
[SPEAKER_00]: to put the plant into larger containers to
reduce the overall stress and allow the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to get larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this could be at any stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically we'll have a soilless media as
we see here, put the original container in
[SPEAKER_00]: there so we know it's going to be a good
fit to allow good soil media contact with
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots to ensure that there's no air
pockets there to cause drying,
[SPEAKER_00]: want to have that root transition to the
larger pot very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a good little technique to go
through when you're up potting that
[SPEAKER_00]: original plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the pruning method that you're
choosing to use may have to change
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to your original once you
determine that plant that you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go through this process with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal for a plant to be cloned is to
produce many branches as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often this may lead to different
methods of pruning might be implemented
[SPEAKER_00]: because now your goal is to create as many
little branch points as possible and not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily grow a plant to produce the
maximum number of buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have definitely a lot of
branches, want to be selective with our
[SPEAKER_00]: pruning methods, selective with our
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: The method that we go through to help
maximize the number of clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get off a single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fertilizers to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while you want to keep the plant
healthy, do not overfeed it as this will
[SPEAKER_00]: make the cloning or rooting process much
more of a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is particularly important in the case
of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever nutrients you might be adding,
look at the kind of levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to always, yes, to fertilize,
but be mindful in particularly of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you over nitrogen feed a plant,
it'll grow very quickly, but it'll become
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of spacey internode spacing wise,
and it will be much harder to root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you want to be scouting for pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the plant healthy is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have a couple of insects listed
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also pertains to disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also pertains to light stress,
nutrient stress, water stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: all things to take into consideration and
to make sure that you're having those at a
[SPEAKER_00]: very stable levels so you're not stressing
the plant out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, you want to shift the plant to an
isolated location.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to keep the plant in an
isolated area to limit the chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination with other plants that you
may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where a grow tent can be a
great environment to help isolate that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, to allow you to do certain things
to that plant, to help maximize,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, the ability for it to be cloned.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might require a slightly different
environment or conditions that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing your other plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a grow tent, in this case, if you're
only doing one plant, is a great option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, an isolated room would be an
option for larger scale growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
