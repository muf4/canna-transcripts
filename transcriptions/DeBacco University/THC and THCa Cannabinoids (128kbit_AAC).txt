[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tobacco University video,
we'll be covering THC and THCA
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids to provide you with a little
bit more detail on these, so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: develop a better appreciation for this
particular cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might be wondering what the
difference between THC and THCA is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here we see them in the basic
chemical structure, and THCA basically has
[SPEAKER_00]: this additional group added on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that's the chemical difference
at the molecular level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great research article here
where we're looking at, it goes into a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of detail on many cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This video lecture, we're going to focus
on THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's the famous one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is one of the most recognized
cannabinoids ever to be discovered,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like the Taj Mahal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show a picture, everyone knows what
that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there are multiple compounds in
cannabis that offer medicinal benefits,
[SPEAKER_00]: and many more that modulate the impact of
THC, there are none with such psychoactive
[SPEAKER_00]: impact as THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's kind of the most
famous one, because it has such a unique
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is that effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, kind of the effect with THC after
consuming decarboxylated THCA or THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: and high doses can cause near
hallucinations for some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the effect is not technically
intoxicating, it is certainly abbreviating
[SPEAKER_00]: and very often psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some effects of acute marijuana
intoxication.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see some of the after effects of
consuming a cannabis spud here that has a
[SPEAKER_00]: high amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here it says consuming decarboxylated
THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's decarboxylated, it goes to the
Delta 9 THC, many people are familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the molecule that started the war.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the cannabinoid that is the target
of now fading drug war, which
[SPEAKER_00]: characterized cannabis as a dangerous and
addictive drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the absence of THCA, there may never
have been a drug war against cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just kind of an interesting
component of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really the molecule that the plant
produced that really caused a lot of this
[SPEAKER_00]: drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of developing companies such as the
farmer and the felon, things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: DEA going after plants, and the federal
level being set at what it is for the
[SPEAKER_00]: specific THC molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the original source?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, THC, believe it or not, the original
source is CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA likes CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBDA synthesized from CBGA in the
apoplastic space of the secretory vesicle
[SPEAKER_00]: within the trichome structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The enzyme that does the work is THCase or
THC synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there is a peroxide byproduct,
which is toxic to the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore THCase or THC synthase
biosynthesis must occur in the trichome of
[SPEAKER_00]: the secretory vesicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking kind of visual of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's our CBGA and then it's THCA
and also CBG is being derived from that
[SPEAKER_00]: single molecule, kind of like the original
molecule, the stem cell molecule,
[SPEAKER_00]: that through enzymatic actions and other
plant functions can then be made to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce these various compounds,
all occurring within the trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So THC and regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're looking at current regulations
that require all CBD hemp flowers with a
[SPEAKER_00]: THC content greater than 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are classified as marijuana and must
be destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few exceptions to the rule of
THCase producing THCA and CBDAS producing
[SPEAKER_00]: CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a couple of exceptions,
but pretty much all cannabis hemp equal to
[SPEAKER_00]: or less than 0.3% THC, marijuana greater
than 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC being that molecule that causes the
categorization of that plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get into biological expectations
versus regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, research from Oregon CBD Company has
shown that in vitro, CBDAS will produce
[SPEAKER_00]: one part THCA for every 20 parts of CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because with the cannabinoid content
of hemp exceeding 20%, it may be totally
[SPEAKER_00]: unreasonable to have the THCA content
requirement set to 0.3% or less,
[SPEAKER_00]: simply because we can biologically expect
a minimum of 1% THCA for every 20% of CBDA
[SPEAKER_00]: produced by the CBDA synthase,
the required synthase for CBDA production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of this, this means that if
we're getting these cannabinoids so high,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant has to convert a certain
percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for exceeding 20% cannabinoids in hemp,
we are expected biologically, biological
[SPEAKER_00]: expectations to get a minimum of 1% THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore setting the federal limit at
0.3% or less really limits the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids that this plant can
theoretically produce overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that regulations versus the
biological expectations of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, don't really match up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So THC interactions, we're looking
specifically at THC and its interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the human receptors, particularly
interacts with the CB1 receptor in the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the majority of these receptors are
found in the nervous system tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when bound by THC, they modulate the
electrochemical systems that allow us to
[SPEAKER_00]: perceive the world, presumably resulting
in that psychoactive effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's just a little comparison here
and some studies have been done on THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Found in that article.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lastly, just want to leave you with a
THC comparison to aspirin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also explains the logistic muscle
relaxant and anti-plasmic properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC has been shown to have 20 times the
anti-inflammatory power of aspirin and
[SPEAKER_00]: twice that of hydrocortisone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're seeing kind of that
potential medical benefits of THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: of other cannabinoids and related to the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully this gave you a little bit
more detail than you may not have
[SPEAKER_00]: originally realized about the cannabinoid
THC and THCA produced by cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
