[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBacco University video,
I'm going to cover flood and drain or some
[SPEAKER_00]: people call it the ebb and flow irrigation
method and relate it to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you call it flood and drain or you
call it ebb and flow, let's get into this
[SPEAKER_00]: method of irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the basics of this general
method of irrigation is that plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: typically grown in an inert substrate that
is within a container located in a growing
[SPEAKER_00]: tray where nutrient containing water is
pumped from the reservoir to the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of see that evident right here in
this very simple homeowners type setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: This essentially will flood the tray,
allowing the substrate and roots to absorb
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the nutrient solution before the
water slowly drains back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: This process also aids in the aeration of
the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another benefit of this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why do growers like this system in
general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's easy to automate and it's also
easy to set up and really requires minimal
[SPEAKER_00]: parts and equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The system is also scalable, meaning it
can be used for if you're only growing one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, if you're growing hundreds,
if you're growing thousands or more than
[SPEAKER_00]: that of plants, it can be applied to that
situation as we see in the images
[SPEAKER_00]: presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's no perfect system,
so there are some drawbacks to this
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage of this system as any
other hydroponic systems in general is
[SPEAKER_00]: that if something goes wrong, even for a
short period of time, the entire crop
[SPEAKER_00]: could be a loss simply because they're all
dependent on that exact same water source.
[SPEAKER_00]: This requires growers to carefully
monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process is essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: This includes nutrient concentrations as
well as pH values.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typical nutrient solutions are changed
every seven to 10 days or so, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: system should be cleaned between grow
cycles or at any point that it's noticing
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's justified or warranted by
looking at the plants, looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: trays, and also the reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what equipment do you need if you're
thinking about employing this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a reservoir ideally with a lid,
a growing tray to support the plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: hold the flooding cycle, tubing with
required fittings to attach everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: a water pump that's sized appropriately
for the size of the tray, a timer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and plants that are potted in a growing
substrate that will allow for absorption
[SPEAKER_00]: of that nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times they're sold as kits,
which is great, and this gives you just
[SPEAKER_00]: one example of a basic kind of components
looking at the flood and drain system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what about the frequency and
duration, some of the specifics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how to best run your setup will
depend on a few factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those factors include the age or
size of your plants, the substrate the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are growing in, and general growing
environment and conditions, temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind the size and age,
the older plants, larger plants are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to typically require more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The substrate the plants are growing in,
how receptive is that substrate to water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it holding water for an extended period
of time, things to be in consideration?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the general growing environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it hot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it humid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you able to monitor those conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're monitoring those and able
to keep those in a good range.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if not, if you have increased amounts
of temperature, your frequency of
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation might be a little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, for a starting point,
frequency should be two irrigation events
[SPEAKER_00]: per day during a light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a duration, a 30 minute flood cycle
would be a good starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this might be a little heavy,
so you can always go a little bit lighter,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's just one way to kind of get a
feel for the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 minutes allows you a good time to check
to make sure everything's working,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can kind of work it back down from
there as you see fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you monitor your plants so that you
dial in the frequency and duration that
[SPEAKER_00]: best matches your conditions.
