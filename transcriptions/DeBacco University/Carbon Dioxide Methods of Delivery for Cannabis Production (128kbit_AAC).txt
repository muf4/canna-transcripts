[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tobacco University video we're
going to cover carbon dioxide methods of
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a couple in this view.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go over some of the advantages and
disadvantages of each and there'll be more
[SPEAKER_00]: details of each of these methods here on
Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let me go over some methods for
carbon dioxide delivery so you can make an
[SPEAKER_00]: informed decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have rain tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages are it can allow for even
distribution across the area and it also
[SPEAKER_00]: makes for an easy point of injection below
the leaf canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically tubing that has small
little pinholes in it at equal intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages of using this
system is that the max tubing length is
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 feet and it should be in a loop so the
total area is limited, particularly for
[SPEAKER_00]: large growing operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should also have a fan to help for the
distribution process because over that
[SPEAKER_00]: long area you don't have any accumulation
or an oscillating fan to help ensure that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting an even mixing of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite it's being distributed pretty over
a large area, you want to make sure you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting mixing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's also passive point injection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the advantage is that this is the
simplest setup in the sense that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: just one little end of a tubing and that's
where your carbon dioxide comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is it may cost high
concentration pockets to develop in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space because you're really only
having the distribution of that carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide at one central point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also have injection point behind a
fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is like the next step above the
last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply put the injection point and put it
right behind a fan to help, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: help that mixing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage is it's really easy to set
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most likely you might have a fan in your
growing space already.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ensures distribution throughout the
grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this may have challenges in
getting an even distribution in an
[SPEAKER_00]: odd-shaped room or one that's particularly
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be good for a very small
potential to grow tent operation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not necessarily for a larger growing
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, we have our heat source as a
point of carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the advantages of using a heat source
is that if you need to heat the space
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway, want to get some added carbon
dioxide to your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantage is if the heater
comes on only at night for the addition of
[SPEAKER_00]: heat, the added carbon dioxide that it
provides your plants will not really
[SPEAKER_00]: provide them any benefit because keep in
mind plants can only utilize carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide during the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the lights are on and the sunlight
is out, that's when they can use carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't utilize it at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using this as a heat source
and it's only coming on at night when the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights are off because you have less heat
in the area, not going to provide you with
[SPEAKER_00]: as much benefits as it potentially could.
