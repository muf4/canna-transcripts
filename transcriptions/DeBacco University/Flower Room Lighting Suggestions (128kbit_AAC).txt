[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at this image here, we can see
this is a flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go over some of the
suggestions for lighting a flower room,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though this one uses a lot of
high-pressure sodium lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the flower room is where the maximum
PAR rating is needed for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it's definitely worth getting
a PAR meter and comparing to make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: are supplying your plants with adequate
amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be under the most stress,
so maximizing cannabinoid production is an
[SPEAKER_00]: important part of the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Setting them up well, while in the
vegetative stage in particular,
[SPEAKER_00]: will make this stage easier, I call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants come in poorly and poor
structure and stress, it's going to make
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower rooms job a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in a lot healthier and well and
robust, then that prepares them well for
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowering stage because this is where
typically the most stress the plants will
[SPEAKER_00]: be under.
[SPEAKER_00]: So high-pressure sodium lights are
considered the current standard light to
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see a lot while they are off in
this image.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how many are hanging above the
plants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The all-in-one ballast, ballast,
reflector, and bulb setup is preferred
[SPEAKER_00]: versus one that is separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that we do have the ballast,
the reflector, and the bulb all in one
[SPEAKER_00]: unit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that the hour of life of the
bulb for high-pressure sodiums is 5,000 to
[SPEAKER_00]: about 8,000 hours maximum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to take into
consideration if you're going through and
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting a flower room with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind the hours you're cheating
those bulbs out before they really wear
[SPEAKER_00]: out and cut down on your overall potential
for harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reflector should also be changed out
about every other year because you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize the amount of light getting to
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be the bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most growers are changing those out about
every year or a little less and changing
[SPEAKER_00]: the reflectors out about every other year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the high-pressure sodium
lights, keep in mind, will produce that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of yellowish, orangish kind of tones
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said they are in this image,
but the lights are off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ceramic metal highlights are
light-emitting plasmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light-emitting plasmas are being
phased out in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ceramic metal highlights, CMHs,
provide spectrum that's not present in the
[SPEAKER_00]: high-pressure sodiums, but there's a lack
in total output.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in some cases, both generally
favoring the ceramic metal highlights are
[SPEAKER_00]: being used in addition to high-pressure
sodium lights to increase the spectrum the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are receiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this image, we can see the vast
majority of the light kind of spill over
[SPEAKER_00]: on the walls here is high-pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CMHs, this is a CMH here, this is a
CMH here, are being used in between the
[SPEAKER_00]: high-pressure sodiums.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're kind of maximizing the
plant spectrum, the spectrum of light that
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants are going to be receiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEPs could also serve this purpose,
but typically due to costs and the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're not really being used as much
anymore, the ceramic metal highlights are
[SPEAKER_00]: being used in for veg, and some growers
are transitioning with the same structures
[SPEAKER_00]: as part of their flower room to help
increase the spectrum those plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we have LEDs and full-spectrum
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these are progressing and will
likely be the preferred light going
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many benefits of the full spectrum in
addition to having low power consumption,
[SPEAKER_00]: low profile, and reduced heat generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, some of these are really cost
prohibitive, so while they may be the best
[SPEAKER_00]: option from the plant's standpoint,
from the growers' standpoint, it might not
[SPEAKER_00]: be cost effective currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for flowering, you don't always have to
be growing under high-pressure sodiums.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some other options, and even
some of those lights that may be used for
[SPEAKER_00]: the vegetative stage can kind of be key
carried over for the flowering to give
[SPEAKER_00]: them that fuller spectrum to hopefully
maximize terpene and cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
