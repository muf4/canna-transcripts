[SPEAKER_00]: Here in this Debaco University video,
I'm going to go over testing cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material from mycotoxins so you can
be a better and informed consumer as to
[SPEAKER_00]: just what these are and why they are of
concern and should be tested for on any
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical report.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over testing cannabis
plant material from mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as always, here's the research
article that the summary will be provided
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn more about some of
the details, you're welcome to take a look
[SPEAKER_00]: at this for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, mycotoxins come from mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are toxic secondary metabolites of
mold that can proliferate in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: environment that is supportive for
cannabis growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycotoxins are known risk within the food
safety industry in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a concern in cannabis plants
because of the suspected carcinogens
[SPEAKER_00]: causing acute and chronic toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, those mycotoxins aren't limited
just to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are products of mold and mold can
grow just about anywhere on walls,
[SPEAKER_00]: on couches, on fabrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, be aware of this is not just a
cannabis problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something in general that's
important for it to be tested in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind that those mycotoxins are
not visible odorless chemical released by
[SPEAKER_00]: mold and spore formations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what makes them such a concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the health threat?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when we talk about mycotoxins,
so they've been linked to kidney and liver
[SPEAKER_00]: damage, reproductive disorders and immune
suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis material can also be contaminated
with mycotoxins during transport storage
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given the known health risks associated
with exposure to these mycotoxins testings
[SPEAKER_00]: is an important safety measure for
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just cannabis, it's been
tested for other crops as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other food related crops is a real major
concern because of the damage it can do to
[SPEAKER_00]: human health in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very important is included with
cannabis testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's also aflatoxins as well as
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, particularly dangerous are the
aflatoxins the type of mycotoxin produced
[SPEAKER_00]: by aspergillus, a flagellus, a fungal
species with, which is a potent
[SPEAKER_00]: carcinogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of an example of how it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see this highly branched
appearance allows these spores to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: break off very easily, get airborne and be
basically transported that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does produce aflatoxins in warm and
humid conditions, typically around that 33
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Celsius, 91.4 degrees Fahrenheit
and 0.99 water activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the ideal conditions,
but it can of course produce these outside
[SPEAKER_00]: of those conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even acute exposure can be life
threatening if the dose of aflatoxin is
[SPEAKER_00]: large enough as the result in aflatoxins
could cause severe liver failure,
[SPEAKER_00]: a major concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different aflatoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So B1 is considered the most toxic,
but B2, G1 and G2 must also be considered
[SPEAKER_00]: as they have result from decaying
vegetation and soils when warm most moist
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are regulations now that set limits
on allowable levels of toxins in foods
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the great concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the World Health Organization,
the WHO, according to the Food Safety
[SPEAKER_00]: Digest from WHO, consumption of food or
product containing more than one milligram
[SPEAKER_00]: per kilogram, basically essentially one
part per million of aflatoxin can be
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to lead to life threatening
aflatoxosis and liver failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one part per million, a very,
very small dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alternately, sustained exposure to lower
doses on the order of 20 to 120 micrograms
[SPEAKER_00]: per kilogram daily for a period of one to
three weeks of aflatoxin B1 specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: can cause acute toxicity and also be
potentially lethal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we can see, the reason why there's
such a great concern, it takes a very low
[SPEAKER_00]: dose to get a potential lethal end result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to screen our cannabis for
mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both recreational and medical cannabis
must now be screened for mycotoxins
[SPEAKER_00]: derived from microbial contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be done in a number of analytical
techniques, but due to the chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: complexities of the sample extracts and
the polar and or liable nature of some
[SPEAKER_00]: mycotoxins, they're good candidates for
LC-MS or LC-MSSSMS, which is looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of liquid chromatography and
microspecs there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, of course, an extreme example
where we're looking at mold developing on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bud here, but realize mycotoxins can
be deadly at a very small level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though the product may look clean,
we want to make sure we're still getting
[SPEAKER_00]: it tested because even something that
looks clean could still contain harmful
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lastly, those safety requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know that cannabis is susceptible
to mycotoxins?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of gives you some
information here.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than 40 years ago, a paper was
published that discussed the unfavorable
[SPEAKER_00]: condition to these and produce aflatoxins
within cannabis, and they can occur also
[SPEAKER_00]: in other plant materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: State testing, though, regulations
typically have a maximum allowable limit
[SPEAKER_00]: of mycotoxin detection on the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there is variation in exactly how
the limit is applied between states,
[SPEAKER_00]: so keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an example, the Illinois Department of
Agriculture requires each of the five main
[SPEAKER_00]: mycotoxins to be separated under the limit
of less than the 20 micrograms per
[SPEAKER_00]: kilogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Nevada and California, the total
sum of detectable aflatoxins, which
[SPEAKER_00]: include B1, B2, G1, G2, combined,
must be under that theoretical limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at the individual
mycotoxins, and we're looking at the sum
[SPEAKER_00]: total.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at your state's regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, New Mexico's Department of
Health enforces one of the tightest
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions of mycotoxin presence,
requiring the collective amounts of all
[SPEAKER_00]: five mycotoxins to some to be less than
the 20 micrograms per kilogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So important to know the regulations,
understand the regulations, and realize
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential severe implications of
presence of mycotoxins as a continued part
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a well-informed and educated
consumer.
Thank you.
