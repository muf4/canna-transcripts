[SPEAKER_00]: This is the DeBacco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go through glandular trichomes viewed with
a scanning electron microscope to really
[SPEAKER_00]: give you a different perspective and a
different look at these structures,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you've probably seen quite a bit
from a macroscopic standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really going to be kind of a
detailed look at these basic structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you tune in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read some of the information
so you can really focus at looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality images provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality images were provided based on
this research article here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to take a look at them or
kind of look at some more of the details
[SPEAKER_00]: of the full study, you're welcome to use
this citation to find this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But great, great images are provided here,
which I encourage to share with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, just the varieties being
grown, Moby Dick and Space Queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there'll be abbreviated MD and SQ
throughout this, just to give you a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of idea of kind of the abbreviations.
[SPEAKER_00]: For these, because there'll be a lot of
text here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, start with a little
macroscopic view, the inflorescence
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison, the morphology of developing
inflorescence in two cannabis genotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: examined here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, here we're looking at Moby Dick at
three weeks of inflorescence development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for B here, we've got Space Queen
also at three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the different morphological
differences here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: For here, we're looking at Moby Dick on
the left and Space Queen on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, at six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the arrows in all of these,
it showed the position of which the BRACs
[SPEAKER_00]: were sampled for microscopic observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these different regions right here and
these different regions right here are the
[SPEAKER_00]: areas we're going to be looking at in a
very zoomed in portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can kind of get appreciation for
where the researchers were looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now again, the comparisons, the morphology
of developing inflorescence in two
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis genotypes was examined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking over here, the stigmas,
which is read by the ST, appear as an
[SPEAKER_00]: orange-brown coloration, the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be seen on the calyx, which is
located right here on inflorescence leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: of the strain for Moby Dick at eight
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at E and F, trichomes
and BRACs, the strain and Space Queen at
[SPEAKER_00]: eight weeks here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The arrows point to the stigmas again that
appear brown and orange as well on that
[SPEAKER_00]: variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: For letter G here, the dried inflorescence
or the bud of Moby Dick after harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds has been trimmed to remove the
inflorescence leaves and the arrows point
[SPEAKER_00]: to the dried stigmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just give me a little bit of
that macroscopic view before we now get
[SPEAKER_00]: into the detailed microscopic view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, to understand the trichomes
we will be looking at, there's the capitae
[SPEAKER_00]: stalked trichomes, capitae sessile,
and the bulbous trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can kind of see here the stalked
sessile and the bulbous trichomes here,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the bulbous being the very,
very small in size comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: The capitae sessile are basically the
stalked without the stalk, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a way to think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's looking straight down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look here, you'd see the little
tiny, tiny ones of the bulbous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sessile are kind of the little bit,
looks like little water droplets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the capitae stalked are the ones here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now description, again, the stalked are
the largest, most abundant, can be seen
[SPEAKER_00]: with the naked eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're a rich source of the CHC and
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sessile ones are smaller than their
stalked trichomes, but still able to be
[SPEAKER_00]: seen and appear when the plants begin to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are less potent, but still produce
significant amounts of cannabinoids as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the little tiny bulbous ones are the
smallest of the three types.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give that glossy kind of sheen to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite their size, they can contribute to
the overnight cannabinoid and terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's get into some of the research
images.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm going to try to provide
some of the narrations here on the left,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can kind of focus on the images and
I'll try to point and highlight different
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all images here are of the lower brach
surface at three and six weeks of
[SPEAKER_00]: inflorescence development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're looking at Moby Dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: A stalked capia trichome in the foreground
here, right where the arrow is pointing,
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the smallest bulbous ones in
the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can definitely see the size
difference here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at B and C here, looking at these
two, the bulbous trichomes formed on short
[SPEAKER_00]: pedicles here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're basically that little short,
supportive structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For D, the non-glandular trichomes,
as we can see with HA, this is the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones that look like points,
little finger points, formed next to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbous, which is the one right here,
and sessile capitate trichome right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, give you that comparison and really
that really zoomed in look that we see
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is noticed here, these little,
looks like little mouths in the background
[SPEAKER_00]: are abundant stomata and they can be seen
in the raised epidermal surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the ones that are going to
open and close and those are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate water for transpiration and
carbon dioxide and oxygen gas exchange in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're looking specifically at
the trichomes, but there are other
[SPEAKER_00]: structures present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-glandular HAIRS, looking at right
here, interspaced with the sessile
[SPEAKER_00]: capitate trichomes on a young brach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see kind of they're intermixed
here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of a cool look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those trichome types, all images of the
lower brach surface, again, six weeks in
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at the magnified view
of the sessile capitate trichome when
[SPEAKER_00]: fully formed, heads surrounded by a
cuticle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like that kind of dome-like
look.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's almost like a water bag
that is filled with a lot of those
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: She hears the precursor of the sessile
capitate trichome, pointed here where the
[SPEAKER_00]: arrow is indicating, immature stalked
capitate trichomes with fully formed heads
[SPEAKER_00]: adjacent to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're seeing kind of point in
time, but the difference in morphological
[SPEAKER_00]: formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here the mature stalked trichomes formed
in large numbers and a great density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note the presence of a small bulbous
trichome right over here on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a non-glandular trichome in the
background as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eyes, the magnified view of the head of
the stalked capitate trichome,
[SPEAKER_00]: fully formed cuticles surrounding the
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're looking at those really,
really zoomed in portions here of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look at that trichome development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me move myself out of the way here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The capitate trichome development,
again, we're looking still at Moby Dick
[SPEAKER_00]: lower brach surface through the six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: At three weeks, most capitate trichomes at
the tip of the brach are sessile,
[SPEAKER_00]: but few, you can see at the arrows,
have started to develop stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early on in development, and we're
seeing some progressing or what they will
[SPEAKER_00]: progress to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-glandular trichome hairs can be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like thorns, but again,
this is a microscopic view here,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they look larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: For image B, the stalked capitate
trichomes forming first along the mid vein
[SPEAKER_00]: of the brach, abundant sessile capitate
trichomes can be seen in the background
[SPEAKER_00]: together with the non-glandular hairs,
kind of mixture here into the stalked
[SPEAKER_00]: ones, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here, looking at C, six weeks,
stalked capitate trichomes can be seen
[SPEAKER_00]: densely packed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is kind of the goal of growers
to have a lot of those very closely packed
[SPEAKER_00]: together, high density, give me a high
amount of cannabinoid and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: D here, the range of stalked lengths can
be seen, so they're not all the same
[SPEAKER_00]: length, with one trichome stalk in which
the head has been detached, which is where
[SPEAKER_00]: we see the arrow here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it should have the little cap on top,
that one does not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, in E, the view of the edge of
the brach at six weeks of inflorescence
[SPEAKER_00]: development showing greater abundance of
the stalked capitate trichomes on the
[SPEAKER_00]: lower compared to the upper brach surface,
trichome stalk lengths are also variable
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and we see more down here on the
lower surface than in that upper portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at space queen, again,
we're looking here at the lower brach
[SPEAKER_00]: surface, again, three to six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: At three weeks, most capitate trichomes
are at the tip of the brach, are sessile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Progressing to B, close-up view showing
the mixture of the sessile and capitate
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes with bulbous trichomes in
non-glandular hairs, those kind of points
[SPEAKER_00]: that we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no stalked capitate trichomes in
this image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: C through E, so this row right here,
the pre-secretory or the sessile trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: showing the outlines of pre-secretory disc
cells, kind of like little mushrooms on
[SPEAKER_00]: there, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Progressing on to F, a range of stalked
lengths have developed in the capitate
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes, and sessile trichomes can be
seen in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a range, when they're growing
through and developed, they don't happen
[SPEAKER_00]: all at the same time, they happen the same
general time, that's why you get that
[SPEAKER_00]: variance there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For G, at week six, stalked capitate
trichomes are densely packed together on
[SPEAKER_00]: the underside of the brach and have formed
long stalks, as we see here, and different
[SPEAKER_00]: than we saw with the previous variety Moby
Dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: In H, the some stalked capitate trichomes
that form at the edge of the brach have
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely long stalks, up to 1,000
micrometers, with the arrows located right
[SPEAKER_00]: here, see the one that's definitely longer
than the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: In I is the magnified view of the capitate
trichomes showing fully formed heads
[SPEAKER_00]: surrounded by the cuticle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, great kind of view here,
makes them look larger than life,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is actually what's going on in
the kind of macroscopic view you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: more used to seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of what does that kind of look
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here we see kind of that macroscopic
view of the brachs of Space Queen and Moby
[SPEAKER_00]: Dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is Space Queen, this one's Moby
Dick, at six weeks of inflorescence
[SPEAKER_00]: development with abundant trichome
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: The arrows indicate in point two the
approximate position where the brachs were
[SPEAKER_00]: sampled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting here to image part C, to quantify
trichome density, the brachs were removed
[SPEAKER_00]: and placed under the dissecting microscope
at 50 times magnification, and the polygon
[SPEAKER_00]: LESO tool was used to trace the outline of
each segment, as you kind of see here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the black outline there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The position of each capitate trichome was
marked using a pen in 5px thickness and
[SPEAKER_00]: then counted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that kind of look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that data come back and say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here we're looking at kind of the
simulation of that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see the distribution of the
capitate trichomes on the brachs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, Space Queen would be A and C,
and Moby Dick would be B and D.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at three weeks of inflorescence,
and this is at six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see the change that occurs,
and the black dots represent where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: located.
[SPEAKER_00]: E looks at the density of those trichomes
on the upper and lower surfaces of the
[SPEAKER_00]: brachs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So A, D would be the adaxial, that would
be the upper surface, and A and B would be
[SPEAKER_00]: the lower surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clear is the lower, the black is the
upper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here at six weeks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Progressing down to F here, we can see the
average trichome density of the upper
[SPEAKER_00]: brach surfaces is a function of the number
of weeks of flowering period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, G is the density of those
capitate trichomes on brachs as a function
[SPEAKER_00]: of position of sampling with the
inflorescence top, middle, and bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: tier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what we are noticing is these
different letters and getting different
[SPEAKER_00]: significance levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see that here with the abdixla,
which is the lower portion, tend to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: greater average trichome density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the average trichome density as
well, looking at those different periods
[SPEAKER_00]: of time, and we could see this again,
there's error bars indicating that there
[SPEAKER_00]: is a general progression, but occurs
slowly over time and kind of peaks around
[SPEAKER_00]: that week six of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly here, looking at the space
queen versus the Moby Dick, the average
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome density overall, the bottom,
the mid, and the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see Moby Dick being much more
consistent, bottom, middle, and top tier,
[SPEAKER_00]: and space queen favoring the bottom and
the mid, and a little bit less on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always good to compare varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're talking about the comparison of
our stock trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, looking at the diameter in A and
the length down here in C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genotypes of Moby Dick and space queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, Moby Dick here in the first column,
space queen in the second one at three and
[SPEAKER_00]: six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the gland head diameter was
significantly greater at six weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to three weeks in both genotypes
and in Moby Dick compared to space queen
[SPEAKER_00]: at six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing a little bit of that
difference in change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the capitate trichomes lengthen the
genotypes at three and six weeks of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering period here, as we can clearly
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stock length, again, this is the gland
diameter, this is the stock length.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can definitely see some differences
there compared to the three weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the six weeks, showing that
overall development.
[SPEAKER_00]: How they actually look, well if we turn
our attention over to here, the
[SPEAKER_00]: development of those stock capitate
trichomes along the mid veins of lower
[SPEAKER_00]: brach surfaces of cannabis genotype Moby
Dick up here, and compared to space queen
[SPEAKER_00]: at six weeks of influence development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there are some different
morphological changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a little harder to see using
the loop, but from a scanning electron
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope makes it very distinctive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see much longer stocks to space
queen compared to Moby Dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we look at that elongation,
again, I know this is pretty detailed,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I appreciate you hanging with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichomes stock elongation of capitate
trichomes of cannabis genotype from Moby
[SPEAKER_00]: Dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early development of stock derising from
the extension of the epidermal cells of
[SPEAKER_00]: the brach tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that here with the arrow
right there is where it's located.
[SPEAKER_00]: Progressing on to image B, a ring of six
raised epidermal cells demarks the early
[SPEAKER_00]: initiation of the stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not quite 100% sure of the exact
formation or the signaling that requires
[SPEAKER_00]: this, but we are able to distinctly see
these morphological changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For C here focusing, of course,
where that arrow is, this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: elongation of the stock occurs by the
expansion and upward growth of the
[SPEAKER_00]: epidermal cells seen here in the
longitudinal section through the stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of the point at where
things are initiating from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at D and E, here and here,
longitude little section view of the fully
[SPEAKER_00]: formed stock and capitate trichomes
showing the involvement of the epidermal
[SPEAKER_00]: and the hypodermal cells of the stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking physically at those
structures there that are developing,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are forming this ultimately larger
macroscopic structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And F lastly looks at the cross section
view of the stock showing the organization
[SPEAKER_00]: of six cells and the interior of the cells
can be seen here with the arrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a unique one, two,
three, four, five, six here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's kind of this unique and
distinctive structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you may not have considered
before, but hopefully develop in greater
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciation for what's occurring in each
of those little trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The attachment of those head regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking here shown for Moby Dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stock cells here and the progression
of the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of that more familiar structure
that we're used to seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: B and C show the attachment of the stocks
to the glandular heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see right here that point where
that kind of cap attaches to that
[SPEAKER_00]: supportive stock shown in two dried
samples, which is why they look like they
[SPEAKER_00]: have a little more texture to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Progressing down here to the bottom row,
D shows the top of the stock showing the
[SPEAKER_00]: region here to which the glandular
trichome would attach to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, of course, it's been removed from
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just kind of pop the top right off,
pop the top of the muffin, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: and look at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: E and F is a view of the underside of the
detached glandular heads showing the
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance of the underlying region.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be attached to the top of the
trichome stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of shows the top portion,
if you kind of flipped it over and looking
[SPEAKER_00]: down at it, to kind of show the texture
and the cellular complexity that's
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring on these structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, resin extrusion here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at the collapse of
the trichome heads shown again for
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype Moby Dick, the extrusion of resin
formation of droplets are shown again by
[SPEAKER_00]: the arrows here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A and B shows the secretion from the
bulbous trichomes, and we're looking at C
[SPEAKER_00]: and E, C through E, I should say,
showing the secretion of the capitate
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little different formation,
but same basic concept and idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having that kind of storage organ
kind of bulb out in a three-dimensional
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: F does show the bulging of the cuticle,
which is showing the arrow due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: resin secretion from inside the head
there, pushing it, again, outward.
[SPEAKER_00]: G through I here shows the secretion of
the resins caused by the cuticle to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop these central depression arrows
where the arrows are showing and the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome head to collapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see, again, showing that region
there at those different views.
[SPEAKER_00]: J through L shows, sorry, the resin
secretion causes trichome heads to stick
[SPEAKER_00]: to one another, and again, by the arrows
here and the scale bars are shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I should have mentioned that
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at these degrees of
magnification, we can see the different
[SPEAKER_00]: scale bars to kind of give you a
proportion there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, when they're getting so dense
here, we're seeing that kind of merger or
[SPEAKER_00]: that connection of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're talking about senescence,
which is kind of the formation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest and kind of the people might say
the dying of or the aging of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of shows that senescence of
those heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fully developed head with intact
cuticle, no secretions or resins or
[SPEAKER_00]: shrinking of the cuticle has occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, arrows showing the points
of ring of secretory disc cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: B is looking at the shrinking of the
cuticle and shriveling of the head that
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred likely due to the resin
secretion.
[SPEAKER_00]: C and D here, the rupture of the cuticle,
where the arrow is indicating here and
[SPEAKER_00]: here, shows the dense glandular appearance
that is the resinous material underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: E through F, the shrinkage and collapse of
the cuticle on the mature glandular heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is caused by the aggregation of
the underlying resinous material in the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface of the heads appearing convoluted
and wrinkled right where those arrows are
[SPEAKER_00]: pointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a close-up of the dried resinous
material right here, kind of really tight
[SPEAKER_00]: zoom in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And H and I showing the dried convoluted
appearance of the glandular heads that are
[SPEAKER_00]: completely basically senescent here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at the very end of the life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look at the progression of trichome
development and the senescence here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see number of weeks in the flowering
period, the trichome stalk development,
[SPEAKER_00]: the heads, the resins, and the head
senescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does that exactly occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are looking at our genotypes
again for Moby Dick and a space queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proportion of the stalk trichome
increases exponentially with time in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering periods, and it maximizes around
eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do see that exponential increase
with that kind of peak occurring right
[SPEAKER_00]: around week eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process of drainular heads and
secretion of resins and senescence begins
[SPEAKER_00]: around week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, here and progresses to week eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like that last kind of
part of that curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: The timeline depicts here will vary by
genotype, so keep that in mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as environmental conditions that
impose stresses on the plant which could
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerate the process of glandular head
senescence and basically degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are hopefully under, quote,
ideal conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now senescent trichome says the occurrence
of a large number of senescent capote
[SPEAKER_00]: glandular heads on eight weeks old bracts
of the genotypes of Moby Dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up here and space queen below.
[SPEAKER_00]: In both samples, those heads did appear to
shriveled and shrunken, indicating a loss
[SPEAKER_00]: of resin had occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that indicated right where the
arrows are located.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do see slightly different structures
there, but we do see that same kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: aging and that senescence of those
trichome heads, which is why as growers
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to pick the peak harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking a little bit more at the
details here is looking at the trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: maturation canvass.
[SPEAKER_00]: As is the changes in translucency and the
changes in the red score in trichome heads
[SPEAKER_00]: for genotype hash plant progressing from
weeks three to week seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing this kind of progression
over time in amount that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can kind of see through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sharp reduction in that translucency
and the raise of the red score can be seen
[SPEAKER_00]: here and that's basically what they used
to indicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bract issues at week eight flowering
period in which the reddish brown stalked
[SPEAKER_00]: glandular heads can be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Via the arrows and that's located right
here, especially in the lower half of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at D, representation of the
proportion of glandular heads that are
[SPEAKER_00]: clear, which are the blue circles,
translucent, which are the white circles
[SPEAKER_00]: and red brown, which are the red circles
using the color space that they utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this really gives you the quick kind of
a picture, but a quick kind of indication
[SPEAKER_00]: of what category those trichomes fall into
regarding to their progression of
[SPEAKER_00]: maturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: E is looking at comparison of the
appearance of the stalked capitate
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome glandular heads under visible
light on the left and under UV light on
[SPEAKER_00]: the right, showing the blue
autofluorescence that's associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: glandular heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a cool image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a close up of the glandular heads
and an enhanced exposure showing
[SPEAKER_00]: autofluorescence under UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subaggregation of glandular heads due to
resin secretion can be seen also right
[SPEAKER_00]: here where the arrow is indicating those
heads are kind of clumping together as we
[SPEAKER_00]: saw earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing I found interesting here,
if you tuned in for this long,
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you, is the post-harvest handling of
our trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the effect of post-harvest handling
practice on capitate trichome integrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the genotype pincush that they
used in this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at letter A up here,
it's a sample that was hand trimmed to
[SPEAKER_00]: remove the inflorescence leaves before
drying, shows the majority of the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hand trimming, being very careful on
hand trimming, varieties here pincush,
[SPEAKER_00]: those trichomes are pretty much intact or
undisturbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at B, a close up view of the
trichomes and hand trimmed samples showing
[SPEAKER_00]: all glandular heads are intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just from that kind of zoomed out
version, even zooming in a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: closer, we can see the lack of damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now C was a sample that was mechanically
trimmed to remove the inflorescent leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: showing the loss of the trichomes in many
heads had become detached.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that with the arrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see basically the stalk here without
that nice little bulb on top, it just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not that big bulb that occurs on
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically they've been removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's through the mechanical trimming
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: D is the close up indicating again,
it was mechanically trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those basically heads are broken off,
especially at the edges of the bracts are
[SPEAKER_00]: the most likely to come in contact with
that machinery.
[SPEAKER_00]: E and F shows the dry stalks after five
days of drying at 50 to 55% relative
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, show the outlines of the
epidermal, hypodermal cells that make up
[SPEAKER_00]: the stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most glandular heads are intact with a few
broken off indicated by the arrows here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it really speaks to taking the
time to, you know, doing a hand trim would
[SPEAKER_00]: be great because you're doing less damage
as long as you're careful with hand
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming than mechanical harvester to
those trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, this shows post-harvest impact on
those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A comparison here under four cannabis
genotypes have undergone post-harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is looking at how that drying
aspect impacts the trichome development.
[SPEAKER_00]: D is recorded from 25 trichomes with three
replicate samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: A is looking at the genotype skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gruntular heads are fully formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichome stalks are short and no resin is
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see that here with the arrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: B is the temple spice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichome stalks are intermediate in length
and heads are releasing resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, right where that arrow is
indicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: A healer for letter C here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichomes are long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most have secreted resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, showing where that arrow is located
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: D is looking at the genotype terrapinade
where the trichome stalks are long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many grams of trichome heads release
resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many heads have also detached.
[SPEAKER_00]: E is the comparison of the trichome
density in the four cannabis genotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: based on data collected from the images.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see the average trichome
density and we could see the variance that
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs with the different genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Standard arrow bars are shown on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: F is looking at the comparison of the
proportion of the stocked versus unstocked
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes in the four genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the different colorations here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stocked representing the gray and the
unstocked representing the black
[SPEAKER_00]: coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, comparison of the portion
of the desiccated and senescent trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: in the four genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just speaks to, again,
showing the knowing your genotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing what variety you're growing,
maybe growing it multiple times to get an
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciation for its characteristics and
making that selection can be very
[SPEAKER_00]: important because as we can see here,
there's a great variability in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once that's necessarily better than
the other, just understanding your own
[SPEAKER_00]: variety, understanding what it produces to
hopefully maximize and optimize your yield
[SPEAKER_00]: and your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you like this kind of in-depth
microscopic look at things and we're able
[SPEAKER_00]: to tune into the end here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a pretty intense look, but
definitely take a look at the research
[SPEAKER_00]: article, some quality images so you can
appreciate those trichomes hopefully on a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole new level.
Thank you.
Thank you.
