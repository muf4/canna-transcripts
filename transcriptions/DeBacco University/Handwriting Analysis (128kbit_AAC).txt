[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you've been taking some notes
and you can kind of apply some of this
[SPEAKER_00]: handwriting analysis to something you
recently have written to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate some of the details within your
handwriting more than you may have
[SPEAKER_00]: realized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with each person has a unique
handwriting style.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever looked at your friends or
anyone else's you probably know this to be
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has a natural variations which
can be due to writing instrument,
[SPEAKER_00]: mood, the age, the time restraints,
audience it's writing for, it might be
[SPEAKER_00]: sloppy, might be messier.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could all play into exactly the style
of the particular handwriting you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So factors that kind of in general that
will influence handwriting might be the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of your fingers, your hands,
your arms, whether they're small or
[SPEAKER_00]: they're large, the muscular makeup that
can be impacted by your sports or work or
[SPEAKER_00]: hobbies that you may have, education,
where'd you learn to write, did you learn
[SPEAKER_00]: certain nuances or details, style and
personality, are you in a rush,
[SPEAKER_00]: are you detail oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all factors that influence
someone's handwriting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we look at an examination of
handwriting, given an adequate amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: handwriting samples, there will not be
identical features.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every person has a range of natural
handwriting variations because no one
[SPEAKER_00]: writes like a machine, it's not the exact
same font so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important to remember when
you're looking at making comparisons that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not looking for an identical,
perfect, perfect, identical match,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for some of these
characteristics and consistencies within
[SPEAKER_00]: these characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one characteristic you're looking for
is letter form.
[SPEAKER_00]: This includes letter shape, curve,
slant, size, continuous stroke,
[SPEAKER_00]: and correct appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically for this you're looking at the
letters G, Y, H and K.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see some examples here of G,
Y, H and K and how they may look with
[SPEAKER_00]: different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the letter form, what's the curve,
what's the slant, how far is it slanted,
[SPEAKER_00]: what letters are slanted, these are just
some definite things to be looking for the
[SPEAKER_00]: general form of the letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have to consider line form,
and this includes the smoothness of the
[SPEAKER_00]: letters and darkness of the lines of
different strokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are they writing?
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be very messy and maybe not be
able to read what name it is, but again
[SPEAKER_00]: these characteristics can be carried
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at line form, if it's written on a
piece of paper that does have lines that
[SPEAKER_00]: can affect certain things, as well as the
darkness of the lines and strokes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: pen pressure that the person may be
utilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the formatting as kind of our last
main at least characteristic to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go to these in more detail in other
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: But formatting includes the spacing
between the letters, the words,
[SPEAKER_00]: the lines, the placement of the words,
and also the margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there gaps between the handwriting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there no gaps between the words?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there gaps?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they kind of following a margin line?
[SPEAKER_00]: All different characteristics when you're
looking at the handwriting sample to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider whether it's a match to something
you're trying to make because they won't
[SPEAKER_00]: be identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of these characteristics match up
and to what degree do they match up will
[SPEAKER_00]: help you analyze someone's handwriting.
