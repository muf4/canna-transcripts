[SPEAKER_00]: So in this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to be covering fabric pots and
[SPEAKER_00]: grow bags for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's start looking at some of
these fabric pots and grow bags for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the advantage of using a
fabric pot is that it allows for aeration
[SPEAKER_00]: to the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in small to potentially very
large sizes up to 400 gallons in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very user friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The material allows for natural root
pruning to avoid kind of that circling
[SPEAKER_00]: effect that you might get with a solid
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they also allow water to drain
very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these are great advantages and part
of the reason why they've become so
[SPEAKER_00]: popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: The material that they're made of might
vary slightly from company to company.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here I provided a little example here
of what's called gorilla pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty commonly used.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are used basically a breathable
fabric that helps support while still
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing movement to the root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're typically made from mostly
polypropylene fiber with an anti-UV
[SPEAKER_00]: application to reduce degradation,
especially in outdoor settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because fabric pots are not only used just
in indoor settings, they can be used also
[SPEAKER_00]: in outdoor settings where there's a lot
more environmental stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure if you are
growing in an outdoor situation that you
[SPEAKER_00]: are finding a pot that may pay a little
extra for, but definitely has the
[SPEAKER_00]: advantages of having this anti-UV
applications made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now fabric pots, you'll notice that they
come in a variety of colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while there are a variety of color
options, tan simply has gained popularity,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in outdoor settings,
because it can keep the roots cool in the
[SPEAKER_00]: heat of summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that's going to not necessarily
absorb a lot of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw the white one earlier, but won't
show the dirt from moving it around quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there's a variety of colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The really advantageous particularly for
the outdoor netland, you want that anti-UV
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilizer, but you want something that's
going to keep that root zone relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now fiber pots and water, we're going
through and kind of like looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: reusing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fiber pots do not really collect water,
so this can help prevent over-watering of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows them to drain through very
easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also many fiber pots are washable and
can be reused.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's another potential advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here we're using a solid container,
and then we're having the fabric pot here
[SPEAKER_00]: with some material at the bottom that will
allow it to drain very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is again a way particularly for
new growers to help prevent them from
[SPEAKER_00]: over-watering their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going through and wanting to
reuse that, make sure you're giving it a
[SPEAKER_00]: good scrub, a good wash, removing as much
of the substrate as possible so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: be reused with reduced chance of
contamination from one crop to the other.
