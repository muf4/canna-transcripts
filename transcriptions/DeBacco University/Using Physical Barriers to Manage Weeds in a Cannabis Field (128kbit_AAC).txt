[SPEAKER_00]: So this Tobacco University video is going
to be looking at some physical barriers
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to weed suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into using physical barriers to
manage weeds in a cannabis field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often this is cost prohibitive on a
large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it does create a great look to the
field, does create a very clean field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does require a lot of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's best suited for smaller and closer in
row spacing fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do you need the material?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also need kind of ways to kind of
hold it down so the wind doesn't blow and
[SPEAKER_00]: carry it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these needs to be tucked in by burying
the edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're seeing a bunch of stone weights
or cinder blocks or pellets.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those need to be established well so
that you're not damaging the plants if the
[SPEAKER_00]: wind was to kind of shift or move that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does, once established,
create a very clean field and really
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminates any chance of weeds popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this clean field that I talked about,
if a physical barrier is used for the
[SPEAKER_00]: planting of rows, it's also the walking
paths can be essentially created to a
[SPEAKER_00]: clean field that will reduce the soil
splash and possibly reduce disease as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it needs to be established.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be held in place very well so
you're not having giant holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're limiting areas where potential
for weeds can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this also reduces any soil splash in
your walking rows as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really helps keep your plants very clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: For high traffic areas, if your field has
a high traffic, using a physical barrier
[SPEAKER_00]: creates a carpet-like effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: To reduce the chance of workers carrying
soil particles from one area to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can help reduce the transfer of
soil-based diseases, which can be of
[SPEAKER_00]: concern, particularly on larger growing
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see typically garden mums are
grown in this way and they're grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this doesn't necessarily mean when
using a physical barrier, the plants have
[SPEAKER_00]: to be physically planted in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be used with container growing as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also makes it really easy to move the
plants throughout and take them and load
[SPEAKER_00]: them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or move them from one field to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, does offer some benefits,
but keep in mind that initial
[SPEAKER_00]: establishment and upfront cost can be
drawbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the timing of the physical barrier
is also very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time of planting, the physical
barrier should be applied at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be a challenge as it's when
typically growers are the most busy and
[SPEAKER_00]: this will help increase the effectiveness
and reduce the frustrations preventing it
[SPEAKER_00]: from shifting during the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times growers want to just plant
all their plants and then go back later
[SPEAKER_00]: and add their physical barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes even the best intentions don't
really get fulfilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're planting a large scale
planting and your initial plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, it can make it very difficult to
go through and kind of re-add that barrier
[SPEAKER_00]: almost as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here when the plants were small,
if everything's tucked in and established,
[SPEAKER_00]: as those plants now grow and get larger,
they're taking full advantage of that use
[SPEAKER_00]: of the physical barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind when looking at your physical
barrier, they can last for different
[SPEAKER_00]: periods of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are more porous than others,
so take this into consideration as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're selecting a physical barrier,
which one is the best fit for your application?
