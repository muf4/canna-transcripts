[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, in this Tabaco University video,
we're going to be tackling the challenging
[SPEAKER_00]: subject of breeding cannabis autoflowers
or root allis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to see some of the complexities
and why it's so difficult, but hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: through this video you'll develop a
greater understanding for the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the advantage of autoflowers
is breeders use these genetics to create
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that grow fast, typically around 70
days from start to finish, without the
[SPEAKER_00]: need to having to change the day length.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simply based on the number of
countless calendar days, so that can be an
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage to many growers, both outdoors
as well as indoors, not having to worry
[SPEAKER_00]: about the photo period their plants are
under.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the trait of autoflowering is
recessive, and it's a simple trait for
[SPEAKER_00]: growers and breeders to observe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow a bunch of plants under a
12-12 hour light cycle, that's 12 hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: light, 12 hours of darkness, and if it
stays vegetative in the early growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that is definitely an autoflower and
not a photo period dependent trait,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as you would have with an indica or a
sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recessive does not mean bad or negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does mean that the plant needs two
copies, one from the material and one from
[SPEAKER_00]: the parental line, in order for the trait
to be expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an important note there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go back to our little planet
squares, for that recessive gene to be
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed, we would need two copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example, yellow would be
recessive, green would be dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see in order to get that yellow
coloration, we need two copies of that
[SPEAKER_00]: recessive allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now back-crossing basics in the breeding
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back-crossing is a crossing of a hybrid
with one of its parents or an individual
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically similar to its parent in order
to achieve offspring with a genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: identity which is closer to that of the
parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back-cross hybrids are sometimes described
with the acronym BC.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, an F1 hybrid crossed with one
of its parents or genetically similar
[SPEAKER_00]: individual can be termed BC1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see that some of the images
here are hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a further cross of the BC1 hybrid to
the same parent or genetically similar
[SPEAKER_00]: individual, again, produces the BC2
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This breeding process is more restricted
to recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that kind of BC1, BC2
terminology here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing a shift in that population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at continued examples
of this back-crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this back-crossing, it follows a shown
pattern of inheritance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that breeding auto flowers is
a true breeding photo dependent variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all looking at the patterns that are
forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that BC1, BC2 formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the offspring will be
heterozygotes, which means they all be
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're taking an auto flower and
breeding with a true breeding photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent, all of the offspring are going
to be photo period dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a dominant trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's important also to note that
all of the offspring will be carriers for
[SPEAKER_00]: the auto flowering trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the F1 gen and we're going to
go through and breed from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is where things initially
might skip that first generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding it again will then start to bring
that trait out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we breed that F1 with that F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: This follows a pattern shown of
inheritance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Offspring of the desired trait will be
needed and selected for.
[SPEAKER_00]: 75% will be photo period dependent since
it's a dominant trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25% will be auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the F2 generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see that here again with the
breeding of the chickens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that original.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that kind of back crossing,
that same parent coming back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see how the percentages are
shifting as we go from our F1 or F2 or F3
[SPEAKER_00]: or F4 generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we're looking here specifically,
we have the examples of mice and the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing can be applied to cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This continued breeding and selecting will
increase the amount of auto flowers within
[SPEAKER_00]: the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, you may also want to watch
for other plant characteristics such as
[SPEAKER_00]: the morphology, the chemical profiles,
as well as many other things to ensure you
[SPEAKER_00]: do not produce an auto flower that does
not offer any other benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be great if you can go through and breed
an auto flower, but if it's got the auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower trait and characteristic,
but nothing else, then it's not really
[SPEAKER_00]: worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often this is done for five to nine
generations because you get a more
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilization in this case of that
recessive or auto flower gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the same thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're breeding some together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get some offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get that transgenic mouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep coming back to this line,
breed those together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discard a certain percentage that don't
have the trait we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then breed those together with the same
original parent and go through so on and
[SPEAKER_00]: so forth for multiple generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that first time we live about
25% auto flowers and 50, then 75,
[SPEAKER_00]: then 87.5, 93.75, 96.8, 98.3, 99 plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of getting that vast and quick
ramp up increase in the amount of auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this can get kind of complicated
and hopefully I'm providing with some
[SPEAKER_00]: information and some graphs that you can
kind of look at and kind of go back and
[SPEAKER_00]: study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many traits are polygenetic, meaning there
are multiple genes involved with the
[SPEAKER_00]: observed phenotype or how that individual
looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the basic roles of dominant
recessive still play a role in the
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of multiple genes will result
in what is observed in the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important again to keep that in
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it may take more than simply
three generations to create that
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilized auto flowering trait,
but the basics still hold true and should
[SPEAKER_00]: provide a good starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of that example I gave with the
mice, we kind of see that example here
[SPEAKER_00]: with the multiple back crosses going 50 to
75 to 87.5 to 93.75.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting kind of this curve here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not quite reaching that 100%,
but you're getting very, very close as
[SPEAKER_00]: that's kind of progressing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The percentage of the original
heterozygosity that is homozygous in all
[SPEAKER_00]: future generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you only did it for kind of that
three generations, you still would have a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of, as I mentioned, five to nine
is typically what's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it potentially longer as long
as you keep in mind and remember to also
[SPEAKER_00]: look at other traits more than just auto
flower to make sure that you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting some sort of strange mutation in
the morphology of the plant or something
[SPEAKER_00]: else that is undesirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're carrying over that auto flowering
trait along with other desirable traits to
[SPEAKER_00]: create a very unique and hopefully sought
after genetic line.
