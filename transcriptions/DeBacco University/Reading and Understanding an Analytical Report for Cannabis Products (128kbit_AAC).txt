[SPEAKER_00]: For any products regarding cannabis that
you're looking at consuming, getting an
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical report is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This video here in Tobacco University,
though, is going to provide you with an
[SPEAKER_00]: organized sequence of steps to go about
how to properly read as well as understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what those reports are actually able to
tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so here we're going to go about
reading and understanding an analytical
[SPEAKER_00]: report for cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does apply to a whole host of cannabis
products, not just dry flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is this certificate of analysis,
typically abbreviated COA?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, COAs are a document generated by a
licensed lab that shows the analytical
[SPEAKER_00]: test results on a cannabis sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are used to confirm the potency as
well as the purity while also ensuring
[SPEAKER_00]: safety for consumption, and that's really
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be aware that some states may have
different testing requirements,
[SPEAKER_00]: different labs may have different layouts,
but for the most part, the generalness of
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'll talk about here will be
applicable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, why is testing just
important, just in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it provides the consumer with a
report that is transparent, unbiased,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ensures a safe product in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people will look at the
certificate of analysis, go right to what
[SPEAKER_00]: the CBD or TT levels are and forget about
the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some just look at the terpenes,
but there's a lot more information than
[SPEAKER_00]: just those that's important to be able to
recognize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, verifying an analytical lab
report.
[SPEAKER_00]: So calling the lab that the product was
tested by and provide them with a
[SPEAKER_00]: certificate ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a client ID, we see names,
we see license numbers, we see that sample
[SPEAKER_00]: ID, all these little numbers and letters
and kind of all are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So providing with that sample ID,
kind of like right here, as shown on this
[SPEAKER_00]: ticket analysis, which they use to verify
the lab report is authentic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then their sample ID and they should
be to tell you, you know, the grower or
[SPEAKER_00]: the client ID or the date that was tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Avoid anything that's listed as what's
called an in-house test, as this has a
[SPEAKER_00]: high potential for bias.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're testing their own product,
companies are more likely to skew the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers in their favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third-party lab reports usually have
special markings on it, which does not
[SPEAKER_00]: allow others to duplicate and often will
have signatures also associated with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So third-party lab testing, well,
what is that kind of referring to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Third-party testing, it means that their
products are tested by labs that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: affiliated with them, hence the term
third-party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because a company mentions that it
doesn't mean you shouldn't look for the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab report to analyze before purchasing
because any product can just be tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making sure it's a third-party test is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole purpose of getting these
products tested, I should say,
[SPEAKER_00]: by third-parties labs is to show that the
consistency of the product contains the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual advertised information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also most of all, the transparency is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since growing hemp and extracting CBD is a
complex process, it's critical to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that the product of a consumer's
purchasing is safe for them to ingest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only possible with the confirmatory
results of a third-party test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's in common testing terminology?
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, different labs might use
different terminology, but you see the
[SPEAKER_00]: word, the letters ND typically refers to
as non-detectable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This non-detectable means that it does not
mean it's not present, but it is not able
[SPEAKER_00]: to be detected with the equipment being
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of below detectable levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it could be zero, but it's below
detectable levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you'll see PPM,
that simply stands for parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: BLQ is below level of quantification.
[SPEAKER_00]: It denotes concentration so small that
they do not meet the qualifying threshold
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabinoid content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's LOQ, which is the limit of
quantification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the smallest concentration
that can be accurately quantified.
[SPEAKER_00]: LOD is the limit of detection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the smallest amount of
cannabinoid or cannabinoids that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: detected by the instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last, we have loss on drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be stated, and that's simply
test for the percentages of water content
[SPEAKER_00]: in the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives you an idea of some of the
terminology you might see on these
[SPEAKER_00]: examples as well as others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into the find the full
analytical report.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is on the consumer's kind of
shoulders there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many companies post the COAs of their
products on their website for all to see,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a product does not have a COA
available, it is advisable for consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: to not buy that product and is effectively
untested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually the full COA will not be on a
product's label, but the potency testing
[SPEAKER_00]: will.
[SPEAKER_00]: To view the full COA, consumers should be
able to find the QR code on the label,
[SPEAKER_00]: which should take them to the company's
website with the full COA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the very least, if this is not
possible, it should be available upon
[SPEAKER_00]: request.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any consumers looking at purchasing
anything cannabis related should be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to request a COA and it should be provided
to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not, simply, I would not advise
buying that particular product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the cannabinoid analysis, again,
some things that you might see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the active ingredients in cannabis
should be clearly labeled as it ensures
[SPEAKER_00]: that growers can verify the quality of
their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cannabinoid analysis, and this is
where a lot of consumers will look,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's great, but just keep in mind,
there is more than just the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis to take into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we're seeing some of those
levels, those abbreviations mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have microbial contaminations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the bacteria, mold,
and or yeast present in the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Predetermined contaminant limits are
established for each expressed in what's
[SPEAKER_00]: called CFU slash G, which stands for
colony forming units per gram,
[SPEAKER_00]: colony forming units per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example limit would be less than
500,000 CFUs per gram, just as our random
[SPEAKER_00]: example there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most test results simply list pass or fail
as a result, meaning were they below or
[SPEAKER_00]: above that threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're above that threshold would be a
failure test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they were below that threshold,
they'd be getting a passing mark there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind that just because the
sample may look clean and looks moldy,
[SPEAKER_00]: just because it looks clean doesn't
necessarily mean it will still pass one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these microbial tests or analyses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's aflatoxins, which are very
concerning.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a type of mycotoxin produced by
certain types of mold and fungi that are
[SPEAKER_00]: very dangerous and are potent carcinogens,
which is why you want to identify to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure that your canvas has no aflatoxins
in it to ensure that it's safe,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least for this particular category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the terpene profile and analysis,
and this is getting a lot of popularity
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes are a set of simple organic
molecules present in living organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the flavors and aromas of the
plants derived from their terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find, icing and thyme and hops and
lemon and citrus fruits, as well as other
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes are not unique to cannabis,
but a lot of times provided in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis analytical report.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants produce terpenes naturally to
attract pollinators, which is why it's
[SPEAKER_00]: found in more than just cannabis,
as well as to repel predators or
[SPEAKER_00]: herbivores as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are other advantages to the
plants producing these.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis, they've been selected for the
potential for different effects or smells
[SPEAKER_00]: or aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also heavy metal testing analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis can be a bioaccumulator of
heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: These include, but not limited to mercury,
arsenic, cadmium and lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any amounts of heavy metals present will
be listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, just like the microbial test,
these will simply result in a pass or a
[SPEAKER_00]: fail here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's below detectable levels,
non-detectable, this status here would be
[SPEAKER_00]: a passing mark for the arsenic,
the cadmium, the mercury and the lead in
[SPEAKER_00]: this example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's also pesticide analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where the challenge with
pesticide residue or analysis in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is the concentration difference between
the pesticide residues and those
[SPEAKER_00]: co-extracted cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're seeing units listed in the PPB.
[SPEAKER_00]: So PPM is parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, there needs to be sufficient
sensitivity for these pesticides to the
[SPEAKER_00]: detection to the PPB or parts per billion
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're going to be present in
really small amounts, here we're still
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing a passing, which is great,
but we have to be mindful that we're using
[SPEAKER_00]: the parts per billion unit when it comes
to pesticide testing and analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, now we see a great extensive
list provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply can't test for every single
pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the common ones are provided
here, but just keep that in mind that no
[SPEAKER_00]: lab is testing for every single possible
pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see a comprehensive list and
of course a passing mark for all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides tested or listed so that
they're all below or non-detectable levels
[SPEAKER_00]: to get a passing mark for the pesticide
test analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
