[SPEAKER_00]: Okay here I'm going to go over different
types of firearm ammunition and while
[SPEAKER_00]: these all may look very different there
are some similarities and some
[SPEAKER_00]: consistencies and I'll go over those
specific terms so you can be able to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever part of the ammunition you're
talking about you can be accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off ammunition can be abbreviated
ammo as a material fired, scattered,
[SPEAKER_00]: dropped, or denoted from any weapon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a bunch of ammunition here as
it is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice that there are some different ones
these ones here with the little red at the
[SPEAKER_00]: very end those are called tracer rounds
I'll go over those in another video.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose of ammunition is to project a
force against a selected target and have
[SPEAKER_00]: an effect usually not always lethal so I
don't think it's always lethal but a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of times in this case with the images
projected here yes you're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: probably being lethal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most iconic example of ammunition is
the firearm cartridge which includes all
[SPEAKER_00]: the components required to deliver the
weapon effectively in a single package.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a bullet we have a shell casing
so these are independent terms and these
[SPEAKER_00]: are different so a lot of times you get
mixed up the ones located here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen these are all bullets these are all
the shell casings so if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: through a crime scene and you find
something like this and people say they
[SPEAKER_00]: found bullets no technically you found
shell casings the bullets would be located
[SPEAKER_00]: here so again just be aware of the terms
that you're using shell casings versus a
[SPEAKER_00]: bullet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the cartridge here in this image
consists of a bullet to be number one then
[SPEAKER_00]: the case just located right here and that
holds all the parts together inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: case would be the propellant which is for
example gunpowder and then we have the rim
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the very end portion here and
that provides the extractor the firearm a
[SPEAKER_00]: place to grip the casing and remove it
once fired and at the very bottom kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: center here underneath here we would have
the primer which ignites the propellant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the bullet specifically is typically
referred to as the end point here so when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at a bullet we're really
looking at kind of that end point the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual bullet portion is limited only to
what we call the projectile so a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: times we call this the bullet that's
inaccurate this is only only bullet
[SPEAKER_00]: remember it's that only limited to that
projectile portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the case so that holds again
all the parts of the cartridge together
[SPEAKER_00]: the cartridge without a projectile is
called a blank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the different types of cartridges
and kind of they're not always all
[SPEAKER_00]: together they're served different purposes
so for example if we have a cartridge here
[SPEAKER_00]: that's completely inert meaning it
contains no active primer and also no
[SPEAKER_00]: propellant that's called a dummy so that
would be something to use just to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: represent the same size but it contains no
primer no propellant it's just a dummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's failed to ignite or shoot off
the projectile is called a dud meaning
[SPEAKER_00]: there's something wrong with all those
components didn't work together it's a dud
[SPEAKER_00]: it didn't fire off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when it ignited but failed to
sufficiently push the projectile out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the barrel is called a squib that could be
for a variety of reasons could be a lack
[SPEAKER_00]: of propellant could be an inaccurate
primer but these are some terms given if
[SPEAKER_00]: at a crime scene you find kind of
something that you know failed to ignite
[SPEAKER_00]: or propulsion of the barrel if you find it
within the barrel that could be called a
[SPEAKER_00]: squib just for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the rims you mentioned that lower
portion down down at the very base that
[SPEAKER_00]: provides the extractor the firearm a place
to grip the casting and remove it from the
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see different rims here with
different calibers but that they all serve
[SPEAKER_00]: the same purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now centerfire and rimfire so these are
two different types we see centerfire here
[SPEAKER_00]: and a rimfire are located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Centerfire cartridge as the name implies
is essentially located primer held within
[SPEAKER_00]: the recess of the case head often have
about 65,000 psi max pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rimfire priming is popular solution
because before centerfire priming was
[SPEAKER_00]: perfected so they only have a maximum
chamber chamber pressure about 40,000 psi.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to be quite as precise
they're a little less powerful a little
[SPEAKER_00]: less punch but to get that centerfire
really a lot of components had to come
[SPEAKER_00]: together so before this was perfected the
rimfire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rimfires are still used today but really
for that accuracy you can see definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: that centerfire has that primer located
right in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: That primer I've been talking about primer
when hit and the firearms hammer the
[SPEAKER_00]: primer will hit that it'll cause it to
rapidly burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That burning gas from the primer will
ignite the propellant so it's kind of that
[SPEAKER_00]: first stage and then the propellant goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an explosion ice propellant
casting a large explosion and that large
[SPEAKER_00]: explosion will ultimately propel the
bullet down the chamber and out the
[SPEAKER_00]: barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That propellant specifically these
propellant gases push the bullet base
[SPEAKER_00]: causing it to move the path of least
resistance which is down the bore of the
[SPEAKER_00]: barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Modern propellants are often smokeless
powders composed of nitrocellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some contain nitrocellulose some contain
nitrochlorine there's a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: different types but those are the two
major ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all fall into the same category of
propelling and that's what's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: going to cause the force to force the
bullet out the bore of the barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have different calibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So caliber is a specific nominal integral
diameter of the gun barrel so the diameter
[SPEAKER_00]: of the barrels when think about caliber we
see a bunch listed or shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the 22.22 caliber all the way up
to the 50 caliber here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example when we say 22 caliber the
firearm has a barrel diameter of roughly
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.22 inches of the bore you can see it's a
much thinner or smaller diameter than the
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 cal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is can be measured in kind of inches
or they can also be measured in
[SPEAKER_00]: millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very common one you may hear is nine
millimeter pistol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a barrel as a barrel of nine
millimeters and I have a couple just shown
[SPEAKER_00]: here for comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then lastly we have the shotgun shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shotgun shell is a self-contained
cartridge often loaded with either
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple metallic shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case they're very small generally
spherical projectiles or a single large
[SPEAKER_00]: slug and that can just depend on one kind
of large slug one solid kind of piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: metal or a bunch of little BBs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shell consists of paper or plastic
tube mounted in the base and primer
[SPEAKER_00]: holding that and the shots typically
contain a small chamber inside the shell
[SPEAKER_00]: casing and we could see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically shotguns are used for example
bird hunting where you want to have kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a little bit of a spread to be able to
hit the bird with some of the pellets or
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be a slug if you're kind of deer
hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're kind of having that target
being very specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just some basics of firearm ammunition.
