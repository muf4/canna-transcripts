[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're just going to take a
brief look at some fertilizer labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that while sometimes they are
labeled fertilizer just here and you
[SPEAKER_00]: realize there's no other information,
you can see the NPK, nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus, potassium listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 0050 indicating 50% is potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip some bags over.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is humic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will give you some other information
such as chemical composition, analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and suggested applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, specifically at fertilizer labels,
they don't really lie to you, but they
[SPEAKER_00]: often don't tell the entire story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to know what they're
actually telling you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to keep in mind that
fertilizers are regulated at the state
[SPEAKER_00]: level and various state labeling laws are
similar, but sometimes not identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just if you're looking at
comparing different fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing across state lines, that can
sometimes present an issue, but not often
[SPEAKER_00]: the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those stated values though, fertilizer
labels state the guaranteed minimum,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means there could be more in there
than what's stated on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's an important note to
remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a guaranteed minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the minimum amount that's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they say 5% nitrogen, it's
guaranteed minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's saying basically there's at least 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, companies do not want to under-quote
by large margin as far as what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it says 5% nitrogen, they're not
going to have potentially 15% nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: because they'd want to usually state that,
but it's a guaranteed minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's an important note to make
as far as when you're looking at comparing
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nutrient forms also that are
listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients are listed as a molecule and not
a single element.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here with ferrous sulfate,
heptahydrate, FESO4, and the seven water
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules, there's 20% iron in here,
20% FE, but again, it's ferrous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's iron sulfate is the main molecule
that's presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is because roots absorb most of
the nutrients as inorganic ions or
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules and not single elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: These roots will always say, oh,
they're uptaking nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, it's not just pure nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case with our iron example,
they're not uptaking just pure iron,
[SPEAKER_00]: pure FE.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking in maybe in this case,
a ferrous sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why they're stated in molecules
and not only pure elemental form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why they're stated in molecules
and not single elements.
So that's why they're stated in molecules
and not single elements.
So that's why they're stated in molecules
and not single elements.
So that's why they're stated in molecules
and not single elements.
So that's why they're stated in molecules
and not single elements.
