[SPEAKER_01]: On this DeBaco University student series
video, we're going to answer if you need a
[SPEAKER_01]: work light, why should it be green?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll bring in some research from
Dr. Bugby on this particular light that
[SPEAKER_01]: gets a lot of attention in growing
operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's start off with that quote from
Dr. Bruce Bugby.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes on to say, quote, do not go out
here running around saying, Dr. Bugby says
[SPEAKER_01]: that green light is not safe at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our eyes are so sensitive to green,
we can see plants with one one hundredth
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount of green light as we can with
blue or red.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is still, if you got to have a light,
it is still the best color of light,
[SPEAKER_01]: end quote.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put the link to the YouTube
video there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep in mind, this is really not from
the plant standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why green is being recommended
is because our eyes are very perceptive to
[SPEAKER_01]: that and we can see plants with a very
small amount of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you need to use a light,
even though not advised, this would be the
[SPEAKER_01]: color of light to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get into the video now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using our fence lights just by
turning them on and off with our timer to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow our clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people opt to using green
lights for when their lights are turned
[SPEAKER_00]: off or set to nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because green's wavelength for its
light is a lot dimmer than many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this allows us as a grower to be able
to observe our plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just saw that green light there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, why we're choosing green was
the least efficiently used color of light
[SPEAKER_01]: in the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we're using green light
because it allows us to see the visual
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum chlorophyll absorbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, keep in mind that this light is a low
PAR light and it's recommended for a work
[SPEAKER_01]: light and used only when needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are in the flowering cycle or photo
period, avoid continuous hours of darkness
[SPEAKER_01]: interruptions, especially during this
particular period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you are using this light,
you want to keep it very minimal and use
[SPEAKER_01]: it only when needed for the shortest
duration of time there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can still throw off your photo
period.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, if you need something to see
something, this would be definitely the
[SPEAKER_01]: wavelength of light that would be chosen
to be best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, is this concept of green light being
reflected?
[SPEAKER_01]: Green light is reflected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some is reflected externally, but some is
also reflected internally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Externally reflected is what plants appear
green because leaves reflect more green
[SPEAKER_01]: light than other visible wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: But typically this is only about five to
10% of green light is actually reflected.
[SPEAKER_01]: This wonderful kind of leaf penetration
kind of side view, if you will,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is produced by Utah State University,
Dr. Bugby's lab, internally reflected also
[SPEAKER_01]: occurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why green light penetrates deepest
into the leaf surface because it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiently absorbed by chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was really efficiently absorbed by
chlorophyll, it'd be all kind of absorbed
[SPEAKER_01]: at the very top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's not, what ends up happening
is it kind of like bounces around the leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it gets in to be penetrated
deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this doesn't mean that chlorophyll is
the only absorbing pigment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's many others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep in mind, there is some reflected.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what gives leaves their green
coloration, but it's not as high as most
[SPEAKER_01]: people think as far as number or volume of
green light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some is penetrating, some is bouncing
around there, still being utilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, as a work light, if you have the
option, green is still be the preferred
[SPEAKER_01]: option, but really hopefully doing all of
your work during the normal lights on
[SPEAKER_01]: period.
So keep that in mind.
Thank you.
