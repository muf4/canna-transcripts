[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at wipe,
transfer, and flow bloodstain pattern
[SPEAKER_00]: interpretation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be able to tell the difference between
these and also what each of these can tell
[SPEAKER_00]: us about what may have occurred at the
crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we have wipe patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: These occur when an object moves through a
wet bloodstain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feathered edges suggest the direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking kind of here at a
wipe pattern, this could be evidence of
[SPEAKER_00]: struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be evidence of a body being
moved.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very important to be able to try
to look at how that object may have moved
[SPEAKER_00]: because we knew that when it moved in this
wipe pattern, the bloodstain was wet at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is very fresh and very recent from
when the blood was actually deposited in
[SPEAKER_00]: this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wipes and swipes pattern may offer some
insight into the events at the scene as
[SPEAKER_00]: they were occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So investigators should be aware that
events during the active scene may disturb
[SPEAKER_00]: previously deposited stains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's trying to get the timing or the
sequence of what may have occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they said these wipe and these swipe
patterns to give us a glimpse at the
[SPEAKER_00]: active crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind they might destroy
previously deposited evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have transfer patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these occur when a wet blade object
contacts a secondary surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very little blood is needed to produce a
stain or to transfer it to the other
[SPEAKER_00]: objects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mirror images of blade objects is what is
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Types of patterns can be created by bloody
footwear, fingerprints, hairs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also fabrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pattern transfer stains are often
overlooked but can provide class or
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the example here, we're looking at a
shoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be able to determine
potentially the type of shoe, the type of
[SPEAKER_00]: tread, the type of size.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can tell us some good information in
addition to it just being a bloody kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be more we can glean from this
and that's why it's important to take
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures, document the size because it may
be used later to kind of connect other
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces of evidence that are found.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the pattern transfer
evaluation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to look for patterns within this
stain itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to compare characteristics with
any item class characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while exact matches are unlikely in
this type because the stain would have to
[SPEAKER_00]: have been created under complex conditions
can provide this class evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to create a range of standards
for comparison as this may be a group of
[SPEAKER_00]: suspect items recovered from the scene and
compare these standards with the stain.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good example of that would be a shoe
print pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might be able to produce some exact
same shoe with maybe some exact tread
[SPEAKER_00]: marks, tread wear I should say,
but the general tread marks might be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, as a form of class evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now transfer from here or hair swipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a zoomed in version here
where we can get a crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we zoom in on the wall here,
we can see this, what the transfer from
[SPEAKER_00]: the hair or the hair swipe blood pattern
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of gives you just that kind of
realistic kind of image on what may have
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, this can be used with other
things we may find throughout the crime
[SPEAKER_00]: scene to be able to tell the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, here we have flow patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is blood flows from the
fundamental laws of physics and gravity
[SPEAKER_00]: and indicate body movement after the onset
of blood flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important because this is often
in a regular pattern or patterns that are
[SPEAKER_00]: different from those to be expected may
indicate that the body was moved or an
[SPEAKER_00]: object was in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can be shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an individual sadly bleeding here
at the head flow pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: We expect it to fall in this general
direction, but we have an object that may
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of collect around there, might flow
around that object that can give us an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of placement of things in the room at
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see kind of the regular kind of
flow pattern expected to gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see it coming in contact with the
surface here and adjusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, all of these things taking into
consideration can help us develop an idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of what may have occurred at the
particular crime scene.
