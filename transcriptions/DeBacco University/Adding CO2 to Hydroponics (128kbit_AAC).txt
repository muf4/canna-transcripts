[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're going to look at some of the
specifics in regards to adding carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide to a hydroponic grow setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, carbon dioxide should not be
added to the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can adjust the pH, which can affect
nutrient availability to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots need to respire, so they need to
actually consume oxygen, and they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: actually give off carbon dioxide
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about carbon dioxide
enrichment for hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not directly relating to the aquatic
or the water nutrient-based environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be added to the growing
environment, as this can be beneficial,
[SPEAKER_00]: not to the water again.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a great control over conditions of
the grower, this is possibly to further
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize plant productivity in addition to
the introduction of carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that our nutrients
are all lined out where they need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're maintaining a good pH temperature
and EC of parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure also our lighting is
maximized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting a good PAR level to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our timers and everything's functioning
properly, both for our hydroponic pumps
[SPEAKER_00]: and also our lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I put a picture here of our
ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for venting the area, we want to make
sure we have a properly matched-sized fan
[SPEAKER_00]: for our grow operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we oversize the fan, we could be
pulling out the carbon dioxide that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be carefully and precisely adding
to our operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in one word, yes, if you're
maximizing other conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that if you're just going
to add CO2 to get bigger yields,
[SPEAKER_00]: that may not be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to make sure your lighting is
maximized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to make sure your nutrients are
all dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else is going well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one way to help increase or lift
the potential maximum yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: A tank system can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are using a generator, they'll
produce heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times with hydroponics,
there's enough other pumps running that
[SPEAKER_00]: may also generate heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generators will also produce other gases
as a byproduct.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, again, can also increase the
moisture, which may be something you do
[SPEAKER_00]: not want to increase anymore in a
hydroponic setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep in mind that carbon dioxide
is worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't add it to the water, and make sure
you're maximizing all your other
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions and your venting system is not
overly sized so you're not pulling out the
[SPEAKER_00]: vital carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use a controller, not a timer,
and you should be able to see some benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: with adding carbon dioxide, allowing your
plants to more efficiently produce sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
