[SPEAKER_00]: For those considering retail sales of
cannabis in Connecticut, this video is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to provide you with some up-to-date
information as of July 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here in this tobacco university
video, I'm going to help provide you with
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the latest information provided by
Connecticut as of July 2021 regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: retail sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, if you want to go through
and find the information for yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the link.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the information presented here is
based on cannabis information provided by
[SPEAKER_00]: the state of Connecticut as of July 1st to
July 8th, 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is only applicable for Connecticut
and is subject to change at any time,
[SPEAKER_00]: so be sure to check your local and current
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is only intended to be used as a
point-in-time general example.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not from Connecticut,
this might give you some ideas of some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the laws and regulations that might be
applied to other states as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, as a retail salesperson,
a lot of retail sales are asking,
[SPEAKER_00]: can I buy or sell products with Delta-8
THC or Delta-10 THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically, this question asked in
Connecticut today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the short answer is just simply no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not sell any product that exceeds
0.3% THC on a dry weight basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These products are considered cannabis and
can be only sold in the adult use market
[SPEAKER_00]: by a licensed retailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sales of cannabis products from a licensed
retailers are not expected to begin in
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecticut until late 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very recently adopting a
recreational program, but here we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the details as far as dates and
times aren't necessarily just because that
[SPEAKER_00]: law was accepted and is now setting into
effect things, but there may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: happening as quickly as some people have
thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your product label states the total THC
or THC content of less than 0.3% on a dry
[SPEAKER_00]: weight basis, your product likely complies
with the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I stress the word likely complies with
the law here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the label does not clearly specify the
total THC content or you are unsure,
[SPEAKER_00]: contact the manufacturer named on the
label to confirm the product has less than
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.3% total THC on a dry weight basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta products with THC content greater
than 0.3% on a dry weight basis will still
[SPEAKER_00]: be available to patients in the medical
marijuana program at their approved
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little important distinction
to make right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: A comment that comes up is when purchasing
new products to sell in my store,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do I determine if they're legal under
the new law?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to check the label or confirm
with the manufacturer that the product
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfies the 0.3% dry weight THC limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the number one there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For any product that does not meet that
0.3% dry weight THC limit, contact the
[SPEAKER_00]: distributor or manufacturer to try and
cancel or return the sale because that
[SPEAKER_00]: would not be legal for you to go through
and sell and distribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I give away my inventory of Delta 8
products if they have no more than 0.3%
[SPEAKER_00]: THC on a dry weight basis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, very simple answer,
no.
[SPEAKER_00]: The definition of sale under the adult use
cannabis control substances law includes
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer without compensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, you can't just give it away and
give it as free.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't count.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is illegal to give away Delta 8
products as they have more than 0.3% THC
[SPEAKER_00]: on a dry weight basis in the state of
Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can I sell products labeled with less
than 0.3% THC without a license?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if your product label states the
total THC or THC content less than that
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.3% on a dry weight basis, your product
likely complies with the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contact the manufacturer and label to
confirm that the THC content is less than
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.3% on a dry weight basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, looking at the label,
contact the manufacturer, all things you
[SPEAKER_00]: should be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, are there packaging or labeling
standards for CBD and legal Delta
[SPEAKER_00]: products?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's focusing here specifically
within the state of Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for products below 0.3% dry weight of
THC limit, all federal and state laws
[SPEAKER_00]: concerning labeling and packaging still
apply to any food, drugs, dietary
[SPEAKER_00]: supplements, such as Connecticut Food,
Drug, and Cosmetics Act states.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested in starting a business or
working in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I participate?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lot of people want to
participate in this new and emerging kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecticut's marijuana market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some good information here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, showing a lot of positive aspects
from revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where a lot of people are
considering getting started in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more information on starting Canada's
business will be coming from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Consumer Protection because
the recreational program is very recently
[SPEAKER_00]: adopted, which will be responsible for
licensing any new businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given the anticipated volume of
applicants, the department will conduct
[SPEAKER_00]: periodic lotteries to determine which
applicants to consider first.
[SPEAKER_00]: These lotters are expected to continue for
at least the first few years of the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get into a little bit more of that
detail here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half the licenses will be reserved for
social equity applicants, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses that are 65% owned and
controlled by individuals who lived for
[SPEAKER_00]: five of the last 10 years or nine of their
first 18 years of life in a
[SPEAKER_00]: disproportionately impacted area and have
an average household income of less than
[SPEAKER_00]: 300% of the state's medium household
income over the last three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of a constituent that was
put in there in the sense that trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow people who may not have had initial
advantage into the market to allow them to
[SPEAKER_00]: have half of the licenses will be reserved
for those particular applicants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may find more information about
licensing costs and lotteries process in
[SPEAKER_00]: other articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll cover some of that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the license fees?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the next obvious question is,
okay, I want to have a license,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the fees?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a fee variability, so be sure to
know what you're getting into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is looking at if you're the
non-social equity fees or the social
[SPEAKER_00]: equity fees.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a cultivator, micro
cultivator, retailer, product
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer, button beverage,
delivery transport product, a packager or
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the lottery cost, the
provisional and then the actual license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here being the most expensive being a
cultivator with non-social equity fees,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be about $75,000 there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The least expensive would be the social
equity fees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a free fee category for a micro
cultivator at only $500.
[SPEAKER_00]: To find out more about these, we want to
research within the laws of Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is just providing you with
that kind of a little bit of an idea,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least how Connecticut's approaching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's this lottery process?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to talk about applicants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, some places actually have gone
through and it's literally a lottery,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then they tumble them around and pull
one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecticut, the Department of Consumer
Protection will announce the total number
[SPEAKER_00]: of applicants to be selected and allocate
50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: of them to the social equity applicant
lottery.
[SPEAKER_00]: An application period for each license
type will be opened for a specific period
[SPEAKER_00]: of time to be determined by the Department
of Consumer Protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: A list of all applicants received for each
lottery will be randomized and sent to a
[SPEAKER_00]: third party lottery processor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third party lottery processor will
randomize the list of applicants and
[SPEAKER_00]: identify applicants selected through the
lottery process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The applicants will be reviewed and if an
applicant is denied the next application
[SPEAKER_00]: in the list, will then be accepted until
the total number of applicants is selected
[SPEAKER_00]: or there are no additional applicants
remaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: These selected applicants will have to
complete provisional application and
[SPEAKER_00]: submit appropriate fees and the
provisional license has a 14 months to
[SPEAKER_00]: obtain a full operational license there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw those previously as our provisional
versus our license here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can I purchase hemp products in a
dispensary facility without the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana card?
[SPEAKER_00]: And very, very clear and I think simple
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is just no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nearly no more to say other than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how will cannabis be taxed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is part of the thing that was
holding it up a little bit from some laws
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but there will be essentially be
three taxes on retail sale of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state's usual 6.35% sales tax,
a 3% sales tax dedicated to the city or
[SPEAKER_00]: town where the sale occurs in a tax based
on THC content that will cost
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately 10 to 15% of the sale price.
[SPEAKER_00]: In total, the tax rate is expected to be
approximately 20% of the retail price of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in line with the tax rates of a
neighboring state, Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lastly, the question is, well,
when will retail sales begin?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we go through this process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sales could begin in late 2022 in
Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, the state needs to form the new
social equity council, which will set
[SPEAKER_00]: guidelines for adhering to social equity
provisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state will also need to hire new
staff, issue new regulations and oversee
[SPEAKER_00]: application and licensing processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For new cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Further, these businesses need to time to
secure funding, physical locations,
[SPEAKER_00]: local zoning approval, and all other
elements needed to start a new business in
[SPEAKER_00]: a highly regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That simply just takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The supply chain must be entirely licensed
before sales can begin, and this includes
[SPEAKER_00]: stores, testing labs, growers,
and there must be enough growing capacity
[SPEAKER_00]: to supply the retail market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The governor, the governor Dan Lamont
pictured here starting the actual bill has
[SPEAKER_00]: directed each state agency to work to
implement the law quickly and in a
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this goes into some of the
details that you might be wondering
[SPEAKER_00]: regarding retail sales of cannabis in
Connecticut, at least current as of July
[SPEAKER_00]: 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
