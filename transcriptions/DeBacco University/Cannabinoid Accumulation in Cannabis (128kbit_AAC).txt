[SPEAKER_00]: In this tobacco University video,
we're going to take a look at trends and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid accumulation in cannabis over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into cannabinoid
accumulation in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're seeing a graph and that's
what we're going to be looking at as part
[SPEAKER_00]: of this presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, as always, try to provide
you with the research article or some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the data was collected from fairly recent
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, welcome to check this out for
yourself to get some more of the study
[SPEAKER_00]: specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did they use when we're
determining these cannabinoid contents?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of times we're looking at
totals, total CBD, THC, CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how are those kind of calculated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's important to know the formula
that's used in the calculation for the
[SPEAKER_00]: total cannabinoid percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we can see CBG, for example,
would be the CBGA percentage times 0.878.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be added to the percent CBG
to get the total CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see the other conversion
factors here for some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this study was looking at growth rate,
dry matter percentage and other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some more formulas provided
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you an idea when you're seeing
the word total versus just CBC,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, how they're calculating those
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now total potential cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at some trends here,
what's great is that they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: sectioned out some different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a time series measurements of
cannabinoid accumulation for chemotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: three plants in 30 hemp cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total potential CBD, THC, and CBC
accumulation as a percent of dry matter
[SPEAKER_00]: based on weekly shoot tip sampling
qualified by HPLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the CBD is located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here is the THC and this is the
graph for CBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: These curve models using third degree
polynomial generalization linear models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we see the cultivars here color
coded provided right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing overall general trends of
an increase in cannabinoids as we look at
[SPEAKER_00]: later weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some stayed flat, some actually decreased
and then increased for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are kind of more linear, some are
more exponential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just important to take that into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see that there's two standouts
here for the CBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if we're looking at isolating a
particular compounds, cultivar selection
[SPEAKER_00]: might be important and looking at the
general trends here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we're looking at the THC,
what does this dotted line represent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well this dotted line is representing the
0.3% which is considered to be the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see here, some stayed definitely
well below that federal limit and many of
[SPEAKER_00]: them did increase right above that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're kind of getting into that,
week will say one and a half to two into
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these cultivars did exceed that
limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to take that into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at the cannabinoid
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of a kind of slide here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to look at the research or
just might want to pause the slide and
[SPEAKER_00]: take a look at it because there's some
great information, but there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: information presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the cannabinoid analysis of the
stripped biomass samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the CBD THC ratio included a
1.013 times CBN percentage as portion of
[SPEAKER_00]: the total THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just take that into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Percentages and ratios are estimated of
mixed linear models with cultivar as a
[SPEAKER_00]: fixed effect and the interaction between
site and block as a random effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just getting into the details of
the actual study, which if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn more about, find that article and go
look at some of the materials and methods
[SPEAKER_00]: and the details that they provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're just looking at like total
cannabinoids or total CBD THC produced by
[SPEAKER_00]: the different cultivars, this is kind of
that great little summary table here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can kind of go through and do a little
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are organized by the total
cannabinoids produced here, which is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a summary of all of the ones provided
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some very high in CBD and some favoring
more of the THC that will be well above
[SPEAKER_00]: that federal limit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just got some great information
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a look at and gives you some kind of
that cultivar or ID to something that you
[SPEAKER_00]: might be considering if you're looking at
cultivars to plant in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another research article here is
looking at the accumulation of bioactive
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see the link right here provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this data showed is kind of a
nice graph presented right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is looking at total cannabinoids
compared to total terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cured trimmed flowers were extracted
for the terpenes and cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: composition by, and this was determined by
a GCFID method of analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The total values for cannabinoids and
terpenes in each sample were plotted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at here,
we do see some variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, we're looking at the total
cannabinoids and dry weight, and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the total terpenes produced,
and there's a general trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher amount of total cannabinoids
produced tended to lead to a greater
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of terpenes produced as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's multiple potential reasons for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be if you're maximizing out the
cannabinoids, you have good growing
[SPEAKER_00]: practices, and that might improve overall
chemicals produced within the plant there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not, you know, as you can see,
there's a little bit of a scatter here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that dot line does definitely show a
trend or correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some were really high in comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just the general trends of
everyone trying to produce more
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids might be some benefits from
the cannabinoid standpoint, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing the amount of terpenes that are
also produced can be advantageous for
[SPEAKER_00]: growers looking at marketing their
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
