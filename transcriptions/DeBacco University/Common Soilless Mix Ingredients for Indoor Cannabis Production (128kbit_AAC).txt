[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've been looking at soilless
mixes, you probably know there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients that can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here on Tobacco University,
I'm going to go over some common soilless
[SPEAKER_00]: mix ingredients for indoor cannabis
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we got a lot of ingredients to
go over, so let's get started here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we're going to start with
peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So peat moss, when we're looking at peat
moss, it's an organic product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is mined from decomposing plants,
most often mosses in boggy areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commonly sourced from Canada for use in
the United States, and this does cause
[SPEAKER_00]: some growers to select not to use this
material despite its benefits because they
[SPEAKER_00]: feel that it could be damaging the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The characteristics of the peat may vary
slightly depending on the species of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that was grown in the area, but overall it
is a very consistent product that you
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase from batch to batch, very
consistent, very easy to spread,
[SPEAKER_00]: as again as it warns here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH sometimes can be on the acidic side
at 3.4 to 4.8, but you can easily mix in a
[SPEAKER_00]: little lime there and balance that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's saccharin moss here,
as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is several species of moss that can
inhibit bogs as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a commonly used material, but does
maintain moisture and aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, you'll see it used for a lot of
flowers, particularly orchids in some
[SPEAKER_00]: cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can be used in seed starting mixes,
because of its antifungal properties,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it does have some benefits,
but typically not used on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your bark products, there's a whole
different range of different tree barks,
[SPEAKER_00]: but basically they're all wood-based
materials that are ground and are
[SPEAKER_00]: partially composted.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a less expensive alternative to
peat moss and does provide more aeration,
[SPEAKER_00]: but keep in mind with that aeration,
it does dry out quicker for your roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can require higher nitrogen fertilizers
for the plants because its breakdown may
[SPEAKER_00]: take in or bind up some of that nitrogen,
making it less available to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a common bedding material for pets
and animals, so it can usually be easily
[SPEAKER_00]: found and found in large quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perlite is white volcanic rock that was
crushed and heated, which results in the
[SPEAKER_00]: material expanding, kind of like puffs up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Added to many soilless mixes to help
improve drainage and increase aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perlite is non-toxic, sterile,
and also odorless.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also different grades or sizes
to fit a variety of needs, so make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you're purchasing the perlite with the
right size.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are coarser, which are basically
bigger particles, and then finer particles
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure you're purchasing the right
size to fit your intended use for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also styrofoam beads, which looks,
on a quick look, very similar to perlite,
[SPEAKER_00]: but is a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an inexpensive substitute to perlite
that has many of the same properties,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as improved drainage as well as
aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, unlike perlite, styrofoam will
compact over time and may float to the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface, reducing its effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after many irrigation events,
you might find those kind of styrofoam
[SPEAKER_00]: beads start to kind of rise to the top
there, so just be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For vermiculite, another commonly used
one, and it is a very light, kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: grayish, puffy substance here that forms
when mica chips are heated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vermiculite contains some potassium,
magnesium, calcium, and even some silicate
[SPEAKER_00]: that will slowly become available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slowly is the key word there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be very quickly
available to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is used, though, to increase moisture
and nutrient retention in mixes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's actually the preferred option
when looking to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like the perlite comes in different
grades, a fine, a medium, and a large
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The large is going to have a little bit
greater on the aeration properties
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the fine, but again,
experiment and see what may fit for your
[SPEAKER_00]: particular operation, depending on what
else you might be mixing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also coarse sand that can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large sand particles, hopefully washed in
an and or horticultural grade,
[SPEAKER_00]: are added to improve drainage and weight
in a potting mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are typically used for succulents,
such as cacti, and not very common with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often, the drainage rate is too fast,
and the sand does tend to add a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: weight to the containers, to the mixes
that you might be growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, sand can damage recirculating
pumps, which could be another reason and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably another common reason why it's
not necessarily used a whole lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: simply because of the damage that can
occur to a different irrigation equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's not used for cannabis
production, as well as some other plant
[SPEAKER_00]: production as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: To improve water retention, if that's your
main goal, there's actually a water
[SPEAKER_00]: retention crystals, and there's small
translucent granules that are non-toxic,
[SPEAKER_00]: non-biodegradable, and pH neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: These polymers can absorb 500 times their
weight in water and are added to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the frequency needed for water.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, keep in mind these crystals do
have a lifespan of typically up to five
[SPEAKER_00]: years, so if you're reusing media,
the water retention properties may change
[SPEAKER_00]: as the polymers degrade over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If adding to an existing potting media,
you should always moisten before using and
[SPEAKER_00]: add in accordance to the manufacturer's
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to over-add these if you're
reusing soil and want to add them to new
[SPEAKER_00]: soilless mix that you might be using.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also limestone.
[SPEAKER_00]: With limestone, we're using this to adjust
the pH to an optimum range.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a source of calcium and
magnesium, though this calcium and
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium while present in the stone
particles here may not necessarily be
[SPEAKER_00]: plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often needed to counteract some of the
peat moss to create a final substrate with
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant-favorable pH to make the nutrients
available to the plant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then lastly, getting to one of the very
common biological additives you might see
[SPEAKER_00]: added to a soilless mix is mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a biological growth enhancer that
increases the yield of flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit, and vegetable plants by extending
the root system to acquire the most
[SPEAKER_00]: available nutrients in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycorrhizae also can improve resistance to
root diseases and stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: How this actually works is that the fungus
develops a symbiotic relationship with the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're showing a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the sense that the tree is capturing
sunlight with photosynthesis, producing
[SPEAKER_00]: sugars and carbohydrates, the plant is
giving those to the fungus, so the fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: has a good food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: In exchange, because this is a symbiotic
relationship, the fungus is able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: water and minerals at a greater rate than
the roots because of its very fine high
[SPEAKER_00]: surface area to volume ratio, so it is
giving water and minerals to the plant so
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant can grow better and the plant in
exchange will give those carbohydrates
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's commonly added to
soilless mixes as well as field-grown
[SPEAKER_00]: operations as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, its effectiveness might be
limited in soils that are already very
[SPEAKER_00]: high in nutrients, simply because the
plant doesn't necessarily have to work
[SPEAKER_00]: that hard to get the nutrients in the
first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as one symbiotic relationship that
does occur in nature, where mycorrhizae
[SPEAKER_00]: and plants can have a symbiotic
relationship.
