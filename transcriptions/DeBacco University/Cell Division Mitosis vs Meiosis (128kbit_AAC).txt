[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, in plants and animals, cells go
through the process of division,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it can be through mitosis or meiosis,
depending on what end product they're
[SPEAKER_00]: producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitosis is gonna produce two identical
copies of the original cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meiosis is gonna produce gametes,
such as pollen or egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, cell division results in increasing
the total number of cells, and I said
[SPEAKER_00]: there's two different end products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gamete or sex cell production is
through meiosis, and identical copies
[SPEAKER_00]: would be through mitosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, meiosis produces four total cells
that are genetically different with the
[SPEAKER_00]: goal to produce new offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are cells that are producing either
pollen or egg cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually two phases of division,
and that's how you go about getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: four total cells in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening is the chromosomes are
spreading out and being pulled to
[SPEAKER_00]: different poles, and then the centromeres
are breaking, causing different copies to
[SPEAKER_00]: be resulting in the end products to
increase genetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, mitosis is a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitosis is cell division resulting in two
identical cells from the original that is
[SPEAKER_00]: a result of typical plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: By and large, mitosis occurs much more
frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the cells multiplies, it's inheriting
the same chromosome and genetic material
[SPEAKER_00]: as the original cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't, that's what we call a
mutation that would occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, there's no differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As mentioned from the original,
that mutation typically ends poorly for
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell, so there's steps and measures in
place to allow cells to divide,
[SPEAKER_00]: but allow them to divide in a way that
helps ensure they have the same genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: material as the original cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meristematic tissue is found at the shoot
tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the growing tip here, and also
just behind the root caps.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a microscopic view of the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: These meristems are a site of high rate of
mitosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think about that logically.
[SPEAKER_00]: The avocole, the very top meristem,
is a site of growth, because that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants can be growing upward,
and the root area is also going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: high rate of cell division, because that's
going to serve as that root growing
[SPEAKER_00]: through the soil to increase the plant's
ability to absorb water and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root cap here is just a protective
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That root pushes through the soil,
so if it comes in contact with rocks or
[SPEAKER_00]: some other debris, it's not damaging this
very sensitive and important area of
[SPEAKER_00]: mitosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cell elongation occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is looking at the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just talked about the apical meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant growth is not as a result of cell
division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, the root's growing by the same
number of cells, simply stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows the plant to grow in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: As root cells elongates, the pressure
pushes the root through the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in the apical meristem is where you're
getting more cells, and then they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: elongate in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, cell differentiation, this allows
cells to take on a very specific function
[SPEAKER_00]: depending where they're located in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as you originated from one cell,
and cells in different areas took on parts
[SPEAKER_00]: of the circulatory system or nervous
system, the same thing happens in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, cells in leaves may take on
the function of producing food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cells in the stems may take on vascular
tissue, and cells in the roots may take on
[SPEAKER_00]: the very important task of water and
nutrient absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This differentiation occurs after
division.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows those cells to become
specialized to perform a function.
