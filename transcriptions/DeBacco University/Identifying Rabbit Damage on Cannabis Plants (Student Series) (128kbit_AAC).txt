[SPEAKER_01]: When trying to grow any plant material,
there's always pests to consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this DeBaco University Student Series
video, we're going to look at identifying
[SPEAKER_01]: rabbit damage on cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to see kind of the damage
that they can do, as well as the end,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to suggest on how to properly
install a fence to reduce the chance of
[SPEAKER_01]: this problem happening to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this plant has just suffered some
physical, not biological damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could tell this because the rest of
the plant doesn't really seem to have this
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just localized right here towards the
bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also doesn't really affect how each of
the leaves come out, how their color is
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually physical damage that
comes from being gnawed by a bunny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you usually wouldn't think that
bunnies would be an issue when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: growing cannabis, but as you can see here,
one decided to come up to this plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: gnaw just the outside, causing this
physical damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is localized to the bottom of the
plant because of their size and height
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much, but they do come and will eat
your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you have proper fencing up,
you have animal issues to worry about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this shows the proper way to install
the fence to prevent the rabbits from
[SPEAKER_01]: simply digging underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
