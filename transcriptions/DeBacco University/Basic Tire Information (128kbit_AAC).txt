[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to go over some basic tire
information that may involve some things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've seen but maybe not have
appreciated what is actually there on a
[SPEAKER_00]: tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the components of a tire,
well a tire composed of linear,
[SPEAKER_00]: sidewall rubber, beads, belts,
and tread rubber, and there's several
[SPEAKER_00]: layers composed of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this helps give them their strength,
helps give them their shape, and helps
[SPEAKER_00]: allow them to stay flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there's a lot of different
components, a lot of different kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: layers, but we're mainly looking at
sidewall rubber beads and belts,
[SPEAKER_00]: tread rubber being the main components
there, but some may even include some
[SPEAKER_00]: steel belts to help give them rigidity and
strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the tread elements, so if we're
looking at the exterior of the tire,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's grooves which go around the tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have slots which are transverse to the
tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a swipe which are the small little
grooves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look here, they're located right
here to be considered these swipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have something called a tread
wear indicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are raised bar that indicate the
tread wear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're located not mainly in all
components of the tire, but if you rotate
[SPEAKER_00]: it through and look closely, you will find
some tread wear indicators on tires on
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe even your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these impressions and tracks,
well we have the tire impressions that are
[SPEAKER_00]: the tread design and dimensions of the
tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the tread tracks which are related
to the dimensions of, related to the
[SPEAKER_00]: wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to take these into
consideration as well as with some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: exterior components when you're trying to
identify a particular tire or make a
[SPEAKER_00]: match.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you may not have realized is
that there's something called a noise
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment to tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tires don't have the exact same pattern
that repeats equally throughout the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: circumference of the tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: By mixing the design elements,
manufacturers can impact the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: noise a tire may generate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If tire designs were exactly repeated
around the tire, unwanted noise would
[SPEAKER_00]: occur, kind of create a wall while
especially going down the highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alternating small, medium, large lengths
create different pitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this helps reduce the overall noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that indicated here where we
have these kind of different kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: elements at different lengths inserted
around the tire tread to help reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: noise it's given.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are those things called?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned tread wear indicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at this tire, you may not
see them initially, but I highlighted them
[SPEAKER_00]: here, little arrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are located on the tire and they're
little wear bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're basically a rubber bar that's
raised about 1 16th above the base of the
green bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the tread wears down, these will become
noticeable and offer an indication for
[SPEAKER_00]: replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have when we're looking at tires,
we're looking at something called original
[SPEAKER_00]: and replacement tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can get into when we're trying to
identify or match a car to a crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Original equipment, OE tires, they're sold
on new cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thousands of car have the same brand and
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have something called replacement
tires and they're purchased to replace old
[SPEAKER_00]: worn tires, typically different than the
original equipment tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a whole bunch of different
tires that you can select from if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at replacing tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, we have retread tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sadly, probably familiar with seeing
this on the highway where the retreads
[SPEAKER_00]: will break off, but retread tires are
primarily used for commercial or fleet
[SPEAKER_00]: vehicles in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two types of retread processes,
there's a mold cure process, and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-cured process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some retread tires have valuable
individual characteristics, which provide
[SPEAKER_00]: information to the examiner.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they basically are is it says the
name implies they're a new tread that has
[SPEAKER_00]: been put on an existing or older tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, because of this process,
they could break down, such with the heat
[SPEAKER_00]: of being on the highway and end up as a
hazard along the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be mindful that these retread tires have
new tread, but are on older or potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: original tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and we'll see you
next time.
