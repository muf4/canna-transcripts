[SPEAKER_00]: Okay here we're going to look at cellular
nuclear components and we see a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: cells here with well-defined nuclei and
others that have just their chromosomes
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're going through the process
of cell division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well here we're going to kind of focus on
that well-defined nucleus to start with
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is the command center of the
cell and it's separated from the cytoplasm
[SPEAKER_00]: by a nuclear envelope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It consists of a double layer membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nuclear pores permit the exchange between
the nucleoplasm which is the interior and
[SPEAKER_00]: the cytoplasm which is located on the
exterior of the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this nucleus contains semi-fluid
nucleoplasms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just said that interior space and
chromatin consists of DNA of genes and
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: This condenses to form chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important as cells going through
the process of division.
[SPEAKER_00]: These chromosomes are formed during that
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our DNA are kind of isolated
kind of patches and particles that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be condensed because every human
cell has about six feet of DNA in every
[SPEAKER_00]: cell and it's ultimately going to be kind
of condensed down to these chromosomes
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can recognize as this densely
packed DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nucleus itself has a nuclear envelope
and that's that lipid bilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two layers here and it's a membrane
surrounding the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has an inner membrane coated with
laminate which is a fibrous protein that
[SPEAKER_00]: helps keep everything organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the chromatin is physically
attached to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have the outer membrane which is
kind of ties in with the endoplasmic
[SPEAKER_00]: reticulum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have very important nuclear pores which
regulate the transport of proteins and RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: in and out of the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pores not holes because they are a
regulated step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the reason why these cells or nucleus
have these pores which are very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're large protein complexes and they
do allow for necessary proteins to enter
[SPEAKER_00]: the nucleus from the cytoplasm because
they have special sequences that indicate
[SPEAKER_00]: that they belong in the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of viruses and other things that
want to take over the cell want to enter
[SPEAKER_00]: or find a way to get into the nucleus so
these pores are kind of that regulation
[SPEAKER_00]: step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now small molecules such as ions freely
pass and diffuse into and out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleus but those larger ones have to go
through the pores and those are regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a nucleus we have a small darkened
region here the nucleolus and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: composed mainly of rRNA which is ribosomal
RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's at least one sometimes many can be
seen depending what cell you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the site of transcription the site
of rRNA where those ribosomes are
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesized and processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at a kind of cartoon image here we
have that nucleolus it can close some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the chromatin and ribosomal subunits
region of intensive ribosomal or rRNA
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesis that's that darkened region.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that nuclear envelope that's the
surface of the nucleus bounded by two
[SPEAKER_00]: phospholipid bilayers it's a double
membrane with pores and that nucleoplasm
[SPEAKER_00]: which is that inside that semi-fluid
medium inside the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those chromosomes the DNA of eukaryotes is
divided into linear chromosomes and they
[SPEAKER_00]: exist as strands of chromatin except
during cell division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Histones these little blue spheres here
are associated with packaging proteins and
[SPEAKER_00]: they help the DNA wrap around them so they
can help increase the density and compact
[SPEAKER_00]: to that DNA without it getting tangled.
