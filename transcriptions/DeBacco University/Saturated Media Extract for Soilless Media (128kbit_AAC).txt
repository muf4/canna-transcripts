[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to be looking at
the saturated media extract for soilless
[SPEAKER_00]: media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be wondering what this exactly is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you can kind of think about this
is it's kind of like a soil test for your
[SPEAKER_00]: soilless media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be taking your soilless
media and sending it to the lab and
[SPEAKER_00]: calling it soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not going to get really that
accurate or representative results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your soilless media, because it contains
no soil, needs to be treated differently
[SPEAKER_00]: and the saturated media extract or SME is
the way to go to get accurate results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've included a couple of links down here
if you want some more information,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as from UConn Soil Testing Lab and
also UMass, again about this SME for
[SPEAKER_00]: soilless media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this SME is considered to be the
standard for testing soilless media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a picture of the pellets here,
kind of that standard, that gold standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the one that is highly regarded in
the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this soilless media, we want to be
running through SME.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to be sending this in as a
soil sample again, because it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: use different extraction fluids and not
give us the accurate results that we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's sample instructions, so a little
different than that soil test if you watch
[SPEAKER_00]: that lecture there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to provide a representative sample
and adequate sample size for the lab for
[SPEAKER_00]: the SME.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's sample directions and dependent
fertilizer regimen and method of
[SPEAKER_00]: production will influence what you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pictures of the Legos here,
you don't want to send a bunch of random
[SPEAKER_00]: blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have something that could mask
together and tell a good story.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, produce this Lego figure of
Yoda to tell a story of what your grow is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're kind of haphazardly going
through and sampling and not really
[SPEAKER_00]: following the rules, well, it's just like
sending a bunch of blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get some results back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that really going to help you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You send a quality sample and you can
paint a better picture of what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key is to be consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers need to be consistent with
their sampling and also consider the
[SPEAKER_00]: following questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If comparing results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take an example of a sample
early in the grow and then later,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to be able to compare those
results accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to consider the age or the stage
of development of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the growing medium you're using?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the fertilizer program?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there so release fertilizer mixing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a plant problem going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these factor into trying to be
consistent at the sample you give the lab
[SPEAKER_00]: and also allowing comparisons to be able
to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at the same grow cycle,
and also to consider these if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing different grow cycles or
different plants on different age groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the SME procedure, what they do in
the lab, they don't want things like a
[SPEAKER_00]: mystical procedure here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They simply make a toothpaste here with
soil and water and they take the liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: portion, which is the extract,
and separate it from the solid portion for
[SPEAKER_00]: pH, soluble salts, and nutrient analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the procedure can be very similar to a
soil test, but exactly the details of how
[SPEAKER_00]: they go about this is slightly different
and therefore you should be targeting the
[SPEAKER_00]: test in the lab that matches the type of
sample that you're sending them so you get
[SPEAKER_00]: representative results back so that you're
able to make informed decisions.
Thank you.
