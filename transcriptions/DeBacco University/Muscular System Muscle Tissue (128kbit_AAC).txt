[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to provide a brief
overview of the muscular system,
[SPEAKER_00]: paying particular attention to the
different types of muscle tissue and also
[SPEAKER_00]: the sliding filament theory in a general
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, muscle tissue lets the body
move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, distinguishing characteristics of
muscle cells is the abundance of
[SPEAKER_00]: contractile protein fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are called microfilaments and are
made up of actin and myosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a muscle contracts, and we pull in
our muscles, what's happening is that
[SPEAKER_00]: actin and myosin are sliding past one
another, and this is that part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sliding filament theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three different kinds of muscle
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's skeletal, smooth, and cardiac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skeletal is what we call striated,
tubular, multi-nucleated fibers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're typically attached to the
skeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examples would be the bicep, and they are
voluntary muscles, meaning we have control
[SPEAKER_00]: over them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can choose when to move them,
and those are our skeletal muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smooth muscle is spindle-shaped,
non-striated, unicellular fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each fiber contains only one cell and one
nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's found in the walls of internal organs
such as your intestines, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: involuntary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this moves on its own without
conscious control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last part here is cardiac, and it's
striated, branched, uni-nucleated fibers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and found in the walls of the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And involuntary, cardiac meaning of heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a zoomed-in view of how each of
them look.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what they would look like,
a skeletal muscle on a microscope slide,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this kind of gives you a cartoon kind
of rendition of how that looks,
[SPEAKER_00]: highlighting some of the certain features.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's smooth muscle, here's a zoomed-in
version of that, and then cardiac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to distinguish the
characteristics of all three and also
[SPEAKER_00]: visually identify them would be advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm going to go over a little of the
detail of each of them, and I have a video
[SPEAKER_00]: that goes into each and even more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, skeletal muscle,
the quick summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're long, tubular cells with
striations.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are these kind of lines here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number three here corresponds with their
multiple nuclei, meaning there's multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: nuclei per cell here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nuclei are embedded in the cell
membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice where they're located, and this is
so they're just inside the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This type of tissue occurs in the muscles
that are attached to the skeleton,
[SPEAKER_00]: and skeletal muscles function in voluntary
movements of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, skeletal muscles are attached
to our skeleton, and they're ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're choosing to control here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another type is smooth muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're spindle-shaped, so we notice a
definite shape change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each cell has a single nucleus in it,
and there are no striations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So see how they appear to be smooth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those striations, those lines we saw in
the skeletal muscle are not present here
[SPEAKER_00]: in the smooth muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smooth muscle acts involuntarily and
functions in the movement of substances in
[SPEAKER_00]: the lumens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are primarily found in blood vessels,
walls, and walls of the digestive tract,
[SPEAKER_00]: areas that we don't consciously think
about moving, but they move on their own,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they contract on their own in an
involuntary basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cardiac muscle, these branch off from each
other rather than remaining along each
[SPEAKER_00]: like the other cells in the skeletal and
smooth muscle tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have striations, which we see here as
we also saw in the skeletal muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are junctions between adjacent
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This area is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each cell has a single nucleus,
another characteristic of cardiac muscle
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Striations, single nucleus, and these
connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: This type of tissue occurs in the walls of
the heart, and the primary function is for
[SPEAKER_00]: pumping blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also an involuntary action.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't think about our heart beating,
we just can kind of feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sliding filament model of
contraction, again, I have another video
[SPEAKER_00]: that's goes into this in more detail,
but this is the basic overview here.
[SPEAKER_00]: During contractions, myosin ratchets along
aptin filaments compressing the I and H
[SPEAKER_00]: bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all these bands and these lines
and these thick and thin filaments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, kind of what you want to think about
is what's happening is we have our
[SPEAKER_00]: filaments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, neither of them are thick or thin
filaments or actin or myosin are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening is they're sliding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we have a contraction,
we're having these sliding, these Z lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think of my areas here being Z
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being pulled closer to one
another, and that's what's happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: During stretching, this tension is
released and the I and H bands expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here our relaxed phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our muscle in the most relaxed phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think about it like this,
where it's very far, it's very spaced out
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in our contracted phase, what happens
is they slide past one another and they
[SPEAKER_00]: pull close closer, and that's our
contracted phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The A band remains constant throughout the
length of the myosin filaments and does
[SPEAKER_00]: not change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you notice, we compare our relaxed
and our contracted model, we notice that
[SPEAKER_00]: the length of the actin didn't change,
the length of the myosin didn't change,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the space between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our H band here shrunk considerably,
and that is because we have those things
[SPEAKER_00]: sliding together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our thick filaments and our
thin filaments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the thick filaments correspond with
myosin, and our thin filaments correspond
[SPEAKER_00]: with actin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how it would look in the real
world here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of gives you a little bit better
of a picture of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This H zone here is just being reduced and
compressed when we have these two
[SPEAKER_00]: filaments sliding against one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this is helpful and we view it a
little bit for this sliding filament model
[SPEAKER_00]: of contraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a basic overview of the muscular
tissue types.
Thank you.
