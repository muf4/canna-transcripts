[SPEAKER_00]: So for indoor cannabis production,
ventilation is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here on Tobacco University,
we're going to break down and go over some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the details of ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into ventilation's importance in
an indoor cannabis grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, we need to consider both
the intake and the exhaust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So outline how air will enter and also
exit the growing environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to think of the entire path
of air so that the two systems are not
[SPEAKER_00]: competing with one another, but instead
working together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want one that's bringing air
outlet at greater rate, one that's
[SPEAKER_00]: exhausting, different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that these are
working in unison so you're not having
[SPEAKER_00]: competing systems to allow for efficiency
of your airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Groveworm's intake filters,
the goal is to bring outside air in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're having that intake area,
we're having that outside air,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're bringing it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be passive, but a pre-filter is
advised to ensure the prevent of potential
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminants from entering the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like the first line of
defense there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the amount of intake,
the type of intake filter can vary,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just having something doesn't allow
this air to passively come in,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though that is technically an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: These intake filter options need to be
specific, HEPA filters, carbon filters,
[SPEAKER_00]: or just simply a physical screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This works for large items such as bugs or
dust, but the HEPA and carbon filter are
[SPEAKER_00]: more kind of to purify the air,
not only to remove the larger
[SPEAKER_00]: particulates, but also some of those more
finer ones as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those HEPA filters is just an example of
one here called the dust shroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The HEPA filters can help remove dust,
smoke, mold, bacteria, pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: other harmful, volatile kind of components
from the intake air.
[SPEAKER_00]: The HEPA filters are made from tightly
woven synthetic fibers that are also
[SPEAKER_00]: washable to increase the total usage life,
and that's a great advantage to these.
[SPEAKER_00]: HEPA filters can block out most airborne
particles down to 0.3 microns in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very small particle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the intake, if you're looking at
intake carbon filters, carbon or charcoal
[SPEAKER_00]: filters can reduce odors while still
maintaining a high flow-through rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes them commonly seen with exhaust
fans in sealed rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you could use these for intake
because they're really meant to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: remove odors, not really the best for the
intake, more suited for the exhaust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to simply just a physical
screen, a physical barrier there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the simplest, the least
expensive options.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are going with the passive
system, you should at least have a
[SPEAKER_00]: physical screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're made from mesh, a bug screen
that's based on the size of the mesh will
[SPEAKER_00]: catch insects of various sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind, what insects are you
trying to exclude?
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, for finest size screens,
it's also possible to filter out molds and
[SPEAKER_00]: mildews, but that's a very, very fine
mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to keep air-cooled reflectors
and fans clean from particulate to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent the need to go through and clean
them nearly as often.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either sometimes they just change out
a filter or clean the filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are typically made from washable
materials with adjustable openings to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure an easy fit for a variety of
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the exhaust filters in our
grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these ideally clean air is assumed to
be in the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to the exhaust filters,
the only item that typically needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: removed is odors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why HEPA and physical screen
filters are only used at the intake of a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space, not in the exhaust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's being mindful of where you're
going to place what filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: For exhaust filters, the carbon to
charcoal filters are usually the standard
[SPEAKER_00]: choice as we see here, pulling air through
and then going to be exhausted out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's some exhaust filter options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty much your carbon exhaust filters
or inline carbon filters would be advised
[SPEAKER_00]: to be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this particular situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the carbon exhaust filters,
you see one example right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Activated carbon filters often an
efficient way to capture most of those
[SPEAKER_00]: volatile carbons compounds within that
fine carbon particulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those fine carbon can due to their
high surface area can also filter out
[SPEAKER_00]: gases and odors from the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be used with a fan as part of
the ventilation system for maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning you do not want to just simply
have them passively exhaust and air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carbon itself absorbs the air
contaminants due to the fine pore
[SPEAKER_00]: structure that allows for efficient
capture of materials while still
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining good airflow as important to
the area, the growing area for the cooling
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you're kind of getting the best
of both right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our inline carbon filters operate with
basically the same material, but inline
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon filters make it easy for
installation in typical ducting cooling
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They offer the same benefits of the common
end or start ventilation systems as we saw
[SPEAKER_00]: in our last picture two slides ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're commonly used in grow tents,
air cooled lighting, areas where air is
[SPEAKER_00]: being transferred through ducting from one
area to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, just keep in mind their
efficiency tends to be a little bit less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have to have a little bit
larger fan or a little bit higher movement
[SPEAKER_00]: of air to make these work effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also do not want to forget in
general about the ducting itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's also ducting and there's also
pre-filters a very important component to
[SPEAKER_00]: a ventilation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the air ducting options, we have
non-insulated, which is the most commonly
[SPEAKER_00]: used as we see down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also insulated ducting
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are typically used when trying to
reduce temperature changes from air
[SPEAKER_00]: transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if intake air has been cooled
before entering the grow space,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're to keep it cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both serve the same purpose of
transporting air from one area to another
[SPEAKER_00]: in a controlled pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one's that better than the other,
but if you're looking at having that
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in temperature, you might want
to go with that insulated ducting option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also lastly here,
pre-filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pre-filters are a great cheap and easy
way to extend the life of other more
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive and harder to find replacement
filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're most commonly used with carbon
filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the point that they usually come with
the carbon filter you might be purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-filters act as a physical barrier to
particles before they have a chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: reach the main filter with the goal to
extend the life of the main filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what's great about that is they're
easily removed, can be washed and then
[SPEAKER_00]: reinstalled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always a good idea to have an extra one on
hand, but a lot of times it's not needed
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can just go through and wash
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, their goal is to catch those
big particulates to extend the life of
[SPEAKER_00]: that finer mesh, in this case of your
carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this helps you understand
your ventilation system and ensure that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're operating it at the maximum
efficiency.
