[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to cover standard nutrient soil
[SPEAKER_00]: test analysis, give you some idea what
that will actually show you so you can be
[SPEAKER_00]: better informed and reason why you should
be taking this soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over standard nutrient
soil test analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start off with why we do soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in short, it's to know the nutrient
levels to ensure optimum plant conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: can be met.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to fertilizers, knowing the
soil's pH can also help determine nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: availability and if lime or sulfur
applications are needed to balance out
[SPEAKER_00]: that pH to make those nutrients available
to the crop you're choosing to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what can the test determine?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs might have slight variations,
but for the most part, they tell you pH
[SPEAKER_00]: and they also give you plant available
phosphorus, potassium, calcium,
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium, micronutrients, lead,
as well as aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: All important things to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some may go a little bit more and give you
a bit more, but at least they should give
[SPEAKER_00]: you these and these can give you a great
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micronutrients might vary from lab to lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is pH so important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, pH is so important because if you
look at this image here, it has a great
[SPEAKER_00]: graphical representation of how soil pH
affects availability of plant nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning, if we're looking here at a pH of
seven, we can see that those in green are
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest available around that particular
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in comparison, we can see that
nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium,
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfur, calcium, magnesium, relatively
plant available at a pH of seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to iron, which is more available
to plants at more of an acidic pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molybdenum, just the opposite,
more available to plants at more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: basic pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on what type of crop you're
growing, knowing the target pH level can
[SPEAKER_00]: affect potentially what nutrients it may
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an example, blueberries tend to like a
more acidic environment and they tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: like a little bit more of those kind of
iron as an example, more of the nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: available at these lower levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, great comparison here and you
could see how you get slightly off and how
[SPEAKER_00]: it can really affect the availability of
certain nutrients to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why pH is very important and
very important to know and make
[SPEAKER_00]: modifications for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember, soil test provides the plant
available nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil test does not provide the total
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, is an estimation of the plant
available nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a plant cannot use the nutrient,
then they're not included in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis, at least theoretically.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why if people take the same soil
sample and they like divide it up into two
[SPEAKER_00]: subsamples and they send it off to
different labs, they're gonna put one lab
[SPEAKER_00]: against another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who gives them the most accurate results?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get the results back and they're
slightly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is because each lab is doing
the best it can to estimate the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil test is not the same as a soil
diagnostic test that tests for disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil tests can also not determine drainage
issues environmental stresses,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as insect problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're great at telling you what
nutrients might be available to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, but that's their limitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers often wonder what's the best
time of year to go through and take their
[SPEAKER_00]: soil sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, really any time the soil is not
frozen is a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: April and May have the highest volume
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will likely slow the response time
of your results and typically not advise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fall is optimum, especially if lime is
thought to be needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can take a long time for that lime
to activate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also allow you to prepare
nutrients ahead of time for sampling in
[SPEAKER_00]: the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're ready to go by the time others
are thinking it's springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then things get very busy and very
limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fall sampling is advised, but really
there's no best time of year any time the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil is not frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how to test the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when you're going about,
you want to search at a local lab and
[SPEAKER_00]: download their instructions and very
importantly, their required paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to read this and follow the
instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have another video on how to
properly take a soil sample as a good
[SPEAKER_00]: guide, but make sure you're also getting
the right paperwork for the lab that
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill it all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write it neatly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mail it off with any payment that's
required with the soil sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll hopefully get results back as
quick as the lab can process them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go through and make adjustments
if you need to, to maximize your plant yield.
