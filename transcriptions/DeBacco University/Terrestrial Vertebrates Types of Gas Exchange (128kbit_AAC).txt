[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at
terrestrial vertebrates and the type of
[SPEAKER_00]: gas exchange that they go about doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping in mind, cells of animals are
going to respire, they're going to require
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen, and they're going to produce
carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it needs to be an efficient way to
exchange those two gases to allow those
[SPEAKER_00]: cells to continue to live and survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at gas exchange in the general
sense, most primitive phylo of organisms
[SPEAKER_00]: obtain oxygen directly from the diffusion
of seawater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, those are all your ocean-based
organisms, not the main focus of this
[SPEAKER_00]: lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keeping in mind here, the picture of
the carp, aquatic animals possess these
[SPEAKER_00]: special respiratory organs called gills.
[SPEAKER_00]: This focus is always on those that are
land-based, such as the bee here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These arthropods use a network of air
ducts called trachea, and we use special
[SPEAKER_00]: organs called lungs to allow an efficient
transfer of gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our first group of organisms that we're
going to look at are amphibians,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are land-based and are able to
respire through moist skin in addition to
[SPEAKER_00]: their lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while the main root of their
respiration is the lungs, they are able to
[SPEAKER_00]: respire through their skin as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a sac with convoluted internal
membranes here that help increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface area at least somewhat,
and this is allowing for gas exchange to
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping in mind that they can also respire
through their skin, and that's why they're
[SPEAKER_00]: typically found in moist environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The image down here shows a cross-section
of the frog skin, just giving an
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciation of what that does actually
look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to our reptiles, they are more
active and as a result need more oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot respire through their skin
because they have water-tight skin,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it allows them to live in more of a
land-based environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, their lung contains many more
small chambers, which greatly increases
[SPEAKER_00]: the overall surface area over our
amphibians.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need that increase in surface area
because they're solely dependent on their
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs, and cannot respire through their
skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, our mammals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have even a greater oxygen demand than
the reptiles or the amphibians,
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly because we maintain this constant
body temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This requires our cells to be very active.
[SPEAKER_00]: We increase our surface area even more
through two specialized structures we see
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The alveoli are small chambers interior of
the lung.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like these kind of grape-like
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bronchials are short passageways that
connect a bunch of these clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this does is this vastly increases
the surface area in our lungs,
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing a very efficient transfer of
oxygen and carbon dioxide, so that our
[SPEAKER_00]: cells, which can respire at a great rate,
were able to maintain that degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: homeostasis.
Thank you.
