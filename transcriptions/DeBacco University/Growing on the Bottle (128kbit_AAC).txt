[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, there's many things that go into an
efficient growing operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I tell this growing on the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this refers to is growing on a
bottled carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of the things that you'll
need to allow the system to work
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some tubing here with some holes
in it to allow delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a timer pictured here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go over a controller where
you would place this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing on the bottle, this is bottled
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is compressed CO2 here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 20 pound bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It consists of that regulator that's
attached to the bottle and a monitor or
[SPEAKER_00]: controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have chosen to use a controller
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is enabled with fuzzy logic to allow
for a precise dosage of CO2 to my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These work in unison to help maintain
predetermined CO2 levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important that all these kind of
work together and are all linked up for
[SPEAKER_00]: the efficient delivery of carbon dioxide
to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the CO2 bottle system, CO2 gas is
stored and sold in metal pressurized
[SPEAKER_00]: cylinders, typically under high pressure
up to 2000 PSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: PSI stands for pounds per square inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 is commonly used for welding,
fire extinguishers, carbonated beverages
[SPEAKER_00]: like sodas, but are common places now in
grow facilities because of the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: for increasing yield assuming CO2 is a
limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CO2 tanks common cylinder sizes are 10
pound, 20 pound, and 50 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, keep in mind that this 10,
20, and 50 pounds is the weight of the CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: you're purchasing and not the total weight
of the CO2 and the bottle that contains
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, a 50 pound steel cylinder
with CO2, with 50 pounds of CO2 will
[SPEAKER_00]: actually weigh about 170 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep this in mind if you're looking at
storing or moving or transporting these
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will weigh much more than just what's
stated or what you may think they weigh.
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 tank safety pressurized bottles can be
dangerous even if the gas inside CO2 is
[SPEAKER_00]: non-flammable and essentially inert.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high pressure can create a rocket-like
effect if the regulator becomes suddenly
[SPEAKER_00]: broken or damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, be sure tanks have a
protective collar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this tank, this would example be an
unsafe tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no protective collar over this
valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was to break.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could create a very dangerous
situation due to the pressurized gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you want to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have that protective collar in
some way over that tank just to help
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the chance of causing any sort of
rocket-like or dangerous conditions if
[SPEAKER_00]: this was to fall over or break or get
damaged here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulator, as I mentioned,
another critical step here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gets hooked up to the bottle right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These work with a controller that gets
plugged in to release CO2 at a
[SPEAKER_00]: predetermined rate, which can be over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Running at 0.08 CFM, or cubic feet per
minute, is considered about the standard
[SPEAKER_00]: just to give you just a general idea of
what to shoot for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be higher or lower than that,
depending on your operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind though, if you are releasing
at very high volumes, about 0.33 cubic
[SPEAKER_00]: feet per minute or greater, when CO2 is
released at these high volumes,
[SPEAKER_00]: there can be a strong cooling effect,
which can freeze the solenoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be an extreme example here of
that cooling effect of high release of
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: To counteract this, some growers will
install a heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at high volume operations where
it will heat the CO2 to eliminate the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulator from freezing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what they look like here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this was attached to the tank and
then this part here would attach to the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: This needs a power source so keep that in
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would need a power source to help
warm up so that the CO2, while this has a
[SPEAKER_00]: strong chilling effect, would not cause
the regulator here to freeze and lock up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to deliver our CO2, an efficient
delivery system, a small eighth inch
[SPEAKER_00]: tubing that has laser holes drilled in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see one right here, one here,
one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: At equal distances to allow for equal
distribution of CO2 over a large area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can allow that it's circulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not just getting one little point
of injection, you're getting over a large
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that delivery system installation,
if you notice the black tubing runs along
[SPEAKER_00]: the back of the grow tank here and it
comes down around here and up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows you to open the doors here
without having tubing to get in the way to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to trim plants or take plants in
or out if needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's those small holes to allow equal
distribution, but I also installed a fan
[SPEAKER_00]: just above them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pointed at a slight downward angle
to help stir the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sensor is also placed above the
tubing allowing for an accurate reading of
[SPEAKER_00]: these conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind it is important to allow
this system to work completely in unison
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is hooked up to a controller with
fuzzy logic.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result this creates a nice way of
dosing CO2 and creating nice consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions for the plants to allow for
efficient operation for the entire grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind also you only want to deliver
CO2 when the lights are on and I control
[SPEAKER_00]: that through the programming of my timer
that has fuzzy logic.
Thanks for watching and I'll see you next
time.
