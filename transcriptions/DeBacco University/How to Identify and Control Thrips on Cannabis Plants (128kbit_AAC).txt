[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
we're going to go over how to identify and
[SPEAKER_00]: control thrips on your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you've ever seen damage like this
on your leaves and flip it over and look
[SPEAKER_00]: very carefully, you might find small
insects that look like this, and these are
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, we're going to go over how
to identify them and control them on your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the description of thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can just see kind of how small they
actually are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half a millimeter is this bar size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really small.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's at least two species of thrips
that are regularly associated with outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grown hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: The onion thrips and the western flower
thrips are considered to be the two of
[SPEAKER_00]: concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Onion thrips have been shown to reduce
yields in indoor growing cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think if you're just growing
indoors, you're free of this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both are very small insects with an
elongated body, typically about 1.2 to 1.5
[SPEAKER_00]: millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically we're using kind of a loop to
kind of go through and identify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you an idea of zoomed in,
how they look.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of your textbook image of how
they look right here for identification
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're looking at kind of looking
at the plant itself, well, we're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of stippling here of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like damage, almost like
someone like rubbed a little portion of
[SPEAKER_00]: that leaf off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the feces can also be seen on
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's small little black dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using blue sticky traps can help make
a positive identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're seeing blue being used,
sometimes a little bit more advised over
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow for certain insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something here just to consider having
maybe multiple colors up for you're able
[SPEAKER_00]: to go through and screen the area for
thrips to identify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully before you see damage to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do see damage to the plants,
how do you go about managing them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, neem oil can be used, but watch for
potential phytotoxicity to the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as final taste and smell impacts,
especially applied later in the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Predythrinz is an insecticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to check your current local
regulations and also watch applying it
[SPEAKER_00]: late in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insecticidal Soper is a general insect
control product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also natural predators,
which are best used when plants are in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower to avoid potential negative impacts
to the final plant product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting those established before the
thrips do gives you a leg up and ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: that the thrips numbers will be kept to a
minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully also any threat of plant
damage also will be kept to a minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for watching and have a great
day.
