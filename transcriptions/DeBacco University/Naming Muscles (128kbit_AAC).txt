[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're gonna look at naming and
identifying some muscles, and I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: this was a very appropriate image to put
as the title slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, going on in naming of skeletal
muscles, well, there's some important
[SPEAKER_00]: factors that go into the naming process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just our random name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The location of the muscle, the bone or
body region associated with that muscle,
[SPEAKER_00]: can affect the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shape of the muscle can be part of the
region where it gets its name.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the deltoid muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deltoid means triangle, also it's a
triangular-shaped muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The relative size, whether it's maximus
being large, minimus being small,
[SPEAKER_00]: or longus being long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Direction of the fibers, rectus or fibers
that run straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transverse and oblique fibers that run at
angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of origins, biceps have two
origins, triceps have three origins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Location of attachments, it's named
according to the point of origin or
[SPEAKER_00]: insertion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the action, flexor or extender.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the names of the muscles that flex or
extend, respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to how these muscles get their
name, a lot of it's derived from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Latin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could look at our Latin roots and be
able to derive the meaning, the muscle
[SPEAKER_00]: that moves things away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I want to highlight in
abductor moves muscles away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you remember from the other lectures
that I did where we talked about angles
[SPEAKER_00]: and movement, abductor moves things away.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, the adductor is a muscle that
moves towards, typically towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: midline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just some examples here that
you're welcome to look at in comparing
[SPEAKER_00]: these two that may sound initially very
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: How they differ and how their Latin root
can help describe the motion that they did
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The overview of muscles, I tried to
highlight some in green that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have you responsible for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean the others are any less
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trying to provide with a little
direction as far as what to expect
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially on one of my quizzes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our deltoid here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, that's a triangle shaped
triceps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three points of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: These maximus big muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just able to go through and identify some
of these key muscles here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adductors.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did those move?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see all the other ones that for
right now I'm leaving out as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing for identification quiz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sphincter is one I do want you to be able
to recognize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little hard to show because it's an
internal muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a ring of muscles
surrounding and serving to guard or close
[SPEAKER_00]: an opening of a tube, such as the openings
of the stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our lower esophageal sphincter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what's sealing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is its closed version.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is its opened version here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's open because we want food to pass
into the stomach, but it's closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want the stomach acid to get into
our esophagus.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've suffered from heartburn,
you may have an improperly closing
[SPEAKER_00]: esophageal sphincter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could lead acid to getting into
the esophagus, creating that burning
[SPEAKER_00]: sensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Muscles that create facial expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: This occipital frontalis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a one right in the front here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how it kind of relates to some
of the names of the bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you can see there's many more
that create facial expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just hiding that one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that terms anterior and
lateral don't go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that helps us be able to determine the
view of the angle that we're getting in
[SPEAKER_00]: these images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Muscles of the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I didn't highlight any of these in
particular, but I want you to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: realize again, lateral versus medial.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Superior going up, inferior going down,
medial going towards the middle region.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the right eye in the anterior view
versus the right eye here with the lateral
[SPEAKER_00]: view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember anterior or lateral,
superior, medial, inferior, all terms that
[SPEAKER_00]: you instill need to be reviewing and
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prostate and lateral views of the neck.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's our trapezius.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want you to be able to recognize it
in two different orientations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our external obliques.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking now at the muscles of the
abdomen region.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to focus on a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one does kind of zoom in a little
bit, but please realize the external
[SPEAKER_00]: obliques are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the zoomed in version.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our pectoralis major.
[SPEAKER_00]: Major being our large muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Muscles that position the pectoral girdle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking again at our scapula
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our sternum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our part of our scapula here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the muscles that attach to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did go over already deltoids and
trapezius, but again, those come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you're able to appreciate the
orientation that they are in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if it says cut, this is the delta
that's been cut in this region to expose
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the other attachment points in
bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please realize that that delta does cover
this entire region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upper arm muscles, our biceps and our
triceps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biceps having two points of origin,
triceps having three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be able to recognize where each of these
are located.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind our anterior view is here on
the left and our posterior here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, our hip and thigh muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that can make you learn a lot of
these, but the quadriceps, the gluteus
[SPEAKER_00]: maxus, and the adductor group all should
be familiar as far as what they do in the
[SPEAKER_00]: relative size comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that's helpful to give you a
brief overview of some of the muscles you
[SPEAKER_00]: should be able to identify and
appreciation for all the muscles that we
[SPEAKER_00]: do have in our bodies and all the
corresponding names.
Thank you.
