[SPEAKER_00]: So on this DeBacco University video,
we're going over a foundational lecture
[SPEAKER_00]: here, understanding PAR, PPFD,
and PFD to maximize cannabis yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not familiar with these
terms, this is a great lecture to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over some of these
foundational terms regarding lighting so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can better understand them and apply
them to different situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, light intensity's
importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the importance of light intensity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the levels of light intensity can
have significant effects on postsynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: rates, which directly relate to a plant's
ability to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measuring the light intensity involves a
few different options, so it's important
[SPEAKER_00]: to know the background of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cover some of the key ones
here in this video lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: When measuring, keep the distance between
the meter and the light source consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: because the light intensity follows the
inversely proportional to the square of
[SPEAKER_00]: the distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the inverse square law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's important to utilize or to
remember is that as you move that meter
[SPEAKER_00]: away from light sources, it tells the
inverse square law, meaning the distance
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to have a major impact on the
intensity that you're going to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure you're keeping
that consistent because even a small
[SPEAKER_00]: distance is going to cause a massive
change potentially in the actual intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: of light, because it's a squared,
distance is squared in that equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light energy at twice the distance
away is spread over four times the area,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's why it's so important to keep
that distance consistent, meaning when you
[SPEAKER_00]: double the distance of light, it will
decrease by 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to be very mindful to keep
things consistent, particularly for
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring light or looking at developing
any sort of comparisons to keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: distance consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're measuring light,
a lot of times you'll see manufacturers
[SPEAKER_00]: mention lumens, and lumen is a standard
derived unit for luminous flux,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is weighted according to the model
of a human's eye sensitivity to various
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, it contains wavelengths
humans can easily see.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no connection to the
photosynthetic process of plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: unlike a PAR reading, which I'll talk
about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the term that gets tossed around is
lumens are for humans, because it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: into account that the lumen is a
measurement of what we can see well,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if we're looking at artificial
lighting, we want to know what the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: can utilize, and that refers to PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lumen readings really are not worth all
that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about that PAR that I had
mentioned, what is PAR?
[SPEAKER_00]: It stands for the photosynthetically
active radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now PAR light, so that's the light when
we're talking now moving away from lumens,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're looking at kind of this idea of
the importance of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this PAR light is the wavelengths of
light within the visible range of 400 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 700 nanometers, which drive the
photosynthetic process, and we see that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of listed right or shown visually
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the PAR reading, and this is kind
of capturing or measuring the those
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths that fall in that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that chlorophyll absorption is higher
in the blue and red portions of the light
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum, so two light sources can have
the same PAR output, but depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths produced, can have different
plant performances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just measuring, and this kind of
bowl here shows kind of the photons that
[SPEAKER_00]: are captured.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have a lot of red and very little
blue, or it could have a lot of blue and
[SPEAKER_00]: very little red, and you might get the
same PAR reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind that PAR
readings are taking no greater emphasis on
[SPEAKER_00]: one wavelength or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the kind of the collection of
all the photons present within that light
[SPEAKER_00]: source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's shown here is also it's not
measured as below 400 and above 700 when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're measuring in PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now PPF, which is the photosynthetic
photon flux, provides the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: photons in the 400 to 700 nanometer
wavelength range again that drive
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis, which are emitted by a
light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same range as PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unit for PPF is the micromoles per
second, and this is the quantity of light
[SPEAKER_00]: particles emitted per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply put, the PPF is the amount per
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking here.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, PPF does not consider a direction
in which the light is emitted,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means it does not indicate the light
that actually reaches the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we see in the example here,
we see our light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see all the light being given off by
that light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if the plant is down below that
light source, these kind of areas here are
[SPEAKER_00]: where the light is being kind of reflected
in an upward direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is being produced, but not necessarily
captured by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this leads us to the PPFD, which is the
photosynthetic photon flux density.
[SPEAKER_00]: This provides the number of photons again
in that 400 to 700 nanometer wavelength
[SPEAKER_00]: range that drive the photosynthetic
process, which are emitted by a light
[SPEAKER_00]: source in the same range as the previous
two talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This unit, again, is micromoles per meter
squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this unit tells you how many photons
which drive photosynthesis impact the area
[SPEAKER_00]: per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply, PPFD is the amount per area,
also per time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of giving you the idea of
now we have this little collection that's
[SPEAKER_00]: at the bottom here, how many are actually
being accumulated per that area over a set
[SPEAKER_00]: number of interval of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're using a reflector,
trying to eliminate the loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to capture as many of those
light wavelengths as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those photons as possible of
different wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we compare PAR to PPF and PPFD,
PAR is the generic term still used in
[SPEAKER_00]: common speech, referred to as the energy
flux or photon flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, its unit is watts per meter
squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPF is used for the amount per time,
usually micromoles per second,
[SPEAKER_00]: and PPFD is used for the amount per area
per time, micromoles per second,
[SPEAKER_00]: per meter squared times second.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFD helps define the intensity of light
over a given area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, instead of just measuring those
photons produced by the light,
[SPEAKER_00]: well now we're looking at how many we're
collecting, ideally hitting the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's limitations to these in
the sense that all of these are bound by
[SPEAKER_00]: that same 400 to 700 nanometer wavelengths
of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in particular with cannabis
research, where UV and far-red wavelengths
[SPEAKER_00]: are of interest, these above terms do not
take into account these wavelengths since
[SPEAKER_00]: they are outside of that 400 to 700
nanometer range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to take into account the greater
wavelengths, there's PFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's taking now going beyond that
limitations before of this 400 to 700
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So PFD or photon flux density is a measure
of the number of photons in the 300 to 800
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometer wavelengths passing through a
particular area per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've expanded that range from all
the way down to 300, all the way up to 800
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unit is micromoles per meter squared
per second, and it's the amount per area
[SPEAKER_00]: per time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measuring that 300 to 800 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not limited to the 400 to 700
talked about previously, those quote
[SPEAKER_00]: unquote photosynthetic wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take into account far-red and also
ultraviolet radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can be very important,
particularly when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production, which is why this PFD
is considered kind of the unit to start to
[SPEAKER_00]: take a look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I mentioned, units are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always check the units used in any work
you're reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micromoles per meter squared per second is
key and what PFD is measured in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see here, different units have
different kind of numbers associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I only weigh 58.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in what units?
[SPEAKER_00]: Standard chicken masses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making up units or not following
certain units, it will allow you to do
[SPEAKER_00]: better comparisons or at least make a
potential for comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep track of the units that a
particular manufacturer might be posting
[SPEAKER_00]: or what a particular scientific study
might be showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at how do we get
those numbers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, light sensors are the primary
instrument used to quantify the light
[SPEAKER_00]: intensities of horticultural lighting
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: These sensors work by using an optical
filter to create a uniform sensitivity to
[SPEAKER_00]: par light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers will use this style for a point in
time measurement, but some options to
[SPEAKER_00]: connect these to data loggers can allow
for an accumulation of readings for
[SPEAKER_00]: different day-to-day comparisons,
which can be quite useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an example here of one of the
meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of use them to get an idea of
the intensity of light just as a point in
[SPEAKER_00]: time, but also link it here and get it
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're measuring that PPFD now,
Apogee, the MQ620 Extended Range PFD
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor allows for UV and far-red photons
to be measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Richards has shown the value of adding UV
and far-red, in particular with canvas
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this meter now can start to measure
some of that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 1040 nanometer top cutoff also means
that the sensor will measure thermal
[SPEAKER_00]: outputs of HPS fixtures and other broad
spectrum lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sensor is intended for use only in
LED environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that just generally mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we get to these higher
nanometer kind of wavelengths,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could also be getting into the thermal
output of certain lights, which might
[SPEAKER_00]: cause readings to be artificially high,
which is why these are typically used more
[SPEAKER_00]: in LED environments where you're not
getting quite those high thermal outputs
[SPEAKER_00]: as you would with a HPS sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can this help to maximize cannabis
yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of putting this together here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, since cannabis is a high light
tolerant plant, there are more potential
[SPEAKER_00]: options when it comes to lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike a lettuce crop that needs lower
intensities, cannabis is a high intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: light plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the ever-changing artificial lighting
market, understanding these terms can help
[SPEAKER_00]: growers make informed decisions,
which is kind of the whole point of this
[SPEAKER_00]: entire channel to allow you to gain some
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also with cannabis, the secondary
compounds are also important for breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: plants with wavelengths outside of the
typical PAR or PPFD spectrum may be
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous when it comes to maximizing
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least knowing that it's being produced
within that wavelength range might help
[SPEAKER_00]: make better informed decisions when you're
starting to make adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with all of this research and all this
information, a couple of people here to
[SPEAKER_00]: thank in the sense that compiled some
information, some research.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are great people to kind of go
through and take a look at as far as some
[SPEAKER_00]: other research that they may have
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to provide a little bit of a
summary here to get you to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: these very important topics and hopefully
it was helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully you're able now to go
through and develop some more comparisons
[SPEAKER_00]: and start asking more educated questions.
