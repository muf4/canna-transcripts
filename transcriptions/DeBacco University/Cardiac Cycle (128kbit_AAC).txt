[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm gonna go over the cardiac
cycle, and if you haven't watched the
[SPEAKER_00]: heart diagram video first, I suggest you
watch that one before continuing with this
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when you watch that one,
develop your own diagram of the square
[SPEAKER_00]: heart, because we're gonna be going
through how the blood flows through the
[SPEAKER_00]: heart, and it'll be helpful if you can
follow along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting in general here, our cardiac
cycle, we have our blood flowing through
[SPEAKER_00]: the heart, and we have our atrium at the
top and our ventricles at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have contractions here of our
different chambers, both atria contract at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time, as do this same with the
two ventricles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gonna push blood throughout the
heart and allow it to fill certain areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping in mind these areas here are the
valves, and will be important for
[SPEAKER_00]: restricting blood and directing it through
the heart so it's most efficiently moved
[SPEAKER_00]: through the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the circulation of the
heart, we're gonna start right here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: right atrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here, blood is gonna flow from the
right atrium into the right ventricle
[SPEAKER_00]: through a one-way tricuspid valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, blue typically represents
deoxygenated blood, even though blood is
[SPEAKER_00]: never blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving from our right ventricle,
blood is then going to the ventricle,
[SPEAKER_00]: will then contract, forcing blood through
the pulmonary valve, which is located
[SPEAKER_00]: right here, into the pulmonary arteries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see those located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulmonary, when I think lungs,
this is what is off to go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: capillaries found in the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxygenated blood will then come from the
lungs and empty into the left atrium,
[SPEAKER_00]: located here, through the pulmonary veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see our pulmonary veins and our left
atrium located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, we're gonna move from the
atrium to the left ventricle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's indicated right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ventricle contracts, forcing blood out
in a single, strong pulse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's important to remember,
we notice our muscle thickness,
[SPEAKER_00]: our atria is much thinner than our
ventricles, particularly our left
[SPEAKER_00]: ventricles, the thickest muscle,
because here we're gonna be pumping blood
[SPEAKER_00]: to the entire body.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bicuspid, or mitral valve,
prevents backflow from forming,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that valve is located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will close, causing this forceful
contraction of the ventricle out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of the body, and that's gonna go out
the aorta, through the aortic valve,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that will prevent backflow into the
ventricle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, our blood eventually will return
to the right atrium, through the superior
[SPEAKER_00]: vena cava, which drains the upper body,
and that's located here, and our inferior
[SPEAKER_00]: vena cava, located here, and that's gonna
drain the lower body, and they're both
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna go into this right atrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a couple other videos you're
welcome to take a look at, but if you kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of follow through these steps,
you hopefully can follow the path of blood
[SPEAKER_00]: through the heart and understand when it
goes through one chamber versus another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind both atria contract at the
same time as you both ventricles,
[SPEAKER_00]: so keep that in mind as you're learning
about the circulation through the heart.
