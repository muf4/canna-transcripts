[SPEAKER_00]: For those that developing a product that
they can ultimately sell to consumers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the packaging is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for cannabis, we're going to go over
some brief cannabis packaging as a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of market your product in what things
you should be looking for, whether you're
[SPEAKER_00]: a consumer or a producer in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So product packaging, heavy-duty bags,
cans, containers can all be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, if you're looking for a
long-term storage, they'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen-filled.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an inert gas to help preserve the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This example of a can here can be used in
sealable bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though nitrogen is the most gas of
highest abundance in the atmosphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: these nitrogen-filled bags will be filled
with near 100% nitrogen there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just helps increase the longevity of
the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, within the product packaging,
I want to keep it light out.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a customer viewing window is
strongly encouraged as this can allow for
[SPEAKER_00]: inspections by your consumer without
opening or breaking the seal of the
[SPEAKER_00]: package.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seals are very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure you're keeping those
contents under controlled conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly if they're nitrogen-filled.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the consumer still wants a way to view
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much like in a grow tank here where we
can have a viewing window where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: peek in and see what you might be
purchasing or might be growing in this
[SPEAKER_00]: case, the same thing should be applied to
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: This window does not need to be super
large, but an area where the consumer can
[SPEAKER_00]: look in and inspect the product that they
are looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Branding, ensuring your customer knows
where their canvas is coming from,
[SPEAKER_00]: is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Branding your product as a result and
having it be effective is important to you
[SPEAKER_00]: as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember though, this can work to help or
hurt you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ensure that there's a quality product
inside and a consistent product inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you produce a poor product and people
associate your name with poor products,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to work against you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you brand your canvas and consumers
like it and it gets sold, that can be much
[SPEAKER_00]: to your benefit in the long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marketing, so not going to get too much
into this, but container size that you
[SPEAKER_00]: use, the shape, the color, the design of
the label all play into marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The picture here of a food store,
again, just showing you all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing that occurs with all the
different fruits and vegetables and
[SPEAKER_00]: products here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many, many options and while
this is important, your first priority,
[SPEAKER_00]: priority number one, should be the actual
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not producing a quality product,
if you're producing a so-so product,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't matter how good your marketing
is, if it's not that great of a product,
[SPEAKER_00]: it won't get sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: People may try it initially because of the
great advertisement or the great color or
[SPEAKER_00]: shape of the container or label,
but ultimately if they find it to be poor
[SPEAKER_00]: quality, they will typically seek out
better quality products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that should be your first step,
but you should still have someone
[SPEAKER_00]: dedicated into marketing and consider this
because it can be a very competitive
[SPEAKER_00]: environment out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure that your high
quality product is being put in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: as many consumers as possible to help
increase sales, to drive the business
[SPEAKER_00]: model that you have.
Thank you.
