[SPEAKER_00]: So in this video here at DeBacker
University, we're going to be looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: and breaking down the five stages of body
decomposition, starting with fresh,
[SPEAKER_00]: going to blow, active decay, advanced
decay, and ending with dry remains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that when we're looking at
this rate of decomposition, there are
[SPEAKER_00]: several factors that will impact that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, age, the younger decompose
quicker than older people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Size, overweight people will decompose
faster than average weight person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clothing, naked bodies will decompose
faster than if they were clothed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Health, sick will decompose faster than
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental temperatures in the range of
70 to 99 degrees Fahrenheit will result in
[SPEAKER_00]: the quickest decomposition times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And location, decomposition is faster in
air and slower in water or soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take these various factors into
consideration for specific situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's going to be the basic five
stages of progression, the rate at which
[SPEAKER_00]: may change based on the factors I just
mentioned there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the fresh stage,
well this starts at the point of death and
[SPEAKER_00]: it continues for the first two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flies will start to arrive, the
temperature will fall to ambient,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the surrounding temperature of
the victim or individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: The abdomen will start to bloat due to
gases produced by the anaerobic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liver, rigor, and algal mortis occur in
this fresh stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see an example of this of a pig
at the fresh stage of decomposition,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we go to bloat stage, one of the
putrification stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is evident by activities of
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically around day four, gases will be
noticed, skin may turn a greenish
[SPEAKER_00]: coloration, the skin may start to break
and fluids may flow out of certain
[SPEAKER_00]: openings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see here that same pig as the
first image going through now the bloat
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Progressing from the bloat stage,
we then go on to the active decay stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this active decay stage,
it's noted by the great loss in mass
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly due to maggot feeding and occurs
about six to eight day time frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Portions of the skin may turn black,
gases will start to escape, and this phase
[SPEAKER_00]: is considered to end when the maggots
leave the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see the breakdown now and the
noticeable evidence here of the change in
[SPEAKER_00]: coloration of our original pig here at the
active decay stage, where black
[SPEAKER_00]: putrification is also may be known as.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on to advanced decay,
this where the body begins to dry and
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve itself in the 10 to 20 day time
frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the flesh is gone at this point,
odor and insect activities are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Waxy layer may develop and kind of this
waxy soap-like substance that forms in the
[SPEAKER_00]: corpse during decomposition under specific
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some refer to it as what's called kind of
grave wax and this is evident or would be
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring during the advanced decay stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, we have the dry remains and
this is the final stage and this is the 50
[SPEAKER_00]: plus day range and this is the loss of
everything in the body except the dry
[SPEAKER_00]: bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this dry remains stage, also known as
the skeletization phase, simply because
[SPEAKER_00]: only the skeleton, only the bones are left
from this stage on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
