[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBacco University video,
I'm going to be going over the container
[SPEAKER_00]: types for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a couple labeled here, shown here
in the images, but we're going to go into
[SPEAKER_00]: them in a little bit more detail,
give you some of the advantages and
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantages of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the goal of all containers
is to hold a growing substrate in an area
[SPEAKER_00]: where the roots will grow and develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The type of container selected can depend
on the growing conditions and also
[SPEAKER_00]: possible points of transplant that's
planned as the plant grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going to move this plant
potentially going forward that can
[SPEAKER_00]: influence potentially your decision or
allow you to make the best decision to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow an easing of that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, starting with the kind of the most
obvious, what you're probably most
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with, and that's plastic
containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why they're probably most
familiar or most obvious is they're cheap,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're easy to get, and they come in a
variety of sizes, all great advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, some of the downfalls can be the
storage, particularly in large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: production, shipping, if you're buying
them by the pellet and then we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at just transporting them to the facility
and also disposal of them when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: gone through at least one growth cycle or
some are reusing them, but disposal when
[SPEAKER_00]: they've kind of gotten past their shelf
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to air pots, which is kind of
like a division of plastic pots to some
[SPEAKER_00]: extent, but you notice that they look very
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They allow for the air pruning of roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're kind of allowing or preventing
the roots from getting pot bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So allowing air to get in and kind of self
prune those roots before they come in
[SPEAKER_00]: contact with the edge of the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: This increases the root branching and
maximizes the use of container area with
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the downfall, because there are
literal holes here on the sides,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as underneath, is that they can
dry out quicker and growers may need to
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust their irrigation frequency and or
durations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to fabric containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for our fabric containers, they store
well in small places.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very easy to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also increase aeration of the
root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All great positives.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the fabric, depending what fabric
you get, they can break down over time,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly if you use an outdoor
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also can be hard to clean because
that fabric tends to bind and hold on to
[SPEAKER_00]: things and the bottoms can rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the bottom of the actual pot
because it usually comes down to
[SPEAKER_00]: containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in kind of with the surface
that's been growing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can trap a lot of moisture in there and
as a result, it can cause a rot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: container itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then lastly, we get to biodegradable
containers and the advantages that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: environmentally friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can make transplant very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just plant the whole pot and container.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also minimize the root disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: All great benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the time to break down can vary,
depend on the type of biodegradable pot
[SPEAKER_00]: you select.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can dry out faster due to the wicking
of moisture and their costs can be higher
[SPEAKER_00]: than some of the previous items mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for all of these container types,
if there's one you want to learn a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more about, because you like the
advantages and can dissuade some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantages, you're welcome to check out
this channel for more detail explaining
[SPEAKER_00]: each of these container types.
