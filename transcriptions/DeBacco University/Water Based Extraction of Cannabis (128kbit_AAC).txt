[SPEAKER_00]: Are you considering water-based extraction
of your cannabis plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this Tobacco University video will
provide you some more details to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: this extraction process is a good fit for
your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over water-based
extraction of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, with water-based,
there's actually two main extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both are solvent-free concentrate,
which customers are often looking for,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's cold water and then there's
hot water extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, looking at the cold water or
ice water extraction method, this utilizes
[SPEAKER_00]: a solvent-less method of extraction that
submerges finely chopped cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material into freezing water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is stirred in the cold water,
causing the trichomes to separate off from
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the trichomes fall off the plant,
it will pass through a series of screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The end result is a product that has 50%
to 70% THC levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, again, something that can be
very easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't require a ton of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is hot water extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this uses pressurized hot water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this kind of more equipment
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It offers the advantage of being a safer
alternative to other extraction methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn about more of those
other extraction methods here in Tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: University, you can search some of those
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: The protocols developed to select against
THC in some conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The optimal conditions to extract more
CBD, CBC, or CBG than THC and CBN were set
[SPEAKER_00]: at 150 degrees Celsius, 106 degrees
Celsius, and 45 minutes as extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature at the collector vesicle
and the extraction time, respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can show you how this method still
can allow some degree of specificity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's much more than just taking
cannabis with some kind of cheesecloth and
[SPEAKER_00]: some boiling water and pouring it through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Description of this pressurized hot water
method, showing a little image right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The desired sample is placed in the cell
for extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cell is then heated to a predetermined
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The system is then filled with water and
then pressurized.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sample is then kept at the exact
conditions until sufficient breakdown of
[SPEAKER_00]: the solutes is achieved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that duration of time will kind of be
set by protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: The used solvent is then let out of the
cell and the extraction solvent is forced
[SPEAKER_00]: through a system for a predetermined time
known as the dynamic extraction time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resulting sample is then rapidly
cooled in ice water using a glass flask to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent degradation of the extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we can see the solvent system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the pump, the flow direction,
preheating, extraction cell, black
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure regulator, and then collecting
flask.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this should be chilled down here as
part of the pressurized hot water system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's the resulting end product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the trichomes are what's removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a closed loop system and will
produce a thick, goopy substance ranging
[SPEAKER_00]: from a yellow to a brown coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different temperatures and pressures will
result in different end product
[SPEAKER_00]: consistencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically THC levels range in the 70 to
90% range.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages of a water-based extraction
method is that the elimination of
[SPEAKER_00]: additional sample cleanup, reduction in
organic solvent consumption, highly
[SPEAKER_00]: selective, extraction efficiency,
ease of automation, and a cheap solvent,
[SPEAKER_00]: goods mainly using just water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, lastly, there are some disadvantages
with any method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for water-based extractions,
a relatively expensive startup cost can
[SPEAKER_00]: have long residence times of extracts,
which has an increased risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: phytochemical degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep those in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't think this is a fit,
you might want to explore some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other methods to see if one of those might
be a better fit for your given situation.
