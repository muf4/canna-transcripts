[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over some more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: specifics when you're looking at flipping
your plants or transitioning them from the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative to the flowering cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's go over flipping indoor
cannabis plants from the vegetative to
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the change.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at making that change,
growers growing photo period-dependent or
[SPEAKER_00]: even auto flower plants need to realize
their plants need to go through a shift
[SPEAKER_00]: from reducing leaves to flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in auto flowers, of course,
that will happen naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photo period-dependent, you have the
opportunity to decide when that change
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because with photo period-dependent
strains, growers have more control over
[SPEAKER_00]: when this actually happens, there needs to
be a consideration for how to best prepare
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant to maximize your growing
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're using light sources that
have strong red wavelengths, such as high
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure sodiums, this will increase the
tenses for plants to stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be mindful if you're in a ceiling
or height limited growing situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the photo period itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for photo period-dependent
cultivars, a simple switch from an 18 plus
[SPEAKER_00]: hours of continuous light to 12 hours of
continuous light will shift the plant at
[SPEAKER_00]: any age to focus on flower production and
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auto flowers are based on the days old and
the day that the plants will shift from
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative to flowering will depend on the
exact strain grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind with those photo
period-dependent, you have the option.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do it when they're really small.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do it when they're really tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't really matter to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's exposed to that 12 hours,
it's going to go through and produce those
[SPEAKER_00]: development of those flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: As growers, we need to be mindful of how
our plants look so we can maximize the
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now light limitations with the photo
period-dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photo period-dependent strains will only
allow growers to provide it with 12 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be the maximum light intensity and
supplementing with carbon dioxide so their
[SPEAKER_00]: plants use high light intensity since the
duration will no longer be the 12 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that light intensity important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the goal is to try to maintain a
high DLI, which stands for daily light
[SPEAKER_00]: integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because you're reducing the duration of
lakes, you're limited by how much,
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing the intensity is advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to allow plants to utilize that higher
intensity, sampling with carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: enrichment for indoor locations,
it will allow plants to utilize a greater
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage or intensity of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're looking at photo
period-independent, such as auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do we do with those if we're choosing
to grow those plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the advantage of auto flowers
being photo period-independent is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they can handle longer durations of light
to help maximize light, which is important
[SPEAKER_00]: considerations for growers since the days
of plant production are limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, since it doesn't matter kind of what
you expose them to for light, running
[SPEAKER_00]: lights longer for auto flowers can help
increase productivity because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: giving them a better chance to go through
and produce those necessary sugars and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, while the cost of running lights
and potential cooling should also be
[SPEAKER_00]: factored in because running plants for 20
hours at high intensity with carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide can help maximize the harvest from
these plants because this will maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: the DLI, the daily light integral that
those plants receive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are increasing the intensity,
keep in mind, there's only so much plants
[SPEAKER_00]: can use under ambient carbon dioxide
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So enriching that environment will
increase the intensity that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as you mentioned, ceiling height is
an important consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your grow space is ceiling height
limited, this can impact when the flip is
[SPEAKER_00]: made for photo period dependence and or
the pruning style you use for auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that just because plants are in
flower development mode doesn't mean that
[SPEAKER_00]: they will stop growing in vertical height.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still will continue to grow in height
while not as much as in the vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing a sativa dominant
strain, this will stretch more than an
[SPEAKER_00]: indica dominant in morphology,
regardless of the increase in height can
[SPEAKER_00]: be around 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because they stop, they're going to
continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important when considering the
distance plants should be kept from lights
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, this height limitation tends to
be more of an issue for smaller grow tents
[SPEAKER_00]: than actual grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just because the ceiling is high
doesn't mean you have to also consider
[SPEAKER_00]: where the lights are hanging as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, plant age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with auto flowers, plant age determines
the transition point for photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: dependence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers may decide to make the change in
the photo period based on the plant's age
[SPEAKER_00]: again to maximize productivity and
efficiency of their grow operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best age is dependent on many factors
such as pruning style, physical space of
[SPEAKER_00]: the growing area, and physical space of
the growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a general starting point is to
flow plants into flower when they have
[SPEAKER_00]: reached about half their total height you
want them to reach just as a heads up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at up-hotting plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another important part of the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many growers take the time around flipping
their plants to change their containers or
[SPEAKER_00]: up-pot their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is typically a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, be sure not to plan everything on
the same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be great for the grower,
not so great for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of the plant should be up-potted
and then growers should wait about three
[SPEAKER_00]: days before altering the photo period to
induce flowering, simply to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: stress that's going on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the potting process, that's going to
be a stress on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you flip it the same day,
that could be too much and could stunt the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you're planning for the stretch,
this kind of gives you just a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of a kind of an image here as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the plant, the tent height
is seven feet or 84 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top of the tent to the bottom of the
lights is 21 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking basically right here with
16 inch spacing between the plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: lights required to give a total of 63
inches of grow space remaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is located basically right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the container is 13 inches tall,
resulting in total of 50 inches of
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment height space being taken up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you have this total height
of the grow tent, you also have to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider the distance your lights are
hanging from the top, the distance the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil line is up from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this limits 34 inches of plant height
in the growing space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when plants reach 50 percent of
possible growing space, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: 17 inches, the flowering photo period
should be initiated, at least as a good
[SPEAKER_00]: starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're thinking, oh, seven feet,
84 inches, plenty of growing space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, really, when it comes to actual
plant space, you only have about 34
[SPEAKER_00]: inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, take all these factors into
consideration so you don't get caught with
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants running into the lights or
having to do something that's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be very plant conducive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take into consideration the actual growing
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initiate that flowering halfway through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that should offer you a very good
starting point for your plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine when you should flip them from
the vegetative photo period to the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering one.
