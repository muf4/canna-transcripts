[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to be investigating
body joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Body joints can be used for a high degree
of flexibility or can be used to help in
[SPEAKER_00]: sports kind of make different moves and
there's a lot of stress and strain put on
[SPEAKER_00]: joints in many sporting events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So joints in general, what are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're articulations of bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The functions of joints, they hold bones
together and they allow for mobility and
[SPEAKER_00]: ways joints are classified both on their
function and also how they are structured.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here just a general joint
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to learn more about the
different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also our joints in the skull here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may not consider these as being very
mobile because they're not, but these
[SPEAKER_00]: nonetheless are still joints that occur in
the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: The structural classification of joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our fibrous joints which are
generally immovable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have up here in our skull region
cartilaginous joints which are immovable
[SPEAKER_00]: or only slightly movable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might have those found, for example,
the discs of cartilage that help support
[SPEAKER_00]: our vertebrae and synovial joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the ones that are freely
movable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the ones we may think of
initially when we think of a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our fibrous joints are strong
connections between bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bones are united by fibrous tissue and the
reason is they lack a lot of motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sutris are one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're non-moving joints of the skull.
[SPEAKER_00]: Syndesmosis are where ligaments connect
two bones allowing for a minimal movement
[SPEAKER_00]: such as between the ulna and the radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gummophis here is the specialized
fibrous joint that anchors a tooth to its
[SPEAKER_00]: socket in the jaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these are examples of fibrous
joints here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These fibrous joints are really strong
connections and allow for potentially some
[SPEAKER_00]: movement, but not a lot or high degree of
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very minimal in the amount they can move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cartilaginous joints are examples of our
bones connected with hyaline cartilage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Symphiasis here is compressible
fibrocartilaginous pads connecting two
[SPEAKER_00]: bones allowing for some movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of our minimal movement between bones,
in this case we're having a padding that's
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why there's cartilage present there
and that's why it's considered a joint,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not a lot of movement between those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Syncradosis are immovable cartilaginous
joints that can be found at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: long bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows bones to grow in length.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pubic portions of the right and left
hip bones of the pelvis are joined
[SPEAKER_00]: together by this fibrocartilage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this area here, remember if we want to
identify a male or a female, we look
[SPEAKER_00]: typically in this region to be able to do
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arsinovial joints, I said probably the
ones we may consider most as joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the articulating bones are separated
by a joint cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bone surfaces are protected by articular
cartilage and synovial joints are found in
[SPEAKER_00]: the joint cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are six main different types all
present here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like about this picture is not only
does it show you all the joints,
[SPEAKER_00]: it also shows where you can find those on
the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to present these three at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those synovial joints, the general
structure of them, they have cartilage,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have that synovial cavity,
they have the articular cavity,
[SPEAKER_00]: also the synovial fluid and reinforcing
ligaments.
[SPEAKER_00]: These joints in which articulating bones
are separated by fluid-containing joint
[SPEAKER_00]: cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why we want this
joint-containing fluid is it helps create
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice lubricating barrier surface between
the two bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to have bone-on-bone
contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fluid allows for ease of movement
between these two articulating bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, looking at some of the joints
here, we have pivot joints which provides
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top of the spine, the atlas and the
axis, remember the yes, no, the C1,
[SPEAKER_00]: C2 vertebrae, they are actually portions
of a pivot joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hinge joints move on just one axis and
these joints allow for flexion and
[SPEAKER_00]: extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Major hinge joints include the elbow and
also our finger joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are examples of hinge joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saddle joints are for flexion and
extension and other movements but no
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the hand, the thumb, the saddle joint
between the first metacarpal and the
[SPEAKER_00]: trapezius lets the thumb cross over the
palm making it opposable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our opposable thumb would be an example
there and that's called a saddle joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plane joints move against each other in a
single plane and we see that indicated
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example on the body would be between
the tarsal bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also major gliding joints include the
vertebral joints of the bones of the wrist
[SPEAKER_00]: and the ankles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember our ankles share a lot of
similarities with our wrists.
[SPEAKER_00]: The condyloid joints allow for circular
motion, flexion and extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are wrist joints between the radius
and the carpal bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this specific region right here,
we have that example of that circular
[SPEAKER_00]: motion that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball and socket joint is a freely
movable joint that can rotate on any axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example of that here would be our hip
joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top portion of our femur articulating
with our hip bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now talk about joints, talk about cracking
your knuckles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what causes our knuckles to pop?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go through and watch some of these
videos and help understand a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about what's actually going on with when
we crack our knuckles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
