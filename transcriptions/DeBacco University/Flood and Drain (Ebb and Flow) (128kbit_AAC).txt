[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at the flood and
drain system of hydroponics also can be
[SPEAKER_00]: called the ebb and flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basic setup is an area here where the
plants are with a water reservoir below
[SPEAKER_00]: with a pump that will pump the water up
causing this tray area to flood and then
[SPEAKER_00]: after a period of time that water will
drain back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is being set on a timer and this will
be repeated as needed depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the flood drain system basics in more
detail on the hydroponic lecture this is
[SPEAKER_00]: the same system is not used unique to
cloning so you may have heard something
[SPEAKER_00]: like this used for clones but it can also
be used a lot of times for the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: production of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be scaled to match operation size
whether it's a small grotan or a very
[SPEAKER_00]: large operation this system can be used in
both situations as well as medium-sized
[SPEAKER_00]: operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The systems include a table so we see here
where the plants are being supported a
[SPEAKER_00]: pump right here water reservoir is not
pictured would go where the pump would be
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting in that reservoir but I removed
that for the image and then the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: media as we see here where the plants are
actively growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic operation involves flooding part
of the root zone allowing water to wick up
[SPEAKER_00]: the media before it drains away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind the flood only takes a short
period of time to saturate the media
[SPEAKER_00]: before it drains away we're not holding
that water there for a very long period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time typically five to ten minutes at the
most.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows for adequate moisture by still
allowing the roots to breathe because if
[SPEAKER_00]: we left that water there for too long the
roots would essentially drowned and not be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to respire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we're using smaller operations or
if we're using this in clone operations it
[SPEAKER_00]: can utilize humidity domes makes an easy
way to evenly water a large quantity of
[SPEAKER_00]: clones efficiently and as I said it can
also be used for large-scale production
[SPEAKER_00]: but because we are pumping that water in
from the bottom we can use humidity domes
[SPEAKER_00]: if they are needed for the growing
environment that those plants are being
[SPEAKER_00]: placed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drawbacks are that it's dependent on
electrical pumps and timers some setup
[SPEAKER_00]: there's keeping the tray clean there's
installing the tray there's getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: right table all these come into the flood
and drain operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH needs to be monitored or many clones
can be stunted or killed and the same can
[SPEAKER_00]: go for the full-size plants there that we
can also stunt or kill even full-size
[SPEAKER_00]: plants but it'll be much quicker for
clones due to their very weak root
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the ebb and flow or the flood and
drains is what it actually looks like easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to use and very reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It utilizes a growing table or bench in
this growing bed it recirculates nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: solution to reduce loss of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The solution floods the growing table with
one to three inches of nutrient solution
[SPEAKER_00]: which is allowed to drain down the crop
and then refill the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens here is this lower area
here is where the water will be pumped in
[SPEAKER_00]: to actively a pump and this simply will
allow a drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this can be adjusted based on height
we can put another spacer in here to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it even taller if we would like what this
means is that if the pump for some reason
[SPEAKER_00]: was to continually to run so if the timer
was to fail this would prevent the pump
[SPEAKER_00]: pumping out all the water burning up the
pump and flooding the entire room here
[SPEAKER_00]: this would automatically drain back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now naturally when the pump turns off what
is great is that the water will back flow
[SPEAKER_00]: back down the hose here and refill the
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that you want to keep the
size of the tubing for the pump to be
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller than the size of the tubing for
the drain this way it is impossible for
[SPEAKER_00]: the pump to over compensate for the amount
of nutrient solution that can drain back
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result this will maintain a very
consistent maximum height and then your
[SPEAKER_00]: timer will adjust the amount of time that
water is spent here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is as I said scalable it can be
used for one plant can be used for you
[SPEAKER_00]: know a million plus plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often used for propagation in clones
but can also be used for large plants as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes this so great is that it is
very easy to automate and this is part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the reason why it can be used at such a
large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's commonly used with Rockwell as this
offers the ability to flush the system and
[SPEAKER_00]: pushes air out on the flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens as water comes in it
pushes the air out and as the water drains
[SPEAKER_00]: away it can pull in fresh air increasing
the oxygen content within those fibers in
[SPEAKER_00]: the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: As water drains away from that media that
air is being pulled in this increases the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for oxygen concentration to help
the roots breathe which is advantageous
[SPEAKER_00]: for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's increasing in popularity we're using
Rockwell more with the flood and drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grotan is a very popular system to be used
with hydroponics as a result they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: great lineup of products that allow clones
to be easily propagated then then stepped
[SPEAKER_00]: up to these larger blocks and then you can
go to even larger blocks for large-scale
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Grotan or Rockwell is being
utilized in combination with ebb and flow
[SPEAKER_00]: on a very large scale but it can also be
scaled down to smaller operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is a volume so this typically
system requires high volumes of water but
[SPEAKER_00]: losses can be reduced with sealable
reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind when we are sitting that
reservoir we don't want to keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: completely airtight we just want a lid
over that to help reduce the amount that
[SPEAKER_00]: may be lost to evaporation because that
can be one way if we lose that water at a
[SPEAKER_00]: very increased rate what will happen is
the nutrient solution may become more
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated in that reservoir if it's not
monitored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again just a couple things to keep in
mind but ebb and flow is a very popular
[SPEAKER_00]: method very efficient method and one that
be should be considered for any grow
[SPEAKER_00]: operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
