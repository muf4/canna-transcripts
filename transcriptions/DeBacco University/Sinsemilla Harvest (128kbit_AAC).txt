[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over a
sensomilla harvest for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see two buds here that fit this
quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, sensomilla refers to not
being pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If these flowers have been pollinated,
they would shift their energy into seed
[SPEAKER_00]: production and reduce the resins and
cannabinoids that we're typically seeking
[SPEAKER_00]: for growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this sensomilla harvest typically
occurs about six to 12 weeks after plants
[SPEAKER_00]: have been exposed to an even 12-hour
light, 12-hour dark photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the range is a little broad because
of different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, auto-flowering varieties
will not necessarily follow this because
[SPEAKER_00]: they are not sensitive to changing photo
periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at determining and
timing that harvest, the trichome color is
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going to determine the peak
ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes, because they produce the
resins, their color is a key indicator
[SPEAKER_00]: when peak ripeness does occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to get a developed translucent
kind of fate white trichome with a large
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too early, these trichomes' structures
will be thin and clear and not fully
[SPEAKER_00]: mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And too late, the structures will have a
brown-tan orange coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, though, some cultivars tend
to produce more darker trichomes at
[SPEAKER_00]: maturity, so be mindful of what cultivar
you're actually growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you determine this color?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's by observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to inspect those trichomes with a
30X loop as a strong LED light built in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This way, you can expect and determine
exactly when to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it takes a little getting used to
here, but it really allows to magnify
[SPEAKER_00]: those trichomes to make it much easier to
determine exactly when they're ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: The goals to harvest when about half of
the observed trichomes are faint white and
[SPEAKER_00]: translucent color.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of give the idea of the jellyfish
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that faint white to translucent
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a small, detailed operation,
you can even select individual buds for
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest to ensure each one is removed at
the exact correct day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of gives you a little bit of
that real-world image of kind of how it
[SPEAKER_00]: should look.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a small operation, you can
select individual buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often, that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to inspect some representative
sample buds that you have, and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for that translucent to faint
white color.
[SPEAKER_00]: When about half of the trichomes in a bud
have that, that's when you can go through
[SPEAKER_00]: and harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you start to learn a cultivar,
you'll start to know how many days,
[SPEAKER_00]: since you flip the lights, it will produce
this and allows for a more efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the key part here is to have a good
magnifying loop, use your observations,
[SPEAKER_00]: watch the buds, and don't harvest them too
early or too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch that peak ripeness so you get the
maximum yield for the effort that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: put in.
