[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
if you're looking at irrigating plants
[SPEAKER_00]: with pond water, this video should be of
interest to you because we're going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: over some of the specifics you should be
considering if you're going to be using
[SPEAKER_00]: pond water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go over utilizing pond water for
outdoor cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, your goal should be with
really any water is to test the base
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the natural water?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you starting with?
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter the source, you need to have an
idea of what the base water source has as
[SPEAKER_00]: a starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basics such as parts per million or EC and
pH, and also the temperature should be
[SPEAKER_00]: easily determined with a quality water
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just important to know what
you're starting with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The specifics of the pond water also
include analysis for microbial life within
[SPEAKER_00]: the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more specific to your pond water.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of algae might be living in
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of microbial life?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of microbial pressure you might
have with the water you're intending to
[SPEAKER_00]: use for irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, pond water itself likely contains
sediment as well as microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that sediment could be just from
runoff, could be because of heavy rainfall
[SPEAKER_00]: infiltrating into the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these items, the sediment and the
microbes, should be removed before
[SPEAKER_00]: entering the irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sediment should be removed because it
can clog vital components, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes can grow inside the irrigation
lines or potentially damage the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are important things to kind of
go through and remove, and there's filters
[SPEAKER_00]: for each of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers should be implementing these
filters to remove these from the
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's okay if they're in the original
water, but they should not be in the water
[SPEAKER_00]: that is actually reaching the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are some filtration options.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is looking at some here for the
sediment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sediment filters remove the visible
particulate matter and many particles of
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt, sand, dust, and debris that can be
caught by its micron rated capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the smaller the microns,
the smaller the filter, the smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: particles it will be removing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sediment filters also remove the turbidity
from the water, so it can make it have a
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the limitations of sediment
filters are that they do not remove
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals, heavy metals, bacteria,
or any dissolved particulate matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also do not improve the taste or
smell of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only like a physical screen as a
way to think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are different types of sediment
filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see here there's a pleated filter
located right here, and it's best suited
[SPEAKER_00]: for large particulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also washable and reusable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's meltblown filters,
and they're best suited for finer
[SPEAKER_00]: particulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's string wound filters,
looking right below me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once overloaded, the sediment will
pass through them, indicating there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: need for a filter change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this could cause issues down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some growers will kind of run one
filter to remove some of the larger
[SPEAKER_00]: particulate, and then another stage filter
to remove some finer particulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: String wound filters, great way while
they're working, but once they get full,
[SPEAKER_00]: sediment will pass through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we see here there's bag filters,
and they can change in micron size between
[SPEAKER_00]: one and 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have spun down filters are designed
to remove large size debris from the
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see you don't need to use all
of these, but a lot of growers are
[SPEAKER_00]: choosing to use multiple stages of filters
to ensure they're removing all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: particulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how frequently should you change a
filter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this depends on kind of many
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: One reliable method is to watch for a
pressure drop, meaning a full filter this
[SPEAKER_00]: filter was full, meaning clogged with
sediment, will cause a reduced in water
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the general recommendation is to change
the filter, or at least check it every six
[SPEAKER_00]: to 12 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: But installing pressure kind of gauges
before and after the filter, can see if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a, they should be both reading the
same, but if one starts reading very
[SPEAKER_00]: differently, that can be an indication
that the filter might be getting clogged
[SPEAKER_00]: or filled with sediment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, also within our ponds, we also want
to be considerate of the microbes that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be present within the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to remove those, a UV light can be
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: UV light is an electromagnetic radiation
with the wavelength of 180 nanometers to
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 nanometers, and is damaging to living
organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbes such as bacteria, diatons,
floating algae, parasitic protozoa,
[SPEAKER_00]: and others will be killed from exposure to
a UV pond filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dead algae cells clump together and then
are trapped in the filter, which reduces
[SPEAKER_00]: the turbidity and also improves the water
clarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that here, with fish tank
filters, UV fish tank filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they do work in the same way,
but a UV pond filter typically can handle
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit more capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep in mind, it's the same
concept, but a little different setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's two types of these UV pond
filters, UV clarifiers and UV sterilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: UV clarifiers will have the light
intensity, will have the kind of lighter
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity than a sterilizer, removing only
bacteria and algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sterilizers require water to flow much
slower through them to ensure more
[SPEAKER_00]: thorough exposure, removing parasitic
protozoa, which need a longer exposure
[SPEAKER_00]: time from the UV light to be killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're getting a clarifier,
typically they're more higher flow,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're less intensity, they're kind of
like cleaning the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sterilizing the water, to some extent,
requires more intense light and slower
[SPEAKER_00]: flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically you're looking at the degree
of what you may have to be cleaning out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sterilizers would be preferred if your
system can allow that to be utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the cost of the UV filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the low investment is about two,
$300 with a yearly cost of about 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: High-end investments could be over 800
with 150 plus yearly cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's installation cost to consider,
unit cost, electricity, the bulb itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: that should be changed also based on a
manufacturer's recommendations cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these average costs do not account for
any extra maintenance that might occur if
[SPEAKER_00]: the UV pond filter is jammed or in poor
condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is just here to provide you
with a general estimate, general kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of what the cost may be if you're
considering this type of filtration
[SPEAKER_00]: method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, talking about that filter
or that you should say that UV bulb
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, it's recommended that those bulbs
are replaced 60 days before the stated
[SPEAKER_00]: expiration date.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of similar to grow lights
just because a UV bulb produces light
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't mean that it's definitely
necessarily a productive light or as
[SPEAKER_00]: productive as it once was at doing its
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the bulbs are weak, they can lead to
bacteria outbreaks or basically not
[SPEAKER_00]: perform the necessarily job that you
expect them to perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the amount of naturally
intended microbes and macro organisms,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are different levels of toxicity
with these pond inhabitants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can also play into the amount of
time you're running the filter,
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of time the bulb is on,
the amount of water you're pushing through
[SPEAKER_00]: it, all these factors come into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully this provides you just a
general overview to get you by some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those initial steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're choosing to implement this,
you can implement it in an effective way.
