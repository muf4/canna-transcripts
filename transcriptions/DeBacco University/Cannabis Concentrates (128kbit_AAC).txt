[SPEAKER_00]: So while there's many cannabis
concentrates, we're going to focus just on
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple here to try to give a little more
background information exactly what those
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis concentrates, well,
the whole goal is to refine extract from
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes to purify the cannabinoids and
create an end product with more
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency than the flower or bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flowers can have a lot of variability
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result or concentrate is to take that
and condense it down to have a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more of a consistent product, something
that maybe contains a certain chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Batter is something that's a cake-like
batter or malleable consistency,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this term is more to do with the
actual consistency of the product rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than the actual chemical profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't confuse this term a special type
of oil or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The T's have simply replaced with D's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crumble is kind of in the same category
where it's a dry oil as nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: different concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only refers to the consistency such as
like breadcrumbs or crumb topping here,
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing to do with, again, the chemical
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shatter is a translucent product made with
a solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It typically has this amber-like
coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentrates can be a very potent
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires a special apparatus to use
called a rig and heats the product to 575
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees or to 625 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this does is creates an instant
vaporization of the product, which can
[SPEAKER_00]: cause an overwhelming high, especially for
those high in THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can be a concern or something to
use in moderation because of the instant
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporization.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way the shatter is used can create
this overwhelming high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distillate is another form.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is refined cannabinoid oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often the end product that's free of
taste, smell, and flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's commonly used in edibles and vape
pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the picture here of moonshine
because that's kind of the distilled
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That same occurs with self-buried alcohol
from water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're kind of using the same idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same process to separate out certain
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry Sift is a ground and screened
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains the full trichome profile,
which growers really look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally sifted through a screen to
create this very consistent product in
[SPEAKER_00]: texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash or bubble hash is compressed resin
that's derived and separated in trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: that are condensed with heat and pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This produces a very potent product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubble hash is more refined than
traditional hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not quite as refined as the
shatter I talked about previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosin, as a name, originates from a
product used to lubricate via limbos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't think that all the cannabis
people here have generated completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a simple and easy process.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least the basic idea is the creation of
rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made from the entire cannabis bud and
considered to be very versatile,
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient, and a safe method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Safer than some of the others because it
contains no solvents in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, it produces a high-grade
concentrate that can be used in a variety
[SPEAKER_00]: of end products there.
