[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be investigating
animal hair comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we can see some obvious
differences here at the macroscopic level,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to be looking more at the
microscopic comparisons of different
[SPEAKER_00]: animal hairs from different animals as
well as with on the same animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, animal hairs in general do
not possess enough individual microscopic
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics to exclude other similar
animals and can be associated with a
[SPEAKER_00]: unique individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just kind of looking at just
generally classifying them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the question here exhibits the same
microscopic characteristics as a known
[SPEAKER_00]: hairs, it's concluded that the hair is
consistent originating from that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see here we're maybe
comparing different pelts of different
[SPEAKER_00]: animal hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at the images,
and I'm going to include hopefully quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: few of them, so you can be able to kind of
get that nice little comparison between
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be thinking about the diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medulla, the scales, and the general
patterns of those hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, what's the diameter?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the medulla?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the repeating?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of shape the perimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the width and the length?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, measured in microns here if
provided a scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're seeing just kind of that
example of how we might want to break down
[SPEAKER_00]: one of these microscopic images going
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a general comparison, just looking
at kind of the obvious classification,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can see some very stark differences
here looking at scale casts, looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of cuticle region of how some
are kind of like all interlocked with one
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: How have these definite kind of like
scales of a fish interlocked together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The river otter here having a little bit
more of that irregular pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just having no background,
just kind of looking at these four images,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can clearly see some differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on to looking at comparing
fibers within one family.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all classified under the rodent
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still we can see that there are some
differences here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, maybe not as starkly different as
the last image, but definitely when
[SPEAKER_00]: matching an unknown sample up to some
knowns, we could definitely see where we
[SPEAKER_00]: could at least eliminate some potential
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just taking one example here,
looking at the links for example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at kind of the diameter
and the medulla, as I said, here we have
[SPEAKER_00]: the little bar here representing 20
micrometers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're seeing, this would be the
diameter of 40 microns and the medulla of
[SPEAKER_00]: 35.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that the guard cell from
links number one is what's shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cells in the medulla are long,
flat in shape that span the width of the
[SPEAKER_00]: medulla.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the cells are slightly cupped with
many bubble-like features between the
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is continuous repeating S-shaped
running between the cells throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: medulla.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the images down here, all the images
on this slide are all from the links.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind we have the guard scale cast
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're taking a casting of the actual
kind of cuticle region.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the guard here pictured here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the underfur and then we have a
different area here of the underfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that there are some
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that we're here,
we're looking at a general comparison
[SPEAKER_00]: between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to keep that in mind
when we're trying to make some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: matches or classifications of here that
might be found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on here for the red fox.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you kind of see that similar image,
like a diameter, look at the medulla here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cross red fox, guard here, and polarized
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how we look at it can also impact the
image that we may see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're seeing the cells of the medulla
appear as wide, flat, and shaped with no
[SPEAKER_00]: regular boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some places the cells appearing
angular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the guard cell at 400 times
magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the guard scale with the scale
cast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, as we're kind of taking that
cuticle region and getting a cast,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of an impression, if you will,
of that cuticle region.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the midsection of the guard here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind where you're taking that,
the lower section, the mid or the outer,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of more towards the tip region,
that can impact potentially what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to see in an image.
[SPEAKER_00]: So important to document that when you're
taking pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the, here we have the
short-tailed weasel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing the guard here,
where the medulla shows a transition,
[SPEAKER_00]: where fibers widen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a deep, wavy S-curves here to the
medulla.
[SPEAKER_00]: The location where the medulla transition
has a wider section of hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do see that differentiation occurring
here in this guard cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind this is at 200 magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the short-tailed weasel,
the under-fur region, where we're also
[SPEAKER_00]: noticing some very different medulla
present here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just that source of comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at a woodchuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's one kind of nibbling on some
plant material there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the under-fur, we're seeing a
compilation of kind of hairs here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do see kind of quite the
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have unicellular lateral medulla.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a more complicated medulla.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we actually have no medulla due
to the intense pigmentation now present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keeping in mind where you're
sampling that hair or where that hair is
[SPEAKER_00]: being identified, it might require you to
look at different regions of the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual, but will help you potentially
identify where that hair sample may have
[SPEAKER_00]: come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the scales near the base here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the wide shape between the scale
margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fairly smooth scale margins here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these with a trained eye can allow
you to kind of get into some more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: details of comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have typically the diameter of the
hair to the medulla can help us define
[SPEAKER_00]: that medullary index.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, we also have the beaver here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a brown hair, that's great,
but we can see some differences between
[SPEAKER_00]: the beaver and the woodchuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while initially they look like brown
hair and even very similar organisms on a
[SPEAKER_00]: quick look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the hairs, we do see some
differences and it's important to be
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at those details.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're able to kind of classify what
was that hair from a beaver or hair from a
[SPEAKER_00]: woodchuck in the example provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the Arctic ground squirrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that kind of diameter to
medulla is a very common characteristic
[SPEAKER_00]: here that we use for comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also looking at the scale cast,
again, for that source of comparison and
[SPEAKER_00]: classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind, this is only a small
sample, but if this is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: interests you, you want to look at it into
some more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Alaska Fur ID project at alaskafurid
.wordpress.com is where a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: information was gathered, is a great
resource, has a lot of different animal
[SPEAKER_00]: pairs for comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's of interest of you,
I highly recommend you go about checking
[SPEAKER_00]: this resource out.
