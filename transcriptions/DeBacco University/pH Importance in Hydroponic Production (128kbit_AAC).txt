[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to be participating in
growing plants hydroponically,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be very familiar and
well-versed with pH and what it means and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep a close eye on monitoring and also
know how to adjust it.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH is the number one concern with any
operation, but it's especially the case
[SPEAKER_00]: with hydroponic setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's a lack of buffer factors,
it can result in quick changes in pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that it's a ten-fold increase
for every number, so if you're just two
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers off from where you want to be,
that's not just two places, that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred-fold difference in the hydrogen
ion concentrations, and that can largely
[SPEAKER_00]: affect and impact the nutrient
availability to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's a lack of buffer factors
that typically are more present in
[SPEAKER_00]: soil-based conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are transitioning from a soil-based
to a purely hydroponic base, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to realize that pure water has just about
no buffering capacities.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, the grower needs to keep a
close eye on this and keep a monitor and
[SPEAKER_00]: know how to adjust it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not let it get too far out of the
ideal range, because if it does,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will drastically impact the nutrient
availability to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also burn or kill the crop if a
grower's not careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
you you
