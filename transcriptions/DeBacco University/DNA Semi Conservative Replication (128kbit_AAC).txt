[SPEAKER_00]: DNA replication occurs in what we call a
semi-conservative method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to explore the details of
what does this actually mean, what's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually going on in the cells when DNA is
replicated in the semi-conservative
[SPEAKER_00]: replication method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's three possible methods for
replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's conservative, semi-conservative,
and then disruptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in conservative, the original DNA
molecule would be preserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that here where the parental
DNA is still present throughout the first
[SPEAKER_00]: replication and also the second
replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Semi-conservative, the daughter DNA
contains one old and one new strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here where original DNA,
the parental DNA, we have one old and one
[SPEAKER_00]: new, one old and one new, and that's
replicated throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then disruptive, where the old and new
strands are dispersed in daughter
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules kind of in this kind of random
kind of pattern here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the three possible methods for
replication, the one you really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on is this semi-conservative method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how's it kind of look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this kind of shows another rendition
with dark red and kind of a faint red of
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-conservative, where you still have
that one template strand, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: conservative, where that original strand
is left untouched, and then disruptive,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's different sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that conservative and
disruptive, these little asterisks,
[SPEAKER_00]: means they're found not to be biologically
significant, and it's this
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-conservative method that is the
process for DNA replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, evidence for semi-conservative
replication has been a lot of studies
[SPEAKER_00]: conducted to help prove this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have one where there's a
radioactive labeled nitrogen base,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're having this nitrogen and we're
going through and looking at different
[SPEAKER_00]: densities over different generations of E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see here that semi-conservative
is occurring because we have this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: blending that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this kind of loss in percent of
that original strand, that original
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a sense, in proving that, we have this
semi-conservative going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that original parental strand,
but we have these new strands going
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this look in another experiment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with any experiment, you're going to
have predictions, and these predictions
[SPEAKER_00]: here show that we have what a
conservative, semi-conservative,
[SPEAKER_00]: and disruptive would look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: For conservative, we would have that same
original strand present at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was proved not to be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: In disruptive, we have that parental
strand, but we'd have a continual mix of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those splicings of those daughter cells
doesn't occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This semi-conservativeness, we have that
original parental strand, but then we have
[SPEAKER_00]: that replication step where we're keeping
that parental strand, but we're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: new strands that are developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was found through that radioactively
labeling and allows scientists to depict
[SPEAKER_00]: where did specific molecules go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows them to trace them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This semi-conservativeness here,
where we're seeing that original strand
[SPEAKER_00]: all being this heavy medium, this low in
the test tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have this mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this light medium, it's medium
range kind of result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have, once we're making all of the
new strands, which is made of that lighter
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, we can see that blending of the
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot of those new strands being
that lighter component, but we still have
[SPEAKER_00]: that mixture of those original parental
strands for that first generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those replication options, again,
as it shows, same kind of process here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Semi-conservative, you have those one dark
strand and one yellow strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disruptive, there'd be all little
different pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: In conservative, that dark strand would
stay the same and you'd only have new
[SPEAKER_00]: strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does DNA copy itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's using that original base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our double helix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're separating it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's using that original base as a
template, which is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's able to use that template,
it really reduces the chance of any errors
[SPEAKER_00]: being made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, DNA copying, each cell division must
copy the entire DNA sequence, so each
[SPEAKER_00]: other cell gets a complete copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the rate of synthesis is very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of gives you that rendition here
of seeing just how quick it can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: In bacteria, they can do about 1,000 bases
per second, and in mammals, only about 100
[SPEAKER_00]: bases per second, but still a very quick
overall run through here, because we see
[SPEAKER_00]: how quickly we can replicate those DNA
strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the problem with a single replication
origin is that a bacterial genome is four
[SPEAKER_00]: times 10 to the sixth power.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes about only 20 minutes to copy,
and we see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Human genome, if we had that single point
of replication, because it's so much
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger, would take 10,000 times longer,
which would be basically biologically just
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, human genomes, many
eukaryotes, have these replication
[SPEAKER_00]: bubbles, or these multiple points along
the DNA for replication to occur,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just one single site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the copying solutions region is an
AT, that's an adenine and diamine rich
[SPEAKER_00]: that allow easy separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, those only have two hydrogen
bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eukaryotes have multiple replication
origins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans can have like 10,000 origin points,
and eventually, these will all meet,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into our newly synthesized DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really helps reduce the time for this to
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The copying solutions, a double helix to
be copied, is through
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-conservativeness, which basically
means one, our double strand, one's being
[SPEAKER_00]: used as a template strand, and the other
one is the new replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each daughter cell gets one of the
original copies, and then one of the new
[SPEAKER_00]: copies to help reduce the chance for
errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unwinding at one point is used at the
replication site, and in humans and
[SPEAKER_00]: eukaryotes with long genomes, there'll be
multiple replication sites, but they will
[SPEAKER_00]: all follow this semi-conservative
replication method.
