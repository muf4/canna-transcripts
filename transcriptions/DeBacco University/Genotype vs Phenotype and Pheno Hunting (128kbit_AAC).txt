[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be looking at genotype
versus phenotype, and how understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: this difference will relate to this term
called phenohunting, which is often used
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genotype is the genetics of the
organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's referring to the actual DNA sequence,
the actual double-stranded DNA sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to say what it looks like,
because that's phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genotype are the actual genetics of that
organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenotype is the observable
characteristics of that organism,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it can be the result of interaction
with the genotype and the surrounding
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phenotype is how it physically looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genotype is referring to the actual
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get to this term phenohunting,
but it's short for phenotype hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is referred to as searching for a
particular plant that is demonstrating a
[SPEAKER_00]: desirable trait out of a large population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a large population here,
high degree of genetics, high degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: looks, and we go through the process of
selecting for certain genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenotypes, certain characteristics that
we see in a particular plant and want to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed that particular trait further and
replicate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phenohunting or cloning or tissue
culture could also be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have the chosen individual,
this will ensure that multiple plants
[SPEAKER_00]: exhibit that desired trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we phenohunt, we find that one
that we're really interested in,
[SPEAKER_00]: we then will clone that particular one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like a copy machine, here we see two
duplicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, this material can be used
for breeding to help increase the odds of
[SPEAKER_00]: transferring one trait and combining it
with another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when certain types, some people will
phenotype certain males looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are times that phenotype hunting is
for females, particular plant morphology
[SPEAKER_00]: or particular aromas produced or something
unique or different.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, one word of caution with
phenohunting is looks can be deceiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you're selecting traits based on
phenotypes, this may result potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: for high degree of variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though two things may look the
same, looks can be deceiving, as we see
[SPEAKER_00]: here with the leading tower of Pisa,
kind of forced perspective there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because two traits may look alike or we
may see something that looks like what we
[SPEAKER_00]: want, that can be sometimes deceiving when
we go through and propagate it or breed it
[SPEAKER_00]: further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an example of this when phenohunting
goes wrong, there is a time when breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: were looking to improve bonsai plant
diversity and the search was on to find a
[SPEAKER_00]: new bonsai plant, a new small dwarf plant
for container gardening, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people thought they hit the jackpot
when they went to the beach because there
[SPEAKER_00]: are many trees that are bonsai size
despite being very old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were able to determine they had a
lunch of these older tree species that
[SPEAKER_00]: were very small and be very conducive to a
container garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want a tree that's going to
grow full size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of breeders took these plants and
thought they kind of hit the jackpot there
[SPEAKER_00]: with finding varieties that were,
for whatever reason, old but still very
[SPEAKER_00]: small.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall was when these plants were
brought into greenhouses to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: propagate, they began to show normal plant
behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was actually happening is all at
the beach where salt water and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: stress, winds, poor soils, this was
actually stunting the trees, giving them a
[SPEAKER_00]: bonsai phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though they had the genotype to grow
to full size trees and they were brought
[SPEAKER_00]: in the greenhouse for propagation,
they were given a better environment and
[SPEAKER_00]: they started growing more normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is just a word of caution
that phenohunting can go wrong because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're basing it on the simple how a plant
looks and not based necessarily off the
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genotype and phenotype can sometimes
differ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for your attention.
Thank you.
