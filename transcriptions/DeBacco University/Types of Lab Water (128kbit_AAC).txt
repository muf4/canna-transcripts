[SPEAKER_00]: Now you may not realize it, but there's
actually different types of lab water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we might just think water is all the
same H2O.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's not necessarily the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like some people aren't familiar with
these different types or grades of nickel
[SPEAKER_00]: syrup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when would we use these different types
of lab water?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to explain here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these different types of lab water are
referring to different levels of purity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher levels of purity are needed for
very sensitive techniques where
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminants could negatively impact the
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these higher levels of purity we want
to be using on experiments and protocols
[SPEAKER_00]: will call for these when we're using
equipment that has high degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not just use the highest purity all
the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, simply put, it's because of cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does cost a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's not needed in the majority of
cases, so it would be a waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be sure that you're using
the purity for the sensitivity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have the highest sensitive
equipment, you can use a lower grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot less expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to get the same end
result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So type one is ultra-pure water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the purest grade of lab water
there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used for highly critical
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mass spec is one that really requires this
ultra-pure water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing trace element analysis,
that can be another one because if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: trace elements in that water, those are
going to negatively influence the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using RNAase and DNAase-free water.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're looking at is pure water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have any way that it's going to
break down or mess with DNA studies that
[SPEAKER_00]: you might be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't break down any of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these are ultra-pure water,
type one, the highest grade of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very expensive as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure water, type two, recommended source
for ultra-pure systems, typically used for
[SPEAKER_00]: buffers, microbiology, media prep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not quite type one, but used in areas
where microbiology, we don't want to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: other microbiology organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at using something that is a
source of water and it's less expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: than the type one and often used in these
particular cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type three is instrument fed or feed
water, I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's produced using RO water, reverse
osmosis or the distillation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most commonly used water grades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type three is the most common.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, it's typically fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glassware washers can use this humidity
chambers, autoclaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these can typically require distilled
water or reverse osmosis water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silt can be used at such a high degree
that in some labs will be distilled water
[SPEAKER_00]: on tap, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a large tank or a kind of a
plumbing system that allows a separate
[SPEAKER_00]: faucet to be used to get that water,
simply because this is a clean water
[SPEAKER_00]: source and used in many experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, tap water, as this name implies,
it comes directly from the faucet for tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often contains minerals, easiest to get
and least expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the procedure only states water,
this is the type that's assumed simply
[SPEAKER_00]: because the small amounts of other
minerals or particulates that might be in
[SPEAKER_00]: there aren't considered to be at levels
that will impact the results of the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it says add water, you can probably get
away with just tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, it will specify the type of
water that's required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this didn't complicate things
too much and developed a better
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of the fact that there are
different grades of lab water and where
[SPEAKER_00]: they need to be used.
Thank you.
