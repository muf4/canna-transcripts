[SPEAKER_00]: So when many people hear cannabis in the
production of cannabis, they're thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the plant and needing to be a
botanist or a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we can't forget about the fact
that getting into cannabis and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, as well as some of the
fertilizer regimens, the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: having a chemist involved in the
production of cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this DeBacco University video,
we're going to get into the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: a cannabis chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're considering getting into the
cannabis industry and you're interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry, there may be a job for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at some of those
aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the job description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a chemist or scientist is
responsible for devising, creating and
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing new product formulations,
as well as manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemists find ways to increase the
efficiency of the extraction methods used,
[SPEAKER_00]: within the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: They send test samples to third-party
companies and use the information from
[SPEAKER_00]: them to further improve upon the system in
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the chemist of that is trying to
extract those certain cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to understand how those molecules
behave to be able to increase the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency of the extraction process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the day-to-day activities of a chemist
that is specialized in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to optimize the recovery of all
extractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to optimize the speed of the
extractions as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can produce the same thing in a
shorter period of time, well, that allows
[SPEAKER_00]: for increased efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your responsibility is to oversee the
efficiency as well as the purification of
[SPEAKER_00]: the processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's responsible for the production of
new formulations as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They coordinate with third-party
laboratories to send them samples and get
[SPEAKER_00]: those results back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They maintain strict levels of accuracy
and they interpret testing results.
[SPEAKER_00]: They track records, inventory as
product-related supplies as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very important to keep track of
that and document all of these processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they follow appropriate regulations
which might be changing and updating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important for them to stay current
with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're responsible for laboratory
functions as well as production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now qualities, if you're considering to
pursue this job would mean you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: have some of these basic qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowledge in the operations of rotary
evaporator, spray dryer, fluid extractor,
[SPEAKER_00]: as other cannabis-related lab equipment,
particularly involved in the extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Standardization and calibration of the
analytical equipment as well is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important because you want to make sure
you're getting accurate results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Must have a science degree as well as some
laboratory experience typically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Must be at least 21 years old and
willingness to participate with others
[SPEAKER_00]: because often you're working in a
cooperative environment of a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's the connection to the cannabis
industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, at least, cannabis chemists
are constantly discovering new methods of
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction as well as products and
information about how the brain and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can work closely with kind of other
research scientists taking an extract and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing how it performs in other
situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the methods used today for
extraction were devised by chemists in the
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, prior to the domestication of
cannabis for medicinal purposes and have
[SPEAKER_00]: since been adapted to use in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then these chemists are taking it the next
step further in refining that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this is of interest to you,
you may want to consider to be a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: chemist.
Thank you.
