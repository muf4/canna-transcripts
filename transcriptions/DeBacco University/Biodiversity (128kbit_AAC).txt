[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, we're going to go over
biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the two images that I put here,
you can see here in the wildflowers area
[SPEAKER_00]: on the offside of the hayfield,
a great amount of biodiversity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in the hayfield here, a minimum
amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, a picture of a bunch of mushrooms
indicating the biodiversity that can occur
[SPEAKER_00]: in a relatively small area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, biodiversity is simply defined as the
variety of life in a habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the same two images here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use two terms here, species richness,
and that's referring to the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: species in an ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This biologically diverse ecosystems are
generally more stable than simple ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: These diverse areas allow different
species to be able to match the particular
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions that may occur, allows life to
continue to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its quality is usually measured,
what we call this biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many different species live in this
particular habitat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two important factors in promoting
biodiversity, one is ecosystem size.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may make sense in the simple fact
that the larger the ecosystem contains
[SPEAKER_00]: more diverse habitats and therefore has
greater number of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: A reduction in the ecosystem size will
simply reduce the amount of species that
[SPEAKER_00]: it can support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can ultimately lead to extinction may
occur in extreme cases if the ecosystem
[SPEAKER_00]: shrinks too small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example, a picture of the world
here with certain amount of biomes defined
[SPEAKER_00]: as different regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna go over biomes in a different
section.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a project related to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Latitude is another important factor when
determining biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of species in the tropics is
far more than the Arctic regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply because it's a longer growing
season, plants can survive longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are constantly growing,
allowing animals to eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The climate tends to be more stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: These dark red regions represent greater
biodiversity and these deeper blues to
[SPEAKER_00]: black regions represent less biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in general, towards the
equator regions, there tends to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiversity than at either pole.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is simply because a longer growing
season and more stable conditions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically looking at what we call
island biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we're getting an equilibrium
model and we're gonna look at an isolated
[SPEAKER_00]: island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the species richness on an island
is dynamic, equilibrium between
[SPEAKER_00]: colonization and rate of extinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here we have a bunch of
different birds, a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: beaks, various items that they eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a generalist insect catching.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some nectar feeding, surface
swimming, filter feeders, so on and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have to develop certain niches to
be able to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two important factors looking at island
biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is island size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our mainland, here's our radiating
points outward.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larger the island, in this case island
number two, will tend to have more species
[SPEAKER_00]: than smaller ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should seem logical.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's larger, there should be more apt
to have greater diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greater number of species can survive
there versus the small little island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here again, distance from the mainland.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case we're gonna call island one
and two are basically the same size for
[SPEAKER_00]: intents and purposes with the same
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the distance from the mainland
can impact this.
[SPEAKER_00]: These that are closer to the mainland will
have greater biodiversity than those
[SPEAKER_00]: further away.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is simply like you, you don't want to
travel very far.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna jump to the closest area
before making a long distance trip to this
[SPEAKER_00]: island.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of energy to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tend to be kind of a close area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're parking in a parking lot,
tend to pick the closest spot,
[SPEAKER_00]: very near.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to go to these distant
areas here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gonna tend to be less biodiverse
further away from that mainland.
[SPEAKER_00]: This again shows a little bit of a graph
indicating our number of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being far away are gonna have less species
than islands closer to the mainland or
[SPEAKER_00]: near mainland.
[SPEAKER_00]: This distance effect is what that relates
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farther away, less species, nearer to the
mainland, more species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at large and small
islands and the smaller island someplace
[SPEAKER_00]: with less species and the larger island
has more species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting that in a little bit different
color here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at our island biodiversity
summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing here, fewer species on small
distant islands and more species on large
[SPEAKER_00]: nearby islands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, when we say nearby islands,
nearby to the mainland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is on the x-axis here,
increasing species richness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these many species and these are fewer
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those on large islands close to the
mainland tend to have greater biodiversity
[SPEAKER_00]: than those smaller islands that are far
away.
So that's what we're looking at here.
So that's what we're looking at here.
