[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at the
basic organization of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with the most simple atomic scale
and working our all the way off throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the different stages and levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting at the atom level.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's considered the most basic
organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those atoms kind of come together to form
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case we have oxygen alone forming
the molecule dioxide or oxygen here found
[SPEAKER_00]: in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxygen and other molecules can combine to
form macromolecules which we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: spend an entire unit on macromolecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: These macromolecules such as the
phospholipid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the phospholipid bilayer and that's a
component of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have the cell which is again
composed of atoms which form together to
[SPEAKER_00]: make molecules which make macromolecules
or big molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those then come together to make cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cells though we continue on to tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a combined organization of cells from
tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those tissues can then combine to form an
organ such as the lung.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then have an organ system such as the
respiratory system here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those organ systems can then make an
organism such as the lion here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has respiratory, digestive,
reproductive system and many more that
[SPEAKER_00]: come together to make the organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the organism though we can continue
on to a population where we have multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: lions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a population we go to a community
where we have lions and zebras.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from a community we build on to an
ecosystem for tacking in the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: and that can ultimately lead here to the
biosphere which is life on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to focus on different units
throughout this entire biology unit on
[SPEAKER_00]: populations, communities, ecosystems and
also touch on the biosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now life is an emergent property.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does it mean being an emergent
property?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well emergent properties are basically the
consequence of structural organization
[SPEAKER_00]: that is the hallmark of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are characterized by many aspects of
the living world.
[SPEAKER_00]: In each higher level organization contains
novel properties not present in simpler
[SPEAKER_00]: level of organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is this kind of like?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this relate or mean to the
pictures I put here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we have the picture of the brain
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go into all the details
of it here but a single neuron cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: perform the function that the brain does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like a single bird here cannot
perform the function of the entire flock.
[SPEAKER_00]: When neurons are all working together as a
functional brain that is where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: having that emergent property when no
single neuron can perform this task.
[SPEAKER_00]: No single bird can perform the task of the
flock but here you have a collection all
[SPEAKER_00]: working together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of an emergent property
that gets back to the organization of life.
