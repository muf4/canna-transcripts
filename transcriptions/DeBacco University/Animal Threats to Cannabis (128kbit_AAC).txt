[SPEAKER_00]: So when we think of threats to cannabis
plants, we may think of mainly the
[SPEAKER_00]: microscopic and very small threats.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't forget about the larger animal
threats to cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So animal threats may be of greater
concern for outdoor operations,
[SPEAKER_00]: but mice can be a problem with indoor
grows as well as outdoor grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now while we have a bunch of animals here
pictured, odds are starfish and jellyfish
[SPEAKER_00]: are probably not high on the threats to
cannabis, but others definitely are.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, threats from above.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to watch out for birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can attack particularly newly planted
seedlings outdoors, and particular crows
[SPEAKER_00]: can be very destructive in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turkeys can also be a problem if you have
a recently tilled field with all this
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to go into that recently
prepared field and dust themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can walk across plastic if you're
using that for weed control and do damage
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be mindful and keep an eye out for
turkeys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Larger animals such as deer and bears,
well, bears are an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry is not much you can really do
because they're large, powerful organisms
[SPEAKER_00]: that can easily tear down fences and do a
whole host of damage onto your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deer, though, make things called deer
fence, and they can potentially do some
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding damage, but also physical plant
damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deer fence is the best method of control,
but be careful to ensure that the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: is well secured.
[SPEAKER_00]: We typically think of deer jumping over
fence, but they also like to try and crawl
[SPEAKER_00]: under the fence to make sure that the
bottom is secured very well as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fence should be about 8 to 12 feet
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cheat, as I said, by having the
fence shorter, but using poles that are
[SPEAKER_00]: the full kind of 12, 10 feet or so tall
there, because deer will run up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: fence, and they'll look up, and they kind
of look for the tops of the poles,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that can be one way you can try to
cheat and use a shorter fence,
[SPEAKER_00]: because fence can be expensive,
and try to get the same effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: preventing deer from entering your grow
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fence from below, the gophers and
woodchucks, I think Puxa Tony Phil here on
[SPEAKER_00]: Groundhog Day, these are animals that
burrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be a challenge because they dig
holes in tunnels that can go under fences,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they can also be very destructive in a
very short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can sometimes bury fences to try to
eliminate them from going over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say under and burn the tunnels,
but they can be, again, very destructive
[SPEAKER_00]: in those regards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Threats that are small, so mice and voles
are examples of very small animals that
[SPEAKER_00]: can cause a large damage to an animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: For mice, watch for plants as much as the
seeds you're storing, and also going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you go through and plant a bunch
of seeds, and mice can come through and
[SPEAKER_00]: burrow and dig up, and just kind of plant
the soil and cause all sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: germination as a challenge is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cats can be a very effective method for
control to kind of keep mice away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of having them set up in the
have-a-heart traps is another way,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just be mindful, especially starting
in the spring or in the fall, when you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a heat source, they easily can find
that and be very destructive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, keep your seeds stored in sealed
containers so that mice don't go in and
[SPEAKER_00]: mess those up either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Threats from grazers, squirrels,
and chipmunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Squirrels can be curious and cause random
and frustrating damage at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also be very difficult to
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electric fence can help with squirrels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small have-a-heart traps with chipmunks
with peanut butter as bait is a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: help control them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very fast moving, and again,
can burrow and dig and top plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, again, not welcomed in any
growth area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, rabbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rabbits may be numerous around plants,
but often do little or no damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you have a threat with a
question mark here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These odds are, while they may be around,
the odds of them doing really severe
[SPEAKER_00]: damage are quite low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, don't think you have to
eliminate everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, this could be an animal you
could potentially tolerate due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: threat of it causing damage is very low.
Thank you.
