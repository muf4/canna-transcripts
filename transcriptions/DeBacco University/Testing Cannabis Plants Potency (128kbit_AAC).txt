[SPEAKER_00]: Now on this tobacco university video we're
going to go over some testing cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants potency and kind of looking at the
debate whether we should be providing a
[SPEAKER_00]: number or a range when we're looking at
potency related to cannabis Now it is
[SPEAKER_00]: important to test cannabis for its potency
We're looking at more of an analytical
[SPEAKER_00]: report than kind of this kind of
coloration difference because it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to determine well is this uh
where does this exactly fall what
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage so we're going to look at this
in more detail however looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: general trends of potency of cannabis
samples percentage THC and CBD and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis samples seized by the DA from
1995 to 2019 and we can see that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: generally a trend of an increase in THC
and overall generally a decrease here in
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD percentage of those seized by the DA
from environmental agencies now when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the percentages here these are
ones that are seized on the street we are
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing some of course medical benefits
from the CBD but the fact that it may lack
[SPEAKER_00]: that psychoactive high may make it less of
a street desirable end product so looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at this research article here and again
brief summary will only be provided but
[SPEAKER_00]: the role of nasa spec looking at the
cannabis industry to get some of this
[SPEAKER_00]: detail of testing so there's five
cannabinoids here presented and in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis potency typically refers to the
percentage of THC and or the CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol in the plant material however
at least three other cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_00]: routinely monitored including THCA CBDA
and CBN so just remember that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: more than just the THC and the CBD that
tends to get a lot of the highlight or the
[SPEAKER_00]: attention so companies may offer many
tests actually this is a good thing while
[SPEAKER_00]: the main interest is typically the
cannabinoids in terms remember the
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminant testing is required and the
product needs to pass all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: categories as well so I'm just caught up
in looking at THC CBD and cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some terpenes we're also looking at
kind of passing all of the contaminant
[SPEAKER_00]: testing such as heavy metal testing
mycotoxin testing microbial analysis and
[SPEAKER_00]: so on also when we're looking at
cannabinoids it's more than just THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD there's a list here so what some
companies will test for so it's good to
[SPEAKER_00]: have that full kind of understanding of
all the cannabinoids present in that final
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material now sample size does vary
so depending on what end product is being
[SPEAKER_00]: tested will require a different amount of
a minimum sample keep in mind that the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of tests performed should correlate
with the size total lot size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product produced for example while two
grams of plant material is required if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're harvesting 10 plants versus a
thousand plants there should be a
[SPEAKER_00]: different number of samples even though
each sample only requires two grams here's
[SPEAKER_00]: something provided with some general
guidelines from companies waters and
[SPEAKER_00]: drinks should be looking at 10 milliliters
or provide the full finished product for
[SPEAKER_00]: determining the fill weight on analytical
scale plant material looking at about two
[SPEAKER_00]: grams concentrates only need about one
gram infused products about four units of
[SPEAKER_00]: those infused products just to give you an
idea of the sample size with the different
[SPEAKER_00]: testing that occurs now the testing
instruments high performance liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatography or HPLC with diode ray
detection allows us to determine run
[SPEAKER_00]: spectral analysis for confirmed end
results good to know what your lab is
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing for testing equipment to
generate those important numbers on the
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical report now there are testing
compliance standards testing laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: should meet gmp standards glp standards
and FDA compliant pharma practices this is
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of looking at good manufacturing
practices good labor practices and meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: those pharmaceutical standards all other
additional things to be looking for if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're especially comparing or looking at
determining what lab you want to get your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material tested at so there's a
great debate here should the test results
[SPEAKER_00]: be expressed as a number or a range for
example asking what is your age and
[SPEAKER_00]: providing it with how many years old you
are or what is your age based on you know
[SPEAKER_00]: general ranges here this is a great debate
in the cannabis industry should be looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at quoting an exact number or should be
cutting the potency in a range so if we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at kind of looking at expressed as
a single number the advantage is that it
[SPEAKER_00]: is just an exact single numbers we see
here thirty eight point six one percent
[SPEAKER_00]: this is known with certainty so that's a
great thing however the disadvantages is
[SPEAKER_00]: really to get that known number that
precise number it does require a
[SPEAKER_00]: homogenized sample so this cannot be done
with just a single dry flower it has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: sold as kind of that homogenized sample so
with that homogenized sample you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: just test one single dry flower you have
to take multiple dry flowers cut them all
[SPEAKER_00]: up kind of get a kind of a mixture of that
and then test that to get that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: exact number because different flowers as
you know we're going to have slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: different variables thing where they're
located on the plant and just inherent
[SPEAKER_00]: invariability of that harvest now when
we're looking at a range the advantage of
[SPEAKER_00]: having the range expressed is that it
gives you the expected range to from that
[SPEAKER_00]: product can be formed as a lot of a dry
flower harvest we're testing multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers you can say oh the lowest flower
was here the highest flower is here so the
[SPEAKER_00]: expected range of this harvest lot would
be this the disadvantage is it does not
[SPEAKER_00]: give a single fixed number due to the
variability and it's harder for regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: agencies to handle this pharmaceutical
grade material that have one request a
[SPEAKER_00]: number and not a range so it's important
to realize that we are dealing with plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material and it's expected to have some
variability looking at different tomatoes
[SPEAKER_00]: or apples there's gonna be different
variability from one to another hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: that range will be very small but it's
very hard to pinpoint an exact number this
[SPEAKER_00]: is kind of the great debate should it be
expressed as a range or a number whichever
[SPEAKER_00]: one you agree with when you feel that
should be the accepted put on a label
[SPEAKER_00]: there are different videos here so you can
explore the advantages and kind of more
[SPEAKER_00]: details of the range kind of produce
production of the analytical report or you
[SPEAKER_00]: could explore another video that will look
at the number as far as provided on an
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical report hopefully this provides
you with some good information and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: this comparison that you may not have
thought of to again help improve your
[SPEAKER_00]: education regarding cannabis at all stages
including growing as well as the end
[SPEAKER_00]: product and testing all provided here on
