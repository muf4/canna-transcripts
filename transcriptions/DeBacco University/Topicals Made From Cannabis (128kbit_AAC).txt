[SPEAKER_00]: Now another cannabis end product that you
may have heard of are topicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here in this Tobacco University video,
we're going to go over some of the details
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with topicals that are made
from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go through some topicals
that are made from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the products mentioned here
are going to be kind of highlighted from
[SPEAKER_00]: CT Pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they provide great publicly
available analytical reports and labels of
[SPEAKER_00]: the products that they do produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, the descriptions,
opinions, and uses are intended to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: an understanding of some of the end
products of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those analytical reports, which will
be an example of one provided at the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: are important and often missed component
that should accompany any product someone
[SPEAKER_00]: is interested in purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, just a description of
topicals in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So topicals are a variety of lotions,
creams infused with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be directly applied and absorbed
to the skin for medical relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different topical options.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just some of the examples
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you looked at some other videos,
you'll notice the strength of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: topicals is listed as medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the concentrates are listed as
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind that when you're
looking at different options at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: products of cannabis, some categories are
going to just in general have higher
[SPEAKER_00]: strengths, more medium or lower strengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, know what effects you're looking
for and what benefits you're looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: and search out that category of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the use of topicals, as I said,
they can be applied, massaged directly
[SPEAKER_00]: into the skin, can be absorbed for a
medium strength localized relief of pain
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another option there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're talking about our topicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like anything produced from the
cannabis plant, we want to be mindful of
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at some of the analytical reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at more than just the
cannabinoids, looking at more than just
[SPEAKER_00]: the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also making sure they're passing microbial
counts, yeast or mold counts, chloroform
[SPEAKER_00]: counts, E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli, many different things here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need to be mindful of making sure
our products are passing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making sure we have the dates,
current dates, lot numbers tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, a lot of times this will appear
on the label and that's a good thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're right as a consumer to look at
the label and also access or have the
[SPEAKER_00]: right to accessing those actual reports
there as we saw previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Label is a great summary, but having an
actual report just ensures do you know
[SPEAKER_00]: where it was tested or when it was tested
and make sure the lot numbers match.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is part of you just being an
informed consumer.
