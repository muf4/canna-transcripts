[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to be showing you two
ways you can protect your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is going to be insect netting,
and one of them is going to be reflective
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So insect netting, I think it's going to
be a wave of the future because it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: only item that will work 100% assuming
it's installed properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This physical barrier between the insects
and the plants eliminate the need for any
[SPEAKER_00]: applications on the leaves, and this also
works 24 hours a day whether it's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: rainy spring or whether it's a very dry
spring, you have to keep applying
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Works great in raised bed situations as we
see here, and also in long field
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now insect netting, there's different mesh
sizes to control certain insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the finer mesh sizes are advised if
we're trying to control really small
[SPEAKER_00]: things like aphids would be an example,
and larger, typically less expensive,
[SPEAKER_00]: larger mesh sizes can be used for larger
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what insect you're
specifically trying to control,
[SPEAKER_00]: will determine what insect netting you
purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's more than just a crop cover,
it's also highly recommended to install in
[SPEAKER_00]: your season extenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example your high tunnels,
doorways in and out, venting sides,
[SPEAKER_00]: fans, anything that you have in
greenhouses, this should be all covered
[SPEAKER_00]: with insect netting, maintaining that
physical separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to put it on a door,
don't make it in a hinge door because it
[SPEAKER_00]: can get stuck open or be left open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have some way that you can have to lift
maybe a portion of the net to get in and
[SPEAKER_00]: so it self closes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This physical barrier is not a new idea,
so while it's being newly applied for
[SPEAKER_00]: insects, bird netting on grapes is very
common to keep birds out from picking away
[SPEAKER_00]: at all the wonderful grapes before they're
harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I wanted to mention for
protecting your plants would be reflective
[SPEAKER_00]: mulches.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be silver plastic reflects
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the same as gray plastic,
so I had to farm right into that issue
[SPEAKER_00]: where you want the silver, the shiny,
the chrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you apply it, you might be sure you
wear sunglasses even on cloudy days
[SPEAKER_00]: because it does reflect the sun and it is
quite bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to confuse, so how do these
work?
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to confuse insects so they
cannot tell where the protective underside
[SPEAKER_00]: of the leaf is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great for thrips, which are a common
pest on onions we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though this is not 100% all
reflective, there's that black strip
[SPEAKER_00]: running down the center, it's still
advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though reflective mulches may not
be 100% effective, if you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: apply a plastic kind of barrier here for
weed suppression, it's worth a
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration because it can aid in
reducing, especially when plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: small, at reducing the chance of thrift
pressure on onions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
