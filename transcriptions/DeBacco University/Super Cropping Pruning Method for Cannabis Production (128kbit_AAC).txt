[SPEAKER_00]: Interested in learning more about
supercropping your cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this DeBaco University video will
give you some details if you're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: learning more about this pruning method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into supercropping pruning
method for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the quick and simple of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, supercropping can be a quick and
simple way to prune train plants to run if
[SPEAKER_00]: they run out of height in the growing
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like when you're getting
that area of getting too close to the
[SPEAKER_00]: area, the roof or the ceiling limited or
lights, you can super crop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a technique where you're bending the
stem close to a 90 degree angle that
[SPEAKER_00]: involves breaking the internal fibers of
the plant in the process, but not breaking
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire top off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be done in flower, although it's
usually performed in the vegetative stage
[SPEAKER_00]: of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I say this kind of bending here,
it looks pretty aggressive and it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're not breaking this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not completely falling off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This top part will continue to be able to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, because of that, because you don't
want to break that plant off, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn the feel of the plant, squeezing,
pinching the stem where you want to bend
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will feel the plant's tissue start to
crush a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you want to lay the upper part of
the branch over at a right angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goal is to crush but not break
the plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not perform this on the top two to
three nodes as you want to be sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is some plant material above to
crush the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it when it's too young,
you won't have any of those really kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: developed fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: With thinner or woodier stems that are
harder to crush, but it is possible if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to learn a little bit more
of that technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just comes with some feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stem eventually will form a callus or
kind of swell at that bending point after
[SPEAKER_00]: a period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the advantages of supercropping,
why would someone want to be implementing
[SPEAKER_00]: this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the most obvious reason is to keep
the plant canopy at the same level,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in height limited growing
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bending of the main stem will also
increase light exposure to lower buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can help increase the number of
larger buds the plant produces.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these are good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where that timing comes in and
learning your particular strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that this does not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wealth plants have been aggressively
lollipopped as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can sometimes combine pruning
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're supercropping and lollipopping,
those two are really kind of a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more of a conflict to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, supercropping can help maximize
the horizontal space in the growing area
[SPEAKER_00]: and fill in empty gaps, both between
plants and also within the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about having multiple tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just one example here of a plant
that counted 59 different tops there from
[SPEAKER_00]: a single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a great method to kind of
implement there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can just see how many tops we can get
from one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when do you actually super crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: When's the kind of the perfect timing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's typically performed in early
flower or so, as this could increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of the bud and the end branches and
also lower buds that will now be getting
[SPEAKER_00]: greater light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some do it in the late veg, some early
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's not like a set day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general recommendation, though,
is about three to seven days a week before
[SPEAKER_00]: growers decide to flip that photo period
to help allow plants some time to recover
[SPEAKER_00]: from the stress of this method before they
go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some growers will do it right after
they flip in the flower to give them a
[SPEAKER_00]: little time to adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other growers like to do it just before
they flip in the flower to allow some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that longer photo period to penetrate the
canopy and encourage those buds to start
[SPEAKER_00]: forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the basic process of super cropping
is to make room for more super cropping in
[SPEAKER_00]: some examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be done multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: This example here, the branch is bent that
has no lower branches growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have an initial bending point
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that allow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we take that branch and bend it
this way now, this makes room now for this
[SPEAKER_00]: branch now be bent going this way to fill
in that empty space.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows for a different branch that
does not have lower branches to be moved
[SPEAKER_00]: into this area and this is how you can
really maximize production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at your plant and kind of like,
okay, if I take this one, I kind of bend
[SPEAKER_00]: this one outward going this way now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now it gives me an empty space here
that maybe I take one that's over here and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of bend it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're starting to maximize that canopy
from still a single plant, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: important if you're ceiling height limited
or also if you're plant number limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's happening when you're super
cropping?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a plant hormone shift that's
occurring and the bending of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: does not remove the apical portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant, but it does increase the light
intensity to the inner and also the lower
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can help induce further development
of these lower portions of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without this pruning style in this area,
these leaves would be shaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're maximizing the light penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're maximizing the coverage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really allowing the plants to
perform and to produce the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage or greatest efficiency that we
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why growers like to utilize
this pruning method.
