[SPEAKER_00]: You may hear some people say, oh,
I've got hard water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to try to shed some light
on what that actually means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say what it doesn't mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean ice or ice fishing,
fishing in the hard water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard water has to refer to water here that
contains a lot of minerals in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can present some challenges to
people in piping systems here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hard water is water that contains
elevated levels of calcium and magnesium,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically above 150 milligrams of calcium
carbonate per liter, that have limestone
[SPEAKER_00]: deposits can be located in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what hard water forms when water
passes through these limestone deposits,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you typically would be in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of the unscientific way to test for
hard water, we identified water that will
[SPEAKER_00]: not allow soap to form bubbles when mixed
or added.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because of the high levels of
calcium magnesium that it contains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can damage metal fittings.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running an irrigation system,
it can cause some issues with fittings
[SPEAKER_00]: that you may have over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also result in buildup or
calcification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we can see the outline of a pipe
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see the layers that it build up
and how small the diameter is of this
[SPEAKER_00]: pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that you have all this buildup in
here, this is also reducing your flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can be important if you're
looking at maximizing movement of water
[SPEAKER_00]: and planning out an irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can severely restrict it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can cause issues in the total volume
that you're getting to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard water can also have high sodium
levels, which can lead to nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorine is needed by the plants,
but only in small quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it like a small pinch of salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be adding spoonfuls of
salt here because it can really mess with
[SPEAKER_00]: the cation exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while chlorine is needed, it's not
needed in very high amounts in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: High amounts can damage plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now lastly, watch for high levels of
chlorine in our clorinamide, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: since this can kill beneficial microbes
that you may be trying to add or trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: propagate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at hard water or
sometimes treatment of that, if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: high levels of chlorine, you can be
damaging microbes that you're directly
[SPEAKER_00]: adding to your water before you even apply
it to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you're considering using
organic compost teas or other microbe
[SPEAKER_00]: additions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might keep a plate nice and sterile,
but if you're adding, with the intention
[SPEAKER_00]: of adding these microbes, you add it to
water that contains high levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorine or these other sterilants,
you can be basically killing the good
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes that you're trying to add.
