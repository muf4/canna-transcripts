[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at some
very specific classifications of hormones
[SPEAKER_00]: in a little bit more detail on how the
different classifications of these
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones have different ways of entering
and affecting cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting first, hormones in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a hormone is a chemical signal
that's produced in one part of the body
[SPEAKER_00]: and acts at a distant site.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three main advantages to the body
to using these chemical signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is it can spread to all tissues via
the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anywhere blood goes, which is
throughout the entire body, these hormones
[SPEAKER_00]: can travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, they can persist much longer
than electrical signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electrical signals, for example,
would be in our nervous system,
[SPEAKER_00]: which also causes effects all over the
body, but for a very short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hormones persist much longer in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can act as, maybe act as hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking here, these chemical
signals, right, they're acting,
[SPEAKER_00]: an example would be as hormones,
which we're going to investigate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, different hormones can target
different tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important because what is
secreted into the bloodstream will only
[SPEAKER_00]: affect target cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to affect all cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only going to affect target cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I have the image here is
these hormones create a balance that needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times there's a lot of
stresses on the body and hormones need to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain this balance or homeostasis on a
daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how this is occurring is hormones
need receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see a signal, we see a receptor,
and we have an effect that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, here's a hormone entering the
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one molecule is causing this
cascading of effect, which is then
[SPEAKER_00]: resulting in a ribosome producing a
protein, which is changing the cell's
[SPEAKER_00]: function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one little hormone can cause a bunch of
different steps to occur that ultimately,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, cause a change in the cell
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's homology in hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this tell you about the
hormone prolapse?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have prolactin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It affects mammals and birds and fish and
amphibians.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's related to kind of a growth hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does this hormone produce different
effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as we see here, it's involved with
milk production with animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: For birds, it's fat metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: For fish, it's salt and water balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: For amphibians, it's metamorphosis and
maturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this kind of leads us to believe
that this suggests that prolactin is an
[SPEAKER_00]: ancient hormone whose functions have
diversified along with the evolution of
[SPEAKER_00]: various vertebrate groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this kind of single hormone
that, depending on what animal it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: can have different effects within those
particular species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a way that we're looking
at kind of one hormone if we're consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is particularly for the man-made
hormones, how that might be produced for
[SPEAKER_00]: one animal and how it can negatively
impact or have a different impact on other
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, continuing how hormones target cells,
well, there are steroid hormones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: manufactured from cholesterol.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're lipid soluble, and they can cross
the lipid bilayer in the cell membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bind receptors within the nucleus,
usually hormone receptor complex that
[SPEAKER_00]: binds to DNA, causing changes in gene
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also have anabolic steroids,
which are synthetic compounds resembling
[SPEAKER_00]: testosterone.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cause muscle cells to produce more
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our steroid hormones that are
anabolic steroids, which are synthetic,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning man-made compounds, kind of that
version here with the Hulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, classification of hormones,
we have two major classifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is protein-based hormones,
which are polypeptides, small proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: glycoproteins, so large proteins with
carbohydrates, and amines, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: modified amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have our lipid soluble-based
hormones, which are steroids, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: modified cholesterol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's important, again, to still
keep in mind of the macromolecules,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is carbohydrates, lipids,
and proteins, and the different properties
[SPEAKER_00]: that these may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, looking specific at lipid soluble
hormones, we're going to investigate them
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little bit further here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see lipid soluble hormone in the blood
cells here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our red blood cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes through the blood vessel,
and we see lipid soluble hormones diffuses
[SPEAKER_00]: through the plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hormone binds with a receptor in the
cytoplasm, forming this complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: The receptor-hormone complex enters the
nucleus, triggering gene transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here a change in the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our transcribed mRNA, messenger RNA,
is translated into proteins after that
[SPEAKER_00]: altered cell activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this single hormone gets into the
nucleus, changes gene expression,
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately resulting in a protein being
made that can alter cellular activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: A steroid hormone directly initiates
production of proteins within the target
[SPEAKER_00]: cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to compare lipid soluble
hormones to some of our other hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, steroid hormones are going to fall
under this same category.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be a little clearer to say,
because here we have our steroid hormone
[SPEAKER_00]: directly entering the cell, creating a
complex, going into the nucleus,
[SPEAKER_00]: binding the sites in the chromatin,
activating mRNA transcription,
[SPEAKER_00]: resulting in a cellular response.
[SPEAKER_00]: These steroid hormones enter through the
cell membrane and bind to receptors inside
[SPEAKER_00]: the target cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: These hormones may direct the stimulant
transcription of genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make certain proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because steroid hormones work by targeting
gene activity, the response is slower than
[SPEAKER_00]: the other group we're going to look at,
which is peptide hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So steroids follow the same category as
lipid soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water soluble are a little different here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our water soluble hormone, we notice
here, is binding to a surface receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water soluble hormones are membrane
soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bind to membrane receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look back at the other one here,
there's no membrane here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of went right through,
right to the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are lipid soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're focusing now on water soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bind and activate what's called the G
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: This then is then causing it to then go
through and enter the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're noticing we're not directly going
into the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're binding to surface proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they cannot diffuse directly
through the cell membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're water soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't get by that phospho lipid
bilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: These hormones must bind to surface cell
membrane receptors before initiating a
[SPEAKER_00]: cell signal, as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still an activated protein in the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a very different pathway than our
lipid cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on these peptide hormone
pathways, we see that receptor binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: These peptide hormones, these short
peptides or full size proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: they do not enter the cell directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bind to receptors embedded in the
cell membrane, as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the hormone binds to receptor,
a secondary messenger molecule initiates a
[SPEAKER_00]: cellular response.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here, initiating this response
that then ultimately is going into the
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleus and causing the initiation
indirectly of secondary messengers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This signal transduction is this multiple
fold increase in our message being
[SPEAKER_00]: received within the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peptide hormones are water soluble and
often produce fast responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the benefits of the secondary
messenger system We have the signal that's
[SPEAKER_00]: binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a receptor protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the key part here, we have this
amplification steps that are occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one single binding going through,
we see these multiple amplifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we see amplification from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from one binding, we generate one,
two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[SPEAKER_00]: eight cyclic AMP's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: From those eight, each one of those can
develop a protein kinase, which can
[SPEAKER_00]: produce a whole bunch of enzymes,
which then produce a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this cascade multiplier response is
also a very quick response.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we can produce, the body can
produce very small amounts of hormone and
[SPEAKER_00]: have a very large effect that occurs a
large response of product within the body
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the benefits of the secondary messenger
system is the amplification that can occur
[SPEAKER_00]: in the large amount of product that can be
produced from a very small or relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: small amount of signal being produced
initially by the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
