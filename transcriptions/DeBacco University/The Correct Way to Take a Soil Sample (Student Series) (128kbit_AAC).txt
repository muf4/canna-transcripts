[SPEAKER_02]: In this Tobacco University student series
video, we're going to learn the correct
[SPEAKER_02]: way to take a soil sample in both a field
as well as an indoor application that's
[SPEAKER_02]: using a mineral-based soil and why it's
important to go through this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that we would do a soil test is
because we need to know what's going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil before we actually plant our
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because we want the biggest yields
possible and so we need to know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: amend the soil properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we take a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a soil corer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to want to pick the area that
you plan on growing your plants in and try
[SPEAKER_00]: to dig it in 6 to 10 inches deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's in there, you're going to want
to spin the corer to take your sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we want it 6 to 10 inches deep
is because that's where the roots are most
[SPEAKER_00]: prevalent and we get the best root profile
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're done spinning, you take out
your corer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see we have the soil all in there and
dump it out into your bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, you're ready to take your next
sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now how you go about determining where
that next sample is taken can play into a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit about knowing your field or
knowing your location.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can really be as fine or as broad as
you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the field history is known,
this can be very helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, when in doubt, if you're first
sampling an area, favor more sections and
[SPEAKER_02]: if the results come back similar,
you can merge those the next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things you want to be considering is like
maybe an eroded area, a lightly colored
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, and a darkly colored soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be kind of like a broad way to
kind of segregate things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we're looking at a little bit more of
a detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking into account slope or fence
lines or manure added or a low spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really can get quite detailed with
it if you want to go through and do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now when you're going through and taking
those 6 to 10 samples or more,
[SPEAKER_02]: it should be random, but it should also
still effectively cover the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Minimum of 6 to 10 would be taking
depending on the area that you're looking
[SPEAKER_02]: as far as determining that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is kind of when I talk about
random, you know, an efficient way to walk
[SPEAKER_02]: through the field, but sampling from that
location and repeat the same process for
[SPEAKER_02]: your other subdivisions within your sample
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we've taken all of our samples
out from the ground, we're ready to send
[SPEAKER_00]: it out to be tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're going to need is a labeled
bag so that no one gets confused,
[SPEAKER_00]: either the scientists or you, when it gets
back to you of what soil it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to want to take roughly
two cups, which is like two handfuls of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, and put it into your bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have that ready, just seal it
off, get your paperwork ready,
[SPEAKER_01]: and send it off to the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: All
[SPEAKER_02]: right, we just saw the proper procedure
for soil sampling in outdoor mineral-based
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I want to remind you that if
plants are growing in soilless media,
[SPEAKER_02]: then a soilless media extract sampling
procedure and specialized test should be
[SPEAKER_02]: conducted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a separate video on Tobacco
University on that specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now in this operation that we're going to
see, we're going to move indoors,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're going to use a modified
traditional soil sampling technique
[SPEAKER_02]: because mineral-based soil was used.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a combination of soil and compost
with some rice hulls on the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically the regular soil sampling
procedure could be followed from
[SPEAKER_02]: mineral-based soils with a couple of few
modifications to smaller colors using the
[SPEAKER_02]: trowel, using six to 10 containers to make
our final sample that will be sent to the
[SPEAKER_02]: lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growing in containers is different than a
typical field, but the principles of soil
[SPEAKER_02]: sampling when it's mineral-based is
essentially the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how you take an indoor soil
sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously it's a little different from
taking an outdoor soil sample because we
[SPEAKER_00]: are inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing out of a bucket,
we're already irrigating, and most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time we have amendments made like rice
hulls to prevent bug breeding within the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to want to move anything
obstructing the soil, like the rice hulls,
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the way so you could clearly see
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your trowel and put it in about four
inches deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say that's a good size for this
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to want to cut out an
area, kind of just circle the trowel
[SPEAKER_00]: around until you have like a one inch
diameter to take out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now clearly it's going to be a little more
difficult since we're already rooting,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's still possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just take your hand, grab the sample
out of the bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once you have your soil sample,
you could put it into this bucket and
[SPEAKER_00]: once we have our two cups worth,
we're ready to start sending it out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to need to take labeled
bags to put each of our soil samples in,
[SPEAKER_00]: so neither the scientist or we get
confused when testing the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to take two cups
worth, which is if you don't have a cup,
[SPEAKER_00]: about two handfuls, and put it into the
bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once you have about two cups worth,
you're going to want to take your bag seal
[SPEAKER_00]: it, get your paperwork ready to go,
and send it off to the lab to be tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those that want to learn more
about soil testing, there's some other
[SPEAKER_02]: DeBaco University videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one provides a detailed look into
soil sampling with other tools and methods
[SPEAKER_02]: included, such as using a PVC pipe or just
a simple shovel.
[SPEAKER_02]: When that soil goes off to the lab,
if you want to kind of see what it goes
[SPEAKER_02]: through, well the path of soil through a
testing lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever wonder what that soil kind of
goes through, this shows the full and
[SPEAKER_02]: complete process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then lastly, just another brief
overview of the process with some other
[SPEAKER_02]: suggestions provided.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're welcome to check out these
additional videos on soil sampling,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's very important you get a good
sample to the lab, so you get quality
[SPEAKER_02]: results back, so you can make proper
amendments if you need to.
