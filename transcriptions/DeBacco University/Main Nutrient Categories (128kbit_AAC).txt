[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over main nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: categories, which is important when we're
looking at fertilizing our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the main
nutrient categories so we can be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand each of these three important
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first category is going to be
macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are needed in large amounts,
and that's why I have the picture of the
[SPEAKER_00]: elephant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also might be for two as primary
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are typically the nutrients that
plants show sign of lacking first as they
[SPEAKER_00]: are needed in large or macro amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are also the big three numbers that
are printed, you'll see on fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those three numbers that you always
see are referring to nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus and potassium, the NPK ratio
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all three of these are actually mobile
nutrients, which is important when we
[SPEAKER_00]: might be looking at diagnosing potential
deficiencies or issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are mobile nutrients within the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our first category, the
macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proceeding on from macronutrients,
we then go to secondary nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are needed to less of extent
from fertilizers in most cases and for
[SPEAKER_00]: most plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're often added in other products such
as lime or organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind that these secondary
nutrients, we might be wondering what
[SPEAKER_00]: these secondary nutrients are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're typically magnesium,
calcium and sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are those secondary needed?
[SPEAKER_00]: But to a lesser extent than those
macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That leads us also to our micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And micronutrients are essential for plant
survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want you to realize that they are
essential, but they're only needed in
[SPEAKER_00]: small micro quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can sometimes be referred to as
trace elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are immobile, except chlorine is
the only exception to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So boron, copper, iron, chlorine,
manganese, Mn, molybdenum, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zinc are nutrients that fall into the
micronutrient category.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're needed, but needed in small
amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to lastly here talking about
the micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common deficiencies include zinc,
iron, manganese and copper.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, be aware that it's also easy to
get to toxic levels if you are to add
[SPEAKER_00]: these can often be worse situation
compared to if you had a deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just remember that, that we don't want
to necessarily be fertilizing for our
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are seeing a potential for a
micronutrient deficiency by all means,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, but keep in mind that they're needed
in such small amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to be measuring them in very
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be dosing in very small amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of growers often over add
micronutrients and that can lead to toxic
[SPEAKER_00]: levels in the plants, which can cause more
harm than good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this understands the major categories
of your nutrients.
