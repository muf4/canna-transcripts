[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're going to look at the plant
hormone gibberellin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you look at the three plants
pictured here in the image, and you kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of look at what the difference is between
them, well, it's the distance between the
[SPEAKER_00]: nodes here, the internode length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gibberellins do influence the
internode length of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we see here, gibberellins are GAs,
how they're abbreviated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Referred to GAs as short.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually more than 100 known GAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This subscript denotes the specific GA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be an example of GA3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, subscript is located below.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's known to be essential for stem
elongation, and gibberellin, or GA,
[SPEAKER_00]: causes dwarf mutant plants to actually
grow tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a dwarf mutant and you add GAs
to that, you can actually get that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to return to close to normal height,
or at least get taller than its mutant
[SPEAKER_00]: variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dwarf plants, on the other hand,
are often plants that lack gibberellins,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what causes their dwarfism.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a very classic picture here of some
cabbage plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the normal cabbage plants that we
see over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's ones that have been applied
with GA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see how tall they can get, how those
internodes between those leads can stretch
[SPEAKER_00]: to enormous heights compared to the
normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gibberellins are also involved in seed
germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: GAs will induce genes to make enzymes that
break down starch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, we have our endosperm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our stored energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, GAs can initiate the breakdown of
the endosperm so it can be used for the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed to initially start the formation of
the root and the growing of the shoot to
[SPEAKER_00]: get above the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gibberellins are involved in seed
germination in the sense of being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: initiate the breakdown of that food source
so that it can start to be used to
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate that seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing GAs are used for can be the
effects on grapes, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fruit development.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the grapes that are treated with GAs,
another very classic picture, are much
[SPEAKER_00]: larger and look swelled up, basically,
compared to grapes that were untreated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ever see those large,
plump, giant grapes, could be a result of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant hormone, gibberellin.
