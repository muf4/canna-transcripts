[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you've gotten your soil test back
and you're looking at your pH value,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you need to raise it or lower it,
this Tobacco University video will help
[SPEAKER_00]: you with that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at raising and
lowering pH values based on your soil test
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, you have to know what
your plant prefers because there is no
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal pH across all plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is ideal pH for different plants,
some like very acidic, moderately acidic,
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly acidic, or sometimes even very
alkaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see a list here of plant preferred
pHs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The optimum pH is based on the plant
species you are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most garden plants prefer a soil pH
between 6.0 and 6.8, just to give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: general range.
[SPEAKER_00]: This includes cannabis, however,
hydroponic growers tend to favor a
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly more acidic end of that range of
5.5 to 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notable exceptions are acid-loving
blueberries, which prefer a pH of around
[SPEAKER_00]: 4.5 to 5.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potato varieties without scab resistance
are also grown in lower pH, and by lower
[SPEAKER_00]: pH I mean the 5.2 to 5.4 range simply put
to inhibit the growth of this disease
[SPEAKER_00]: organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, look at the different list here,
see what target pH range you will be
[SPEAKER_00]: targeting to match your particular plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now also, region can impact pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geographic area can also influence native
soil pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, soil pH by region on the east
coast here, looking at usually the 4.8 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 5.5 range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Midwest, you're talking that 6 to 6.5,
and the southwest around that 7.5 to 8.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on the region of country that
you live in here in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might be looking at more of looking at
raising your pH, maybe more at lowering
[SPEAKER_00]: your pH there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now getting your plants to that optimum pH
range, how does that kind of play into
[SPEAKER_00]: things here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you will likely need to raise or
lower your soil's pH to reach the optimum
[SPEAKER_00]: levels for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we're looking at trying to be
as close to that optimum range as possible
[SPEAKER_00]: because you could get into toxic or root
damaging conditions or also poor nutrition
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the nutrients not being available
to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to raise the soil pH,
well, you're looking at typically adding a
[SPEAKER_00]: limestone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ground limestone is commonly used to
help raise soil's pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil testing labs will often offer
recommendations that's based on the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: pH, the plants being grown, and the
buffering capacity of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to use their recommendations
at least as a good starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, the lower the pH and the more
clay and organic matter in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: the greater amount of limestones required
to raise the soil pH to the target level.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be important if you're looking at
comparing different fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be at the same pH level,
but why does the lab recommend different
[SPEAKER_00]: results for one versus another?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have to do with the particular
content of that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we're making limestone
applications just in general, limestone
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations by the soil lab are made
in tons per acre or can be pounds per
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred or pounds per thousand square
feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So know the square foot of the area of
grow space that you'll be growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Limestone needs to react with the soil,
so it's highly recommended to be tilled
[SPEAKER_00]: and incorporated into the soil in some
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't just want to go through apply it
to the surface and then walk away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you apply it to the surface?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then go through making sure you're
working it into that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not going to incorporate lime,
then apply no more than 50 to 75 pounds
[SPEAKER_00]: per thousand square feet or five to seven
and a half pounds per hundred square feet
[SPEAKER_00]: to the soil surface at any one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reapply one to six month intervals until a
total recommendation is administered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's again important for that
surface application.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to create a solid little
layer of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to give it some time to kind of
work in hopefully with rain events into
[SPEAKER_00]: that soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we're looking at our limestone
options, while it is all limestone,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are actually additional options,
the main two being either powdered or
[SPEAKER_00]: pelletized.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will take several months to a year
for soil pH to increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have moved pH in winter months,
so it doesn't necessarily take a full
[SPEAKER_00]: calendar year.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it is possible to move a full
point even over winter months,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I mentioned, if you're using powdered
lime as applied and tilled into the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: because the pelletized, while it's the
same type of lime, that powdered lime can
[SPEAKER_00]: be a little more quicker acting because
it's got a greater surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can come in contact with the soil
particles a little quicker, but it is much
[SPEAKER_00]: more difficult to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pelletized lime, the little pellets
here, is much easier to apply,
[SPEAKER_00]: but may take longer to adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would this be the same if they're both
limestone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're essentially both limestone,
but inside a small coating here of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pelletized to make the application easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, that coating causes a slight
delay as the coating dissolves before it
[SPEAKER_00]: can kind of start to adjust the soil pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the options within limestone more than
just the type of kind of pelletized or
[SPEAKER_00]: powdered, we also have options here of
dolomitic, calcitic, and hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of those things are just lime,
but there's actually three main types.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's dolomitic limestone, which is
calcium carbonate plus magnesium
[SPEAKER_00]: carbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the most commonly found lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains elevated levels of magnesium,
which can be an added bonus for some
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's calcitic lime, which is a
calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often called high cal lime,
and it lacks those high levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its use of magnesium levels are determined
to already be at the optimum level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's hydrated lime, which is
calcium hydroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very quick acting lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may change the pH quickly, but keep in
mind that while it may do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: it does not have as long residual and
change and alteration of the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the other lime options mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, hydrated lime is a mucus membrane
irritant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful if you're applying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can really irritate your nose,
your mouth, anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very, especially if it's
powdered, just be mindful when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you'll typically see the
big label here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warning, keep out of reach of children and
read the label for cautions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the opposite case of the lime,
we're now looking at, we're going to lower
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil's pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that we need a soil acidifier,
which is typically sulfur or ferrous
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are often recommended to lower pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as we saw with the limestone,
these recommendations are usually offered
[SPEAKER_00]: in tons per acre or pounds per hundred or
thousand square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to know your growing
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on what the soil is made out of
or what the components are, it may alter
[SPEAKER_00]: the lowering pH, the sulfur
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these compounds though do need to
react with the soil, just like the lime
[SPEAKER_00]: does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important that you incorporate it
into the soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you're not going to be
incorporating it, the sulfur should be
[SPEAKER_00]: applied no more than 400 pounds to the
acres at the soil surface at any one time
[SPEAKER_00]: to establish plants per year, just to give
you an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfur and that ferrous sulfate,
so keep in mind that elemental sulfur,
[SPEAKER_00]: spring applications and incorporation work
best since the acidification process is
[SPEAKER_00]: based on soil biology and not a chemical
reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil temperature should be above 55
degrees Fahrenheit and have good aeration
[SPEAKER_00]: so the bacteria can be active and cause
that now reduction in pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this feels anaerobic or waterlogged,
the sulfur gets converted into hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfide, which actually can damage plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we want it to be aerated and
well drained.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now ferrous sulfate is more costly to use
in sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need eight times more ferrous sulfate
is needed in elemental sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it is quicker acting than sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, pros and cons depending on what
type of area you might be dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you want to avoid aluminum sulfate and
sulfuric acid because these seem like they
[SPEAKER_00]: might be good options, but aluminum
sulfate can be toxic to certain plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, blueberries, if high rates
are applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irrigating with dilute sulfuric acid can
lower the soil pH, but can damage plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and can corrode metal pipes, fittings and
irrigation systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while these sound like they would lower
pH and technically they will, there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: negative side effects that don't allow
them to really be recommended in an
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural type setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, as I mentioned before,
you want to follow the lab
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is based on the lab that you select.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to take the pH, they're
going to take your soil type, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take buffering capacities,
and they're going to go through and kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of utilize all those factors to give you a
good recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't necessarily 100% agree with
that recommendation, you might want to
[SPEAKER_00]: favor maybe in the slightly lower side or
really use their recommendation as a good
[SPEAKER_00]: starting point and then see how your soil
reacts over time and base your repeated
[SPEAKER_00]: applications on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this was helpful and allowing
you to understand if you want to raise or
[SPEAKER_00]: lower your soil pH.
