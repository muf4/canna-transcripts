[SPEAKER_00]: Okay here we're going to be looking at the
large intestine in some detail here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember it's a large intestine because
of its diameter not because of its length.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the large intestine in
general or the colon as it might be
[SPEAKER_00]: referred to it's only about 1.5 meters or
4.9 feet long and 7.5 centimeters or three
[SPEAKER_00]: inches wide just to give you an
approximation for humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a larger diameter than the small
intestine so small intestine might be
[SPEAKER_00]: longer but we're looking at large and
small being a comparison of the diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: No digestion and a little absorption take
place in the large intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's primary function is to act as a
refuse and dump by collecting and
[SPEAKER_00]: compacting solid waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of the food particles or
what's left of them before they're
[SPEAKER_00]: excreted out of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feces pass through the rectum as a result
of peristalsis and leave the body through
[SPEAKER_00]: the anus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now within our large intestine looking at
the histology looking at kind of its
[SPEAKER_00]: cellular level here the large intestine
small intestine which I didn't show the
[SPEAKER_00]: small intestine is only showing the large
are adapted for digestive functions for
[SPEAKER_00]: each organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: The micrograph shows the colon simple
columnar epithelial cobalt cells and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at them here and this why you see
this kind of like up and down this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like large area here you could also see
this here looking at that in folds that do
[SPEAKER_00]: occur in the large intestine and the
microvilli as pointed out here are very
[SPEAKER_00]: important in the small intestine for
absorbing food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in the large intestine they're
looking at mostly absorbing or reabsorbing
[SPEAKER_00]: water to avoid dehydration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large intestine functions of the large
intestine as I mentioned there to
[SPEAKER_00]: reabsorption of the water and bile salts
compact of intestinal contents into feces
[SPEAKER_00]: absorption of important vitamins produced
by bacteria storage of fecal material
[SPEAKER_00]: prior to the defecation process before
it's finally excreted out of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again see where that's located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now parts of the large intestine which
I'll kind of talk about some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: regions in a moment but we have the cecum
and we have the appendix we're starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an expanded pouch receives
materials arriving from the ilium that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the end part of the small intestine it
stores materials and begins the compaction
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the appendix located right down here
we're seeing that this is a slender hollow
[SPEAKER_00]: appendage only about you know nine
centimeters 1.3 inches long is downed by
[SPEAKER_00]: lymph nodes and lymph node organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe familiar with appendicitis or an
issue and that's basically food that may
[SPEAKER_00]: get trapped in here and cause potential
issues there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now parts of large intestine looking at
the colon for example here has a large
[SPEAKER_00]: diameter and thinner wall than the small
intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wall of the colon forms a series of
pouches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hustra permit expansion in elongation of
the colon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again we're talking about the cecum
we're going to kind of work our way down
[SPEAKER_00]: and around through the anatomy of in
general the colon region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So parts of the colon we have the
ascending colon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ascending means up and that's exactly
what's happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the blue region begins at the
superior border of the cecum and this
[SPEAKER_00]: ascending colon uses muscles and
contraction to push up any undigested food
[SPEAKER_00]: products from the cecum to the top of the
abdominal cavity just below the right
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom edge of the liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind the liver is located about
here and we're working our way kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: within the large intestine towards that
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sends along the lateral and posterior
wall of the peritoneal cavity and the
[SPEAKER_00]: inferior surface of the liver and bends to
the right colic flexure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after we go up this ascending colon
we're going to come across here and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have the transverse colon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the second section of the colon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's anterior to the abdominal wall from
the right to left hand side of the abdomen
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately under the stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives you the idea of exactly what
we're talking about within the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the descending colon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food particles travel down the descending
colon, comes back down on the left side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the abdomen close to the spleen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be looking at this image
initially and say, oh, it's on the right
[SPEAKER_00]: side but keep in mind the way it's
oriented in the body that would be your
[SPEAKER_00]: left side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's attached to the abdominal wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sigmoid here, the very kind of the
end, a little S-shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, about that 15 centimeters to six
inches long at the end of the colon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lies posterior to the urinary bladder and
towards the small intestine, therefore
[SPEAKER_00]: terminating at just before the rectum and
that'd be the very last component here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that last part's that rectum region in
red right here, number five on this graph,
[SPEAKER_00]: on this image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around the end, the large intestine,
it's only about one to almost an inch and
[SPEAKER_00]: a half, 2.5 to four centimeters long.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where residual waste cumulates and
stretches the rectum until you feel the
[SPEAKER_00]: urge to go to the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where you send the signals to
basically excrete that from the body and
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately when it is passing out of the
body, it's leaving out the very end
[SPEAKER_00]: portion here called the anus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rectum opens the outside through the
anus and feces will exit through the anus
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's a contractile sphincter,
little muscle there that will help process
[SPEAKER_00]: that food particles or the waste particles
at this point outside of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, I've mentioned here I have a
colonoscopy and this is a test that allows
[SPEAKER_00]: for visual inspection of the interior
lining of the large intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps doctors identify ulcers,
polyps, tumors and errors in inflammation
[SPEAKER_00]: or bleeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how these can be collected for biopsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how your colon should look.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a very large polyp,
this would be numerous small polyps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically a camera going through
there so doctors can get a visual
[SPEAKER_00]: inspection and hopefully they will see a
nice smooth region but if they see these
[SPEAKER_00]: polyps, if they catch them early,
it can be a life-saving procedure.
