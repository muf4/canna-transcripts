[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to discuss a very
destructive plant insect called aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while they may be small in size,
what they lack in size, they definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: can make up for it in numbers and
destruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first off, identifying what you have
is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for identification of aphids,
well, they are very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, looking at the canvas
plant, how small they look in comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a little white dust
covering the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What allows them to kind of mass multiply,
and it's a little scary sometimes here,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that they can be born pregnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we can have an aphid kind of within an
aphid, giving rise to more aphids,
[SPEAKER_00]: really causing their numbers to increase
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to say they can't lay eggs,
but this is one way that they can mass
[SPEAKER_00]: multiply.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are piercing insects, so their mouth
parts are for piercing, looking
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically at getting into the phloem,
which transports the sugars of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are six aphid species in particular
that specifically attack cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there's many other species,
six in particular have been identified to
[SPEAKER_00]: attack cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, where to look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most adults do not have wings,
so you want to look at the underside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They typically shy away from areas of
bright light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some species prefer older, lower leaves,
and others prefer younger, upper leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, where you find them in the plant may
help identify what particular type of
[SPEAKER_00]: aphid that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, regardless of what type,
they all follow the same basic pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have very similar ways that they
can destroy the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early damage can be a challenge to detect,
in part because they are so small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honeydew will be excreted from the aphids,
and this is one indicating factor when you
[SPEAKER_00]: are looking at identifying them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how to prevent aphids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's important to do this because
they can vector diseases, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses, protiviruses to be exact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warm moist conditions with minimal air
movement will increase the damage occurred
[SPEAKER_00]: by aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to inspect incoming plants for
them and avoid high nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilization, as this can promote lush
growth that is favorable for aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids kind of like this kind of bloated
look to leaves, and they can easily cause
[SPEAKER_00]: through and infect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they do infect that, particularly
when they transmit viruses, you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of weird mottled look to the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also get this weird kind of
crinkly look to some of the leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: and other leaves will look fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very indicative of a viral
infection, typically vectored by aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what a vector is is just an
intermediate that can transport certain
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases to other ultimate hosts here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how to control them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two common control methods are lady
beetles and green lacewings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lady beetles can be refrigerated and
released when it's advantageous to the
[SPEAKER_00]: grower within reason, and releasing them
to evening or early morning near aphid
[SPEAKER_00]: colonies while the vents are closed is a
way to get the maximum effectiveness from
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may need VP applications, and they're
easily purchased and released,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it makes it great for grower control.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one that can be used for aphids
are green lacewings, and they can spread
[SPEAKER_00]: larvae over an area because they're
cannibalistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do buy them as larvae,
you want to spread them out because they
[SPEAKER_00]: will eat each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to look for clean new growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sign that aphids has been killed in
the sense that you've reduced that
[SPEAKER_00]: population, and the plant's now able to
produce new growth again.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, keep in mind if you're using
these in a greenhouse, and it does get
[SPEAKER_00]: warm above 95 degrees, they typically will
leave the greenhouse area in seek of
[SPEAKER_00]: cooler temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these are two methods of
biological control for aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a little link down here if you want to
learn a little bit more about aphids and
[SPEAKER_00]: how to control them and prevent them from
damaging your crops.
