[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at transport
through cell membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw a little bit about the cell
membrane in a previous video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at learning a little bit
more about the actual transport process
[SPEAKER_00]: that occurs in order for things to pass
through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, a cell membrane is
semi-permeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only allows certain things to come
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the basics here,
this is a great description image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our cell and we're focusing on
this area right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a zoomed-in version of that would be
right here, our cell membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are carbohydrates, we have our
glycoproteins, we have our protein
[SPEAKER_00]: channels, our cholesterol, glycolipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we zoom in even closer, if we look just
at this area in the green box,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, that's our phospholipid bilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our bilayer of our phosphates and
our lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look at one specific of those,
call it the head and the tail region,
[SPEAKER_00]: that'd be our phospholipid, our
hydrophilic head, we're in lichen water,
[SPEAKER_00]: and hydrophobic tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does all this come together?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this helps regulate the passage of
substances into and out of the cells
[SPEAKER_00]: between cell organelles and the cytosol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember organelles, we had a whole
lecture series on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cytosol, in this case, would be this
gray area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to detect chemical
messengers arriving at the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important for cells to be able to
recognize certain hormones or other
[SPEAKER_00]: substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also link adjacent cells together
by membrane junctions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anchor cells to the extracellular
matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see there's a lot going on here
as the functions of our cell membrane,
[SPEAKER_00]: more than just kind of creating a
protective layer on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: One important function here is transport,
and this takes on many forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left of my image over here,
a protein spans the membrane, again going
[SPEAKER_00]: from the extracellular space to the
intracellular space.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may provide a hydrophilic channel
across the membrane that's selected for a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular solute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, it's allowing the small
little green molecules to come through.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right-hand side here, other
transport proteins shuttle substances from
[SPEAKER_00]: one side to the other by changing shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, it's open on the top,
and it's closed on top and bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's open only on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these proteins hydrolyze or
release ATP as an energy source to
[SPEAKER_00]: actively pump substances across the
membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certain ones, certain protein channels,
just passively allow it to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others require ATP or this energy
investment for transporting molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it looks like the larger,
lighter green kind of oval-shaped ones
[SPEAKER_00]: require a different protein to be moved
across this membrane than the small green
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's three categories we can kind of
rank the transport in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be diffusion, carrier mediated,
or vesicle transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now within these, we can subdivide them
into active and passive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the transport, the cell membrane,
can be active.
[SPEAKER_00]: This requires energy and ATP, like active
learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do in class requires energy and
your body to use ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily your favorite thing to do,
but it's that active transport is still
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's passive, which we all wish is
how we could learn through no energy
[SPEAKER_00]: requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just kind of sit there and hope that
you just kind of learn all the
[SPEAKER_00]: information, but inquiring no energy
investment on your point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, I'll tell you right now in this
class, we haven't found out already,
[SPEAKER_00]: tends to be more of the active transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within these three categories,
we have diffusion, which is simply
[SPEAKER_00]: passive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just things diffuse from higher
concentration to lower concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carrier mediated transport, this can be
passive or active.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because something requires a
protein to move it across the barrier
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't always mean it's active transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it just needs that protein act
as a channel to be able to move its way
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times it will require ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our transport through the
vesicles, this will always require energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The formation of the vesicles and be able
to pull things through, that is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: require energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking here, a nice example of passive
and active, remember extracellular fluid
[SPEAKER_00]: are bringing things into the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Passive transport is diffusion of a
substance across a membrane with no energy
[SPEAKER_00]: investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: No energy investment is the key point
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not mean no proteins or other
channels are needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's three main types.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's simple diffusion, facilitated
diffusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one that does require proteins
or osmosis, which is movement of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our passive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have oxygen just diffusing right
through the membrane, an area of higher
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration to an area of lower
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sodium ions require a channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's still passive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we call facilitated
diffusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where it is simply diffusing
across but does require this protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: This protein isn't requiring any energy to
have it occur, but the protein is
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's active here where we're
having a pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually using ATP here to ADP to
move, in this case, sodium ions out and
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium ions into the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that facilitated
diffusion, remember still diffusion,
[SPEAKER_00]: no energy required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Active transport is actively using ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
