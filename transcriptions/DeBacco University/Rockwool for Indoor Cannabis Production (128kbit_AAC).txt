[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to learn more about Rockwell
for indoor cannabis production?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've come to the right place here on
Tobacco University where we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into Rockwell for
indoor cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, there's many potential uses for
Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used at any stage of growth of
cannabis production, not just clones like
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people associate it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers prefer to use it only in the
early stages, but it can be used for full
[SPEAKER_00]: term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other growers will grow plants in it for
the entire growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may choose to use it for only a
portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may choose it to use it for the entire
growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's entirely up to you, but I'm going to
provide you with some of the details about
[SPEAKER_00]: it so you can make an educated decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I'll start with the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just kind of like what is Rockwell in
general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Rockwell is a lightweight substrate
made from spinning molten balsic rock into
[SPEAKER_00]: fine fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's commonly used in hydroponic growing
setups, especially in commercial settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's formed into a range of cubes,
and blocks, and growing slabs,
[SPEAKER_00]: large slabs, and also granular products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because it is kind of this stone wool
or Rockwell kind of insulation-like
[SPEAKER_00]: material, it can be made into different
shapes, sizes to allow it to be utilized
[SPEAKER_00]: for different parts of the growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the properties of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are so many people using it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Rockwell can have good balance
between the ability to hold water and
[SPEAKER_00]: still provide sufficient aeration for the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydroponic setups often use Rockwell
because it has a slow drain time,
[SPEAKER_00]: which allows for feeding and watering,
and it can also be very specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a Rockwell cube sitting on a
bed of perlite with a cannabis clone in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, all these are reasons why
Rockwell is so popular with many growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the benefits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the properties, some of the
advantages?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that natural balance between holding
water and aeration are conducive for root
[SPEAKER_00]: growth in development, and you just want
bigger, better roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lightweight, which can reduce the shipping
expense and provides a sterile growing
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only can it ship fairly easily,
because it's lightweight, does take up
[SPEAKER_00]: some volume, but as far as the weight
isn't a great deal, it can also provide a
[SPEAKER_00]: sterile growing environment, which is
great to reduce the chance of implementing
[SPEAKER_00]: any sort of disease, especially on the
early stages of growth, but really for all
[SPEAKER_00]: stages that it's being utilized in.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you do want to watch out for the
algal growth here that can occur in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holding water and light with grow lights
or sunlight, they can also cause algae to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, disposal can be an issue due to the
fact that it really doesn't decompose or
[SPEAKER_00]: break down all that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be thinking about the kind
of full growth cycle there of,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, if I'm going to use it here,
where's it all going to end up and can I
[SPEAKER_00]: dispose of it properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some options for Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said it's kind of a manufactured
product, so it can be offered in a variety
[SPEAKER_00]: of situations and sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some small little starter plugs,
there's some slightly larger cubes,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's bigger blocks, and then we get
into the slabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the companies start with little
starter plugs and we could see here is a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that starter plug will fit very
easily into that cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that cube can be placed on a block
and that block can be placed on the slabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can allow those roots to fully expand
and helps minimize root disturbance and
[SPEAKER_00]: allow this product to be used for the
entire growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how would you prepare Rockwell if
this is something you are considering?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to always check what they
manufacture, but at the very least
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwell will need to have a pre-soak in
water before you go in planting in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some needs to be soaked in water to help
regulate the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some can just be soaked in regular water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still, however, a good idea to check
the soaking water's pH before,
[SPEAKER_00]: during, and after the Rockwell soak to
help ensure that this will not be an
[SPEAKER_00]: unexpected stress on the plants and limit
their nutrient availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, that water soak targets,
so instead of soaking your water,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, what should the target should you
be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, depending if you're using Rockwell
for the propagation or growth cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: the targets may vary slightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in general, it should be shooting
for pH around 5.3 to 5.5, a parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million content of around 400,
a temperature around 65 to 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, a soak time of two to five
minutes will help ensure that air bubbles
[SPEAKER_00]: are removed and full absorption has
occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that point of saturation here
and the grower here taking the pH reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: All good things that are shown in the
picture and all good things you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing in the practice if you're
looking at growing your plants in Rockwell.
