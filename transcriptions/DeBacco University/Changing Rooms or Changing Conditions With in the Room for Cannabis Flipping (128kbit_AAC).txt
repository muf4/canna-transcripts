[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBake University video,
I'm going to go over should you be
[SPEAKER_00]: changing rooms or should be changing
conditions within the room when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: flipping your cannabis plants from the
vegetative to the flowering phase of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and production.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over changing rooms or
what should you change conditions within
[SPEAKER_00]: the room for cannabis flipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, when you're changing the
room, well, in this case, growers will
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain conditions in the same in the
room, which causes the need to move plants
[SPEAKER_00]: when growers want plants to be exposed to
different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you're taking your plants from one
room, it's under one set of parameters and
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions environment and moving them to
another as different parameters and
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is efficient when it comes to
lighting and cooling needs because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: all set up and all climate controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall is the need to physically
move those plants, which could result in
[SPEAKER_00]: damage, also labor and working them from
one area to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why some growers will choose to
change the conditions within the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this allows plants to stay in the same
physical location, but the conditions must
[SPEAKER_00]: be changed by the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We must be altering or have a way of
altering those environmental conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: because those plants are going to have
different requirements as they go through
[SPEAKER_00]: the aging process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just veg to flower when we're
talking about this transition to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The largest change in plants is from veg
to flower, but these same concepts can be
[SPEAKER_00]: applied to other stage changes that the
plants go through because another key
[SPEAKER_00]: transition point is from the propagation
phase to the vegetative stage where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going from the seedling or small clone
phase to kind of that true vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be another alteration that occurs
in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So changing the room, when we're looking
at changing the room, when certain
[SPEAKER_00]: specific conditions are dialed in by an
indoor grower, often this comes at the
[SPEAKER_00]: result of many pieces of equipment working
in conjunction to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lighting, the heating, the HVAC,
the carbon dioxide enrichment,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of factors come into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be quite a challenge since once
the systems are dialed in, making changes
[SPEAKER_00]: can offset this balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why some growers tend to set up a
room, get it all dialed in and have
[SPEAKER_00]: another room with different conditions all
dialed in and then simply move the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: into or out of how they want them to be
exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the moving the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with the environment being set,
when a grower wants to change the
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, plants need to be moved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often the type of lighting and the cooling
system can be important and these two
[SPEAKER_00]: systems are in competition with one
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: This typically occurs when the plants are
transitioning from the vegetative growth
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle to the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers do need to be careful when it
comes to moving plants since often they
[SPEAKER_00]: need to pass through a small doorway,
need to move down a hallway.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that they're
well-staked, they're well-supported before
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going through and making that move
or that physical transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those dedicated flower rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, often the flower rooms gets the
attention and this is where the final
[SPEAKER_00]: product is harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, flower rooms' vegetative
propagation and drying all are important
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these rooms, the flower room's humidity
control is extra important to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of bud rot developing or botrytis,
especially late in the season or late in
[SPEAKER_00]: plant development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're changing the conditions,
keep in mind that when growers decide to
[SPEAKER_00]: change the environmental conditions in a
room so the plants can stay in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: physical place, we need to have a way to
completely alter those.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, changing should not be distracted
to use advanced plant stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're changing from one
environmental condition to another,
[SPEAKER_00]: that drastic change, we don't want to have
that drastic change occur in just one
[SPEAKER_00]: two-hour period.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to slowly reduce and change so
those plants are not exposed to a drastic
[SPEAKER_00]: stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers also need systems to check to make
sure the change is made or what is
[SPEAKER_00]: expected and the systems are able to
maintain those plant-favorable conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you check it once and you go,
okay, that looks perfectly good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go through and just assume it
all went to plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might want to make some alterations there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're seeing a change in humidity in
24 hours quite drastically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to be sure we're prepared for
that and are able to have our plants make
[SPEAKER_00]: that transition and for it to be favorable
for their growth and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now either method is the same result,
whether you're changing the room or
[SPEAKER_00]: changing the conditions within the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter what method is
implemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since they've done correctly, plant
performance will be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, for ease for the grower,
sometimes having those independent rooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's an option, is tend to be favored
because it really allows conditions to be
[SPEAKER_00]: set and only the plants to go through that
alteration of the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go through and just assume it all
went to plan.
