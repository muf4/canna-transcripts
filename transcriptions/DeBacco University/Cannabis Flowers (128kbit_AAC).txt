[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to take a detailed
look at the flowers that cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: produces.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we know, they produce female flowers or
male flowers, but being able to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: those at different stages is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early on, plants produce something called
preflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the first way to visually
determine if the plant is male or if the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is female.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to look at the leaf node for
these preflowers, which will typically be
[SPEAKER_00]: seen after about a month or so of
vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preflowers are typically found between the
fourth and sixth node as you count up from
[SPEAKER_00]: the base of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not advised to induce flowering until
these preflowers appear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though you can have a plant flower at
any time, these preflowers are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like your indication that the plant's
ready to kind of go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female preflower looks like this,
looking very down at the node here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of see those white kind of structures
sticking out, those white stigmas coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another example of a female
preflower with those stigmas a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: These white kind of wispy, almost like
whiskers, protruding here from the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: node here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Male preflowers look a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The females is the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend more that cup shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be the pollen producing
structure and contain the anthers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another example of a male preflower
a little bit more developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of see again that kind of larger
cup shaped appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Female's indicative of that kind of white
stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here and here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Male's a little bit larger, more bulb type
looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will ultimately produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female's the stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal in the end would be to capture
the pollen there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now male flowers, as I said, they are
producing pollen, as you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen on canvas is very fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can travel long distances in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can identify them since they have
distinct pollen sacs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, here, and this is one that's clearly
shedding some pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are of little value,
low cannabinoid content, and should be
[SPEAKER_00]: discarded to reduce unnecessary labor and
the potential for cross pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, the pollen they produce can
create not only a mess, as we see here on
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves, but could result in unwanted
pollination of neighboring female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Male flowers reach maturity about one to
two weeks ahead of the female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great for identification because
you can usually identify them a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the plant standpoint, this is
advantageous because this way pollen will
[SPEAKER_00]: be ready in the area when the females are
receptive to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why male flowers are a little bit
earlier and this is allowing the plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: ideally survive in the long term because
there will always be pollen available when
[SPEAKER_00]: those females are ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male plant, overall male plants
produce less total flowers since each
[SPEAKER_00]: flower can produce high amounts of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though if you look at this fully
developed male plant, you can see how much
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers are present on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why they need to produce as
much is plants are producing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen grains per single flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's allowing us to easily get
caught in the wind, easily get caught in
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation, and pass it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why we don't want to grow
plants necessarily to this full size and
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy them as early as possible,
as we can identify them, because if a
[SPEAKER_00]: female flower gets fertilized,
the female plant will transition more to
[SPEAKER_00]: seed formation and not cannabinoid or CBD
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can really reduce the amount of
harvest someone's getting from a chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: profile standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then going on to the female flowers,
their distinguishing factor are white
[SPEAKER_00]: fuzzy stigmas that we see here and
definitely in this image.
[SPEAKER_00]: This structure may take a little bit more
time to develop as they may be formed
[SPEAKER_00]: after light green seed bracts at the node.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are kind of apical buds here,
very easy to see, but initially if we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking right at that leaf node for early
identification, these may be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: slower to develop definitely than compared
to the male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should start looking for them around
the fourth to fifth branch of the
[SPEAKER_00]: internodes as you work your way up the
plant as a way to try to determine the
[SPEAKER_00]: gender of your plant, whether it's female
or whether it's male.
[SPEAKER_00]: The early determination will be great to
allow you to know early on whether you
[SPEAKER_00]: should be keeping that plant, investing
time and labor, whether investing
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer on that plant, or if you should
be discarding it if it's a male because it
[SPEAKER_00]: may produce pollen which could contaminate
your entire rural area.
