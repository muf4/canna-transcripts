[SPEAKER_00]: Now while this image shows the curing
process for wine bottles, the same can be
[SPEAKER_00]: applied to cannabis and how the importance
of this curing process is for the final
[SPEAKER_00]: determination of the end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So buds should be placed in a sealable
airtight container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canning jars are commonly used,
but watch out for a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have that curing process be a
very dark and heavily shaded process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The full curing process may take up to
about two weeks, and this is the final
[SPEAKER_00]: step in the curing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Curing containers typically have a light
block, so you don't want to use something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to be storing it where
there is going to be some light exposure,
[SPEAKER_00]: they do make some light block containers
as we see here in this file.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, just keep them in a dark
location and you'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another key component is that it's
airtight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many growers are adding two-way humidity
control packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically the goal is 62% humidity for
cannabis curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this VEDA humidity control is a
two-way control pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is commonly used for humidity
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why it's two-way, meaning it
offers the advantage of increasing or
[SPEAKER_00]: decreasing the humidity level to try to
maintain at 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put here within reason because if it's
extremely wet or extremely dry,
[SPEAKER_00]: this can only do so much, but that two-way
control is trying to maintain as close to
[SPEAKER_00]: that 62% humidity as possible by either
adding humidity or taking it away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: sealed environment that we have here in
this canning jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the importance of humidity control
during the curing is that you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: retain those terpene levels, increase the
shelf life, maintain the quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: and reduce the chance of mold forming in
the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goals through proper humidity control and
proper drying, proper growing process,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can end up with a premium quality bud
here that has all the high cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: and shows the true end product of the
plant in your growing ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
