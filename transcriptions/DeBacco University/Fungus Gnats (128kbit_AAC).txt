[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be learning a little
bit more about fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see a zoomed in picture of one
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is about three millimeters
long, just to give you an idea of the size
[SPEAKER_00]: of these fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often discovered when plants are moved,
that jostled effect, you can kind of see
[SPEAKER_00]: them moving about at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larvae is about two to four
millimeters long and have translucent
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies and black heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have the portability to fly,
even though they do have some wings,
[SPEAKER_00]: portability to fly when they can't fly
very long distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where to look, which is key for the
identification for these, is inspecting
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots for dark spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the evidence of one right here
and two here and one kind of over in this
[SPEAKER_00]: area and a bunch kind of located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're commonly found in the growing
media since they infest plant roots close
[SPEAKER_00]: to the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't dig down very far.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are close to that surface area and
that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking to try to find these and
identify if you do have these in your
[SPEAKER_00]: container or near your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal here to prevent them is to keep
the surface as dry as you can to help
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the pressure on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this can be after you plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could top dress with like perlite,
sand or rice hulls.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all ways to kind of keep that
surface very dry, which can really reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: and prevent the fungus gnats from getting
established.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can increase with numbers when plants
are stressed by nutrients or excesses of
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by over watering or kind of
overstressing the plants can be other ways
[SPEAKER_00]: you can encourage fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly excessive irrigation,
keeping that soil surface wet will only
[SPEAKER_00]: hurt your plants by both suffocating the
roots, but also potentially increasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus gnats population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungus gnats can also live on green algae
that may be growing in media or
[SPEAKER_00]: containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So important to keep that clean for a
variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Avoid excessive water in the media and the
environment as this only encourages fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats development.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to control them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's predatory mites that can be
an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some feed on both the eggs and the larvae,
which is a great one to select.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adults do not feed on the plant and
females can live to 200 eggs in the media
[SPEAKER_00]: in seven to 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: BT or bacillus thuringiensis can be
applied to the media surface and is
[SPEAKER_00]: effective against the larvae as we can see
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a leaf sample here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are peanut leaves, but just shows
you the example of the effectiveness of
[SPEAKER_00]: BT.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a normal peanut leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one that's been treated with BT.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the much reduced feeding
activity on the ones treated with BT,
[SPEAKER_00]: but those that have not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the mouth parts here of the
fungus gnats indicating they can be pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive feeders and really be very
destructive to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
