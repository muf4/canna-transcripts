[SPEAKER_00]: This is intended to be a brief overview of
rooting hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its goal is to produce, you know,
clones and plants that have a nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: fibrous root system to allow for nutrient
water absorption, and adding hormones can
[SPEAKER_00]: help encourage this to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, rooting hormones are
typically auxin-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one here, and one we'll see,
is typically, it could be made from NAA or
[SPEAKER_00]: IBA.
[SPEAKER_00]: IBA is end-all-3-butyric acid,
and that's a very common one that's used
[SPEAKER_00]: in many rooting products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a difference between there's a
gel-based and there's also a powder-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, the hormone is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Hormonin, this is Clon-X.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both contain that IBA
end-all-3-butyric acid, where often the
[SPEAKER_00]: gel can adhere better to the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the longer the hormone comes in
contact, it can improve the odds of
[SPEAKER_00]: rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, Clon-X gel is superior
to most other ones that I've used.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you're using it,
be sure to store it in the refrigerator
[SPEAKER_00]: around 40 degrees Fahrenheit so the
hormone, the auxin, does not degrade with
[SPEAKER_00]: heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, while these are both the same
hormone, this powder tends to be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit harder to stick onto some of the
stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This purple sticky gel adheres a little
bit better, and I think that's part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why this one tends to encourage a
little bit more rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The importance of roots, well,
there's also these things, root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very thin, they're about one cell
thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're structures that allow for maximum
absorption of water and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They create this web, which is a very high
surface, area-to-volume ratio,
[SPEAKER_00]: and while they're very small, they are
visible to the naked eye, but they're more
[SPEAKER_00]: easily seen at the aid of a light
microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Careful protection of root hairs from
desiccation and physical damage must be
[SPEAKER_00]: taken to ensure that the plant is able to
efficiently and effectively absorb water
[SPEAKER_00]: and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hormones can help increase this web that
occurs, whether we're talking about clones
[SPEAKER_00]: or cuttings, or even seedlings to help
encourage them to produce this web.
