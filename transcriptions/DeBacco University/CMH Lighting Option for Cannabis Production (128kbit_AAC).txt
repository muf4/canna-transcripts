[SPEAKER_00]: If you're considering CMH lighting options
for your cannabis production, this video
[SPEAKER_00]: should prove helpful in providing you with
some explanations so you better understand
[SPEAKER_00]: ceramic metal halide lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go over CMH lighting
options for the greater understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, they've increased in
popularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the use of ceramic metal halide lights
or CMH and light emitting ceramics,
[SPEAKER_00]: LEC, grow lights are increasing in usage
in both commercial and hobby grower
[SPEAKER_00]: settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: These lights are typically 10% or greater
energy efficient and provide the same
[SPEAKER_00]: power or watts as traditional metal
halides or high pressure sodium grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lights with less heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are part of the reasons why they're
increased in popularity, not only the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum they produced, but the quality of
lights that they're able to have and the
[SPEAKER_00]: options growers have for bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the spectrum and wattages,
so the spectrum that they're producing is
[SPEAKER_00]: quite advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both of these lights emit traditional
PAR measured spectrum in addition to
[SPEAKER_00]: infrared and also UV spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: This full spectrum can make a visual plant
diagnosis easier for growers through their
[SPEAKER_00]: high color rendering index or CRI.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common CMH grow lights are the
315 watt grow lights and the 630 watt grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I mentioned this color rendering
index.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see an apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be kind of 100% in true color
rendering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see as we decrease that how
it starts to look a little off,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little not quite as red, not quite as
great contrast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very important for growers that
are looking at diagnosing or catching
[SPEAKER_00]: problems early.
[SPEAKER_00]: A higher CRI will make it much easier to
spot potential problems earlier when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: easier to correct them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as I mentioned, those 315 and those
630 watt options are commonly used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their recommended coverage area for each
is as follows.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a 315, you'll get a four by four veg
room or three by three in a flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using the larger kind of dual
bulb 630 watt, it'd be a five by five veg
[SPEAKER_00]: room coverage area or a four by four
flower room coverage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the CMH bulbs, so quality CMH bulbs
will last for about 20,000 hours and still
[SPEAKER_00]: retain about 80% or more of their initial
output.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, more specific spectrum
options are being offered by
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply do the increase in popularity of
the ballast to allow growers to simply
[SPEAKER_00]: change bulbs and not necessarily the
fixtures as their plants progress through
[SPEAKER_00]: the growing cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm not sponsored by them,
but these Phillips master color bulbs are
[SPEAKER_00]: highly regarded.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pay for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be on the more expensive
side, but definitely well worth it if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at the ultimate CMH bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now CMH for canvas and specific compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some bulbs available will have increase
in the UV light or far red spectrums,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can help increase the production of
certain compounds to help boost the
[SPEAKER_00]: overall quality and final cannabis
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: These bulbs can be used at the very end of
the growth cycle to maximize plant
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're really looking at maximizing
your potential harvest or particular
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds produced, these may be worth
investigating and utilizing as part of
[SPEAKER_00]: your CMH ballast to help make sure your
yield and your quality is as high as possible.
