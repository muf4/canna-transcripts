[SPEAKER_00]: In this video on Tobacco University,
we're going to be looking at growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in a grow tent compared to a grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's compare both of these
indoor spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, when we're talking about a
grow tent or grow room, they're both
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor growing areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while tents can be quite large,
in comparison, smaller indoor locations
[SPEAKER_00]: are grown in tents with larger plantings
are in grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, grow tents do offer the ability
to conduct isolated small scale
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments in isolated conditions and do
have their place, potentially thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about in general terms from male plants
with pollen trying to keep that in an
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated location.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be of special importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're talking about breeders
looking at isolating those male plants
[SPEAKER_00]: away from a male away from a main grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be advantageous for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of looking at conducting little
trials or different lighting sequences or
[SPEAKER_00]: something where we need control over the
conditions, grow tent maybe offer that
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity as well as growing full term
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the grow tents, what are
some of the advantages associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tents?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're a great way to get started
with cannabis production or any really any
[SPEAKER_00]: plant production as it allows for small
controlled environments and allows people
[SPEAKER_00]: the advantage of potentially having them
in small closets or areas that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: size limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also may create for isolated areas
for comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're trying to compare two different
things in one isolated environment for
[SPEAKER_00]: that, grow tents offer that advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also quick and easy to set up and
maintain a variety of general room
[SPEAKER_00]: environments for looking at having
potentially a veg grow tent and then a
[SPEAKER_00]: flower grow tent, maybe dry and cure grow
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It offers those advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages of grow tents
is simply they're small in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just a little size restrictive,
even the largest ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also have a high cost to plant
ratio because you have to support each the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual environment with all the
necessary equipment and they only alter
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment to some degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a grow tent in a room,
it's very hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been hard to sufficiently cool that
just as the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really cold might be hard to
sufficiently heat that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare that to a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages of a grow room is just
simply they're large area and the ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to regulate the room to match the
conditions of the plant and it allows for
[SPEAKER_00]: a very efficient plant production simply
because of the scale or the volume that's
[SPEAKER_00]: able to produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages with grow rooms
is that they can be costly to initially
[SPEAKER_00]: set up and it doesn't really allow for
plant isolations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you might kind of move them over to
one area or another, but for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: part, they're all in the same environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also lead to quick disease or
insect spread, especially if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: high plant density in a limited area here
of a grow room where we're looking at kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of everything being packed in despite its
large size.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant density is still very high here
and that can lead to some spread of
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, potentially quicker if those
plants are spaced out a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to weigh the options for your
indoor growing situation and decide
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you want to choose to grow in a
grow tent or a grow room.
Thank you.
Thank you.
