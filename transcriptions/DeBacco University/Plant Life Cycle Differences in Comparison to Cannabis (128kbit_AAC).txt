[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at different plant life cycle
differences in comparison to cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the focus of this lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the reason why I do it in comparison
to cannabis so you can be able to see and
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate some of the different life
cycles that other plants have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they make sure similarities and also
differences with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off there's three main
classifications for plant life cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one is an annual and they complete
their life cycle in one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: A perennial lives for three years or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a biannual is a flowering plant that
takes two years to complete its life
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's separated into a vegetative year
followed by a dormancy period and then
[SPEAKER_00]: leads into a reproductive portion of that
plant's life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis falls into the annual
category.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see how it kind of differs and
changes from these two other types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because cannabis is an annual plant,
it typically grows for one year and I put
[SPEAKER_00]: year in quotes here because I don't want
you to think year is 365 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this cannabis or annual year is able
to complete a full life cycle in this time
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as I said a year is not the 12 months
or 65 days especially for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The production of seeds is the marker end
of a completion of a life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to grow cannabis in much
less time than 12 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again the year or the annual plant year
is marked by the production of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this cannabis year, again in keeping
year in quotes, only limited amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis growers or breeders are looking
to produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by some definitions that final bud
contains no seeds but that is the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: that particular life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main goal is to produce unfertilized
flower because the amount of cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: will be much higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often plant cycle is completed in 12 weeks
or less, not 12 months, 12 weeks or less
[SPEAKER_00]: especially for indoor operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother or stock plants are kept longer but
these are only a select few individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing outdoors, so outdoor
growing, you want to refer to what's
[SPEAKER_00]: called the USDA plant hardiness zone map.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will tell you kind of in relation to
what plants or what can tolerate what can
[SPEAKER_00]: grow there or how long the growing season
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice elevation could impact this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Rocky Mountains are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Appalachian Mountains are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proximity to the coastline and large
bodies of water can also impact this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more important for outdoor growing
and you can see areas where it tends to be
[SPEAKER_00]: much colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis growing season is a crop cycle
and this typically is when growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis the goal is to overlap growing
seasons to ensure a continual harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor operations with supplemental
lighting can ensure consistent growing
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons to make the scheduling of end
products predictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of always want to have some
plants being propagated, some flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: drying and you kind of want to keep this
process continual instead of going through
[SPEAKER_00]: just one year and one crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now cannabis has a distinctive growing
cycle so knowing the natural cycle and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's required can allow for each portion
to be maximized for quick turnaround time
[SPEAKER_00]: and a high end quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible to force cannabis into
flower at any stage of growth but it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: small immature plant like this one if we
force this one into flower would not be an
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient method of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So developing this understanding of the
growth cycle that cannabis naturally takes
[SPEAKER_00]: on allows growers that have control over
photo periods to maximize the production
[SPEAKER_00]: or yield they're getting per plant trying
to keep costs down and yields high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
