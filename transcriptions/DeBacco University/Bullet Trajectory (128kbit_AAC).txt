[SPEAKER_00]: Here I want to go over bullet trajectory
and kind of a little bit of understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: about this, even though many factors come
into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to touch on a couple of them
just so you get an idea of factors that
[SPEAKER_00]: might influence how a bullet may travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off trajectory is the path of
bullet from the barrel to the point it
[SPEAKER_00]: hits the target.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to simple physics, the path will be a
parabola.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be curved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we like to think about it in a
straight line, it's actually curved.
[SPEAKER_00]: To what degree it's curved depends on a
couple of factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have something called line of sight
and line of departure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of have this example here where
we're looking at a target and a bullet
[SPEAKER_00]: being fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the line of sight is a straight line
that represented by the alignment of the
[SPEAKER_00]: front and rear sights of the firearm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this line of sight is a straight line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The line of departure is also a straight
line, but this kind of runs down the
[SPEAKER_00]: center of the bore of the firearm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're looking at, or a comparison
of how that bolt's actually going to
[SPEAKER_00]: travel, is here's the parabola path that
that bullet traveled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though it was fired here and ends
up here, this is the line of sight,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case it did have a parabolic path.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to take into
consideration the distance between where
[SPEAKER_00]: the bullet's leaving the barrel and
impacting the target.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one factor to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have these internal factors or
influence the bullet trajectory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the projectile velocity, most important
factor affecting the trajectory path.
[SPEAKER_00]: How quick is that bullet going?
[SPEAKER_00]: How quick is it spinning?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the angle of fire?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also things to take into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see here, given things equal,
changing the speed at that bullet travels
[SPEAKER_00]: vastly impacts the distance, having them
all being fired at the same angle in this
[SPEAKER_00]: example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now external factors that influence bullet
trajectory are gravity, drag, and wind
[SPEAKER_00]: force.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for comparison here, we could see how
all fire at the same angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have some different trajectories
and we could see some very different
[SPEAKER_00]: distances here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are trajectories of three objects
at the same angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black object doesn't experience any
form of drag and moves along parabola.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this shows the extreme example that if
there was no external factors kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: influencing, no drag I should say,
this is how far it would travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can see here, as an example of
the blue and the green, showing the impact
[SPEAKER_00]: of these potential drag factors and how
they can vastly decrease the distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there's also wind force to
consider and we kind of see air
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance, no air resistance,
target height.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these kind of factors play into the
final trajectory of that bullet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have projectile drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the effect of gravity and projectile in
flight is often referred to as projectile
[SPEAKER_00]: drop or bullet drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to understand the effect of
gravity when zeroing the site of
[SPEAKER_00]: components of a gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: To plan for a projectile drop and
compensate properly, it's important to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand a projectile travels in a
parabolic shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried to show this kind of water here
coming out of a water pump, going up and
[SPEAKER_00]: coming down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at trying to
estimate where the shooter may have been,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we have the endpoint and we have the
gun to kind of match up the sites,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have to keep in mind that that bullet
is traveling in a parabolic shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an extreme case here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the projectile drop graph just as kind
of putting the kind of visual to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a typical trajectory graph for an
M4 carbide rifle using cartridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see that there's two
different ones utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all fired at the same point and
the same angle, but we can see very
[SPEAKER_00]: differences here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both trajectories are identical at 25
meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the difference in muzzle velocity of
projectiles gradually causes the
[SPEAKER_00]: significant changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where knowing the caliber,
knowing the propellant that was used can
[SPEAKER_00]: again, help offer some suggestions here as
far as how far it may travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: In short distances, it may not have as
great of a change, but over long distances
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure, that change will be definitely
potentially significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that it's seen at a much
greater degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now gravity also influences, so a drop-in
bullet at the same time as the height
[SPEAKER_00]: firing can estimate the rate of drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's one that's being dropped,
here's one that's rolling off a counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see they both impact at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gravity is the same influence here,
whether it's traveling in its line or just
[SPEAKER_00]: being simply dropped in a vertical
pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ballistics table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a tool at which predicts a
trajectory of a projectile that's used to
[SPEAKER_00]: compensate for physical effects in order
to increase the probability of the
[SPEAKER_00]: projectile reaching the intended target.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just some basic tables for
looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wind table, how that might impact
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drop table, depending how far you're
shooting, depending on velocity,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on temperature, air pressure,
muzzle velocity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a lot of factors to take into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kind of going over the basics
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could kind of give you that kind of real
basic kind of form here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ideal projectile motion in different
angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, angle has a large play in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this just kind of gives this
kind of example of how we have different
[SPEAKER_00]: angles being fired and looking at
different timestamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these trajectories or projectiles
launch at different elevation angles in a
[SPEAKER_00]: speed of 10 meters per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your vacuuming uniformed downward gravity
field is assumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take those factors out and you could
see here just in general, little t's time
[SPEAKER_00]: from launch, big t's time of flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: R is range, H is the highest point of
trajectory.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of gives you this kind of
explanation of what these numbers here on
[SPEAKER_00]: this graph mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: The points are at 0.5 second intervals and
the length of their tails is very
[SPEAKER_00]: proportional to the speed to, again,
help visualize what's going on when
[SPEAKER_00]: bullets are fired at different angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have drag resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a mathematical model such as
computation fluid dynamics are used for
[SPEAKER_00]: estimating the effects of drag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can get very complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want you to know that drag
resistance is a factor to take into
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Empirical measures often offer the most
reliable method of determining flight
[SPEAKER_00]: trajectories.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to get super, super
specific, but just realize that the drag
[SPEAKER_00]: on the particular bullet needs to be taken
into consideration because it is a factor
[SPEAKER_00]: that's influencing where that bullet is
ultimately impacting the target.
