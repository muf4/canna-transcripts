[SPEAKER_00]: On this Tabaco University video,
I'm going to go over cannabis extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: options, how we can turn this into this,
and what process we may go through,
[SPEAKER_00]: or some advantages and disadvantages of
some of the processes to go through and
[SPEAKER_00]: turn cannabis buds into a final extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to go over some
cannabis extraction options, give you some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the advantages and disadvantages of
each.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's one you want to learn more
about, search this channel here on Tabaco
[SPEAKER_00]: University and you'll find more detailed
versions of that specific extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, why would you want to
extract in the first place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, extraction allows for purified
product from the cannabis plant that is
[SPEAKER_00]: showing increased popularity among
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extracts also offer more consistent dosing
than just using the dry flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different methods of extraction,
each with its own advantages and
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantages that we provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, just a quick advantage,
disadvantage of a water-based extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the advantages of the elimination of
additional sample cleanup, ease of
[SPEAKER_00]: automation and a cheap solvent because
it's basically using water.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages are the long
residence time of extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has increased risk of phytochemical
degradation as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if water extract is not for you,
then we've got rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage of rosin, it's a near pure
concentrated product that's produced,
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively simple and easy process with
minimal specialized equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the downfall is it does for at
least high pressure rosin, presses can be
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely dangerous if misused and it's
very easy to burn the extract if not
[SPEAKER_00]: properly pressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some stepwise protocols to
follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the distillation method of
extraction and this is an extremely pure
[SPEAKER_00]: product when compared to other extraction
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Complete control over terpenes and
flavonoids, easily automated and can
[SPEAKER_00]: really allow for very specific components
to be extracted and put into separate
[SPEAKER_00]: containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, as we can see here, this can be a
very costly and long process with multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it can take days to pass one
liter of crude oil through the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The distillation process strips the
cannabis of all compounds except for the
[SPEAKER_00]: desired compound, which can have dramatic
effect on the terpenes when adding them
[SPEAKER_00]: back into the mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that's one of the disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if these aren't the methods for you,
you might want to consider alcohol or
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol specific extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very cost effective for large
amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol extraction can pull a broader
range of compounds from the plant than
[SPEAKER_00]: other extraction methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no risk of leaving toxic residual
chemicals in the final cannabis extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages are that
ethanol has a much higher boiling point
[SPEAKER_00]: than other solvents, which could lead to a
longer process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post-processing is extensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several refinements must be made to the
extract before it's consumer ready and it
[SPEAKER_00]: can be extremely dangerous and a
significant fire hazard if being used
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethanol, alcohol in general, highly
flammable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to carbon dioxide extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is less valuable material is
wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a specific compounds with adjustments
to heat, pressure and runtime can be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no residual solvent in the
final product due to the evaporation of
[SPEAKER_00]: the carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is it's much higher
initial startup cost when compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: other extraction methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even once purchased, the equipment
requires proper training and safety
[SPEAKER_00]: procedures to be understood and followed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one you want to use caution if
you're going to be utilizing this
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction method.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one mentioned here is going to be
hydrocarbon extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This offers a wide range of extract types
and can be achieved through hydrocarbon
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can be done with trim and flour,
relative low equipment and run costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the downfall is extremely
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Butane, propane, highly flammable and
extreme caution must be used when
[SPEAKER_00]: extracting with hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unwanted compounds can make it tough for
the extraction process and would need a
[SPEAKER_00]: later refinement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if each or any one of these
extraction methods you want to learn more
[SPEAKER_00]: about, search the channel and hopefully
you can find some more detail as you
[SPEAKER_00]: continue your education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
