[SPEAKER_00]: Every cell needs to kind of produce energy
for an organism to be able to survive,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're going to look at some of those
organelles responsible for producing some
[SPEAKER_00]: of that energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In plants, we have most notably the
chloroplast, and then we have everyone's
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite, the mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, chloroplasts contain
chlorophyll, those green pigments that
[SPEAKER_00]: allow to capture solar energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see even with a light microscope,
you can easily pick them out and see them
[SPEAKER_00]: as they're very well-defined in the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now chloroplasts, what's unique about them
is that they are mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can actually change position to
maximize their ability to capture
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So top view here and kind of sideways
view.
[SPEAKER_00]: In dark environments, those chloroplasts
will move kind of towards the top so that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're able to try to maximize as much
light as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's too much light, they can
actually move to the side or kind of work
[SPEAKER_00]: their way through the cell, so a little
bit more diffused.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they want to maximize the light
absorption, they can actually move within
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these chloroplasts originated as
endosymbiotic cyanobacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they retain their own independent
genome, and there's some evidence to
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest they may have once been
free-living and are now, through the
[SPEAKER_00]: endosymbiotic theory, are now components,
particularly of plant cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now these chloroplasts have a triple
membrane structure, an outer and an inner
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: This again is part of the reason why the
theory is that they may have been once
[SPEAKER_00]: free-living because they already have a
membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: This siliquid forms disk-like structures,
which are stacked in the form of grata.
[SPEAKER_00]: These kind of stacks allow for a very
efficient surface area to volume ratio to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow for exchange of materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're suspended within the semi-fluid of
the stroma, which we can see here and also
[SPEAKER_00]: located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a lot of chemical reactions,
as I mentioned, so we want to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of surface area for them to
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a zoomed-in version here,
again, showing you kind of these like
[SPEAKER_00]: disks that are on top of one another,
allowing for that a lot of area for these
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical reactions to occur, which are
very important because we want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient with our energy production
within the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now chloroplasts are probably most
familiar with a process of the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic process, involved with
taking carbon dioxide, water with light
[SPEAKER_00]: energy, and producing sugars and oxygen as
a byproduct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only plants, algae, and certain bacteria
are capable of going through this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll and other pigments capture
solar energy, and enzymes are ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: used to synthesize carbohydrates or
sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this site of photosynthesis,
their carbohydrates are being formed from
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide and water, cells making its
own food using this carbon dioxide here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that kind of membrane here and
this exchange that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: This photon energy, this light energy,
is driving the breakdown of water,
[SPEAKER_00]: producing oxygen, these hydrogen ions,
which are ultimately being used to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: ATP and NADPH, both energy molecules,
and being used to synthesize or create
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that structure here, as I mentioned,
the stroma, the aqueous fluid,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see the thylakoid, we see the grana,
the thylakoid being the individual
[SPEAKER_00]: component, the grana being a stack of
those thylakoids, and the multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: membranes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the lumen, which is the kind
of semi-fluid area located within the
[SPEAKER_00]: thylakoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we get onto the mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's originated also as an endosymoic
eubacterium, since it has its own DNA and
[SPEAKER_00]: it has multiple layers, multiple
membranes, indicating it may have once
[SPEAKER_00]: been free of living.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mitochondria are smaller than a
chloroplast, and they contain ribosomes in
[SPEAKER_00]: their own DNA, and they remain an
independent genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's highly variable among species,
so that's kind of an interesting fact
[SPEAKER_00]: about the mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's involved in cellular respiration,
produces most of the ATP utilized by the
[SPEAKER_00]: cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say it's the powerhouse of
the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's really the site of cellular
respiration or the breaking down of sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: to form energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mitochondria is surrounded by this
double membrane, it's an outer and inner,
[SPEAKER_00]: much as we saw with the chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: These folds, again, allow for a lot of
surface area to volume ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cristae surrounds the matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: The matrix is the inner semi-fluid
containing respiratory enzymes,
[SPEAKER_00]: these proteins involved in this energy
production process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how they're generating that energy is
by breaking down carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This energy production that occurs is
fatty acid metabolism, there's also the
[SPEAKER_00]: Krebs cycle or the citric acid cycle,
and it's through the process of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: called oxidative phosphorylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're having all these components within
these membranes going through and
[SPEAKER_00]: isolating different components,
allowing them to create gradients to then
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately generate ATP, which is the
energy currency of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, as I said, that mitochondria,
it's the site of cellular respiration or
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the site of ATP synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The powerhouse just kind of cuts it a
little bit short for what it's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: able to produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a double membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of what they look like
looking at a transmission electron
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's cristae, there's folds in there,
there's enzymes in there help to break
[SPEAKER_00]: down of those carbohydrates and ultimately
producing ATP, which is the energy
[SPEAKER_00]: currency of all cells in vital for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that animal cells and plant
cells both have mitochondria, while plant
[SPEAKER_00]: cells and algae are the ones that only
have the chloroplasts.
