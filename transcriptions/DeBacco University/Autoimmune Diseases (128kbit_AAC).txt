[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm going to go over autoimmune
diseases here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you a brief definition
as well as point out some diseases that
[SPEAKER_00]: you may have heard of but did not know
that they were an autoimmune disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the definition of an
autoimmune disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens during this is cytotoxic T
cells and B cells lose their ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: distinguish self cells from non self
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result from this, the body actually
starts attacking its own tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a reminder, in a normal immune
response, we have antigens that invade,
[SPEAKER_00]: our body builds up antibodies to form
against them, and the antibodies remove
[SPEAKER_00]: the invading antigens.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, the antibodies remain and
protect themselves for the long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a normal case.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in an autoimmune disease,
our immune system forms antibodies to self
[SPEAKER_00]: antigens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The antibodies attack self antigens and as
a result, the body has a high degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation and tissue damage that
occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically the body attacking itself
instead of being directed with a high
[SPEAKER_00]: degree of specificity to foreign antigens
that are invading the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a couple examples of autoimmune
diseases that you may have heard before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but may not have connected to autoimmune
diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple listed here, multiple
sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid
[SPEAKER_00]: arthritis are just some examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's over 100 autoimmune diseases and I
want you to realize that they affect many
[SPEAKER_00]: different components of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not just isolated to one region or
one type of tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, autism, multiple sclerosis is
involved with the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leukemia is involved with the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our Celiac and Crohn's disease
with the GI tract, fibromyalgia with the
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs, rheumatoid arthritis with the
bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all examples of autoimmune
diseases with the same basic principle
[SPEAKER_00]: where the body is unable to distinguish
self from non-self and as a result,
[SPEAKER_00]: sadly, ends up attacking its own tissues
causing inflammation, damage, and as a
[SPEAKER_00]: result, many different types of diseases.
Thank you.
