[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to learn about the
plant hormone called auxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like on the chemical
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the ball and stick model here,
but we're going to learn about how it
[SPEAKER_00]: influences and impacts plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting first, auxin can move through
the plant from the site of initial
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It moves through the process of active
transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it can diffuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a hormone that can diffuse through
plant cells, but it only diffuses at a
[SPEAKER_00]: rate of about a centimeter per hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when auxin is transported through
active transport, it's much faster,
[SPEAKER_00]: about 10 times as fast, meaning it can
move 10 centimeters per hour, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see our auxin moving down here through
the process of active transport,
[SPEAKER_00]: moving those proteins embedded in the cell
wall through the cell membrane here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's using ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is an energy investment for the
plant, but this is advantageous because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's able to get that auxin throughout its
system much faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the tortoise and the hare
example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diffusion would be the tortoise,
and active transport would be the hare in
[SPEAKER_00]: this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's auxin do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's got a couple of functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has some secondary actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is root initiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another is vascular tissue
de-differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three is tropic response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four is apical dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And five is the development of axillary
buds, flowers, and fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to talk to each about these
in a little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, again, the hormone here,
auxin, that we're going to be talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with promoting rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as we see here, here's an example of
some cuttings taken with no auxin applied,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can see the root development on
them is quite poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: When auxin is applied, though,
we see a much more advantageous root
[SPEAKER_00]: formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here also a comparison of different
parts per million of a particular auxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: At zero, we see hardly any root formation,
and as we increase our auxin levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see an increase in the rooting
percentage in total.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, IVA is a type of auxin, and we're
seeing here the same kind of increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: rooting from initially no auxin added.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what's interesting here is that
two grams per liter, we see more roots
[SPEAKER_00]: than at 16 grams per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as it kind of shows here is our rooting
increases to a certain point and then
[SPEAKER_00]: plateaus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can even, if we increase auxin
concentrations too much, it can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: cause a slight decrease in our rooting
that we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more is not better in auxins,
but definitely some is better than none as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as increasing our rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many products that are used to
promote these lateral buds of roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say, to form, and we notice here
that hormidin is a very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hormidin 1, 2, and 3 refer to different
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clon-X is another form of an IVA here that
you can apply to plantations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with both of these, auxins in general
might be a little unstable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to keep those products stored in
the fridge at cool temperatures to make
[SPEAKER_00]: the auxin last as long as possible so it
should be as effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, auxin plays a role in diffraction of
vascular tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if there's a wound site,
auxin will be involved here to
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiate tissue to repair a vascular
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see here a little bit,
this is highlighted on the vascular
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, xylem and nerflom, and auxin
plays a role in cells differentiating into
[SPEAKER_00]: those particular vascular tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one here, so we notice that auxin is
involved with tropic responses,
[SPEAKER_00]: and tropism refers to growth in response
to a stimulus.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's light in the sense of sunlight,
water, where the waters might be located,
[SPEAKER_00]: roots want to maybe go towards that,
and gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how roots know to go down and
shoots know to come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here is our light response here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's important here in the light
response, we see in this case these two
[SPEAKER_00]: plants bending towards the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while this does occur, this occurs
because of auxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here in the first image here,
the light is right above the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and here's our auxin concentration,
it's pretty even.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, now as that light source is a
little bit more to the side here,
[SPEAKER_00]: notice our plant kind of starting to bend
over towards the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's happening, in order for the
plant to bend like that, the cells on one
[SPEAKER_00]: side need to basically get bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So auxin concentrations increase,
causing these cells to get larger,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these elongation of cells cause the
plant to bend, because you have basically
[SPEAKER_00]: the same area on each side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if one side gets longer,
we're noticing that that side that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get longer is going to start to push
over and bend towards the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could think of this if you're running
around a track.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the outer circle is a little bit longer
distance than on the inner circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, with this elongation of cells,
this is a little bit longer, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to cause the plant to bend towards
the light, and that's what you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we see the plant bending towards
the light, that's actually because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone auxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's apical dominance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Apical dominance is an inhibitory
influence on the apical bud upon lateral
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first, our apical bud is at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lateral buds are on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a plant that has strong apical
dominance would be an example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a strong triangle kind of shape,
strong kind of sense of that central bud
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weak apical dominance is this kind of
weeping tree, where we don't see a point,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't see a point, don't see kind of
the middle part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have that nice symmetrical
shape here, very weak apical dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also involved in poinsettia
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look very carefully at a
poinsettia, that's a large bush-like form
[SPEAKER_00]: that looks more like this, you'll notice
in the center, there's pinch points.
[SPEAKER_00]: These apical dominance, these leading
shoots have been pinched, and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: causing this lateral bud formation to
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this inhibitory influence on the apical
bud upon lateral buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we have a normally growing
plant here, that actively growing bud tip
[SPEAKER_00]: has a lot of auxin in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shoot tip is a source of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That inhibits lateral buds from forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our developing buds,
and they're kind of kept in that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: slow development dormant-like state.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we pinch the top of that,
we're removing the auxin, and now with the
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced amount of auxin, there's no more
suppression to those lateral buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we see these lateral buds being
growing at a much greater rate than they
[SPEAKER_00]: are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evident here, we see our auxiliary buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we pinch that top portion off,
these will be encouraged to grow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if we pinch the top off,
we notice the lateral buds grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when we pinch the top off and if we
add auxin, supplemental auxin,
[SPEAKER_00]: we notice that those lateral buds never
develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a way to prove that auxin is the
one suppressing lateral bud formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a plant naturally breaks the tip off
because of wind or animals come along and
[SPEAKER_00]: eat it, that's gonna remove the auxin,
and that's gonna cause these lateral buds
[SPEAKER_00]: to sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, under normal conditions,
the plant doesn't wanna compete with all
[SPEAKER_00]: these leaves, so it's just gonna maintain
that central shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auxin promotes fruit development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as seeds mature, they release auxin to
the surrounding parts which develop into
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit that covers the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are normal fruit, and we see
little seeds here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we take out those seeds,
we notice that the strawberry here doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: grow nearly as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if we take the little seeds off
and we spray it with auxins, we get
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat of return to normal, not quite
100% because it's interacting with other
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones, but we see a much closer
resemblance of the normal fruit than if we
[SPEAKER_00]: just take the seeds off, limiting the
auxin from developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here, evidence of the role of auxin
in the formation of fruit and structures
[SPEAKER_00]: with similar functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, here's our normal strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's if we take all the seeds away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this trial run is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens if we take a band of those
seeds off, just a central kind of equator
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice the fruit below that point does
not develop normally, but the fruit above
[SPEAKER_00]: that does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without seed formation, fruits do not
develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Developing seeds are a source of auxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just gives a little bit of an
example showing you normal conditions and
[SPEAKER_00]: how the influence or dependence on fruit
development that auxin plays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, auxins or synthetic auxins are
actually a weed killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while auxin as a plant hormone can help
plants develop, synthetic auxins have a
[SPEAKER_00]: way of potentially eliminating plants from
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as many synthetic auxins are used as
selective weed killers or herbicides,
[SPEAKER_00]: this one called 2,4-D is used to destroy
broadleaf weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not affect mature monocots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It causes plants to grow itself to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it grows so fast that it can't
support itself and it actually will kill
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: More readily absorbed in broadleaf plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on certain weed killers, you may see
them advertised as kills weeds but not the
[SPEAKER_00]: grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because it's got 2,4-D.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a type of synthetic auxin and it's a
selective broadleaf weed control,
[SPEAKER_00]: selected in the sense that it's going to
target mainly dicots where monocots will
[SPEAKER_00]: not be as affected by this, especially if
they're mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that was helpful to help explain
a little bit of the hormone auxin and how
[SPEAKER_00]: it can influence plant growth.
Thank you.
