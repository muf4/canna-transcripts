[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm going to give you a brief
overview of the digestive system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This image here shows a great summary of
the organs involved and also their
[SPEAKER_00]: orientation in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: This image here gives you the same
orientation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you a little bit more description
for some of these areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to have a general sense
of what's occurring where and what the
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary functions are of some of these
essential organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why do we consume food?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we consume food to gain energy and a
healthy diet contains more carbohydrates
[SPEAKER_00]: than fats.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also contains lots of proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may remember from macromolecules,
carbohydrates are important for storage of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy, but also provide energy,
quicker energy that can be that simple
[SPEAKER_00]: monosaccharides of the sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proteins make up much of the structure of
cells and also can speed up chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: reactions in the form of enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lipids are for long-term storage of
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the food pyramid indicating items
at the top we should be consuming less of,
[SPEAKER_00]: items at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be consuming more of,
but you can see the foundation is based in
[SPEAKER_00]: daily exercise and weight control for a
healthy lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, oftentimes we hear in the
news about someone being obese or the
[SPEAKER_00]: obesity epidemic and the percentage of
people being obese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how is that determined?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's determined through the body mass
index and that's abbreviated BMI.
[SPEAKER_00]: In short, what it does is it compares
someone's weight to someone's height.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could kind of get an idea where you
may fall for your BMI based on your weight
[SPEAKER_00]: in pounds and your height here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, both metrics in US customary
are provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're welcome to pause the video and
see where you fall in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, essential substances for
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do consume food, but we have some
essential substances for growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many vertebrates aren't able to
manufacture one or more of the 20 amino
[SPEAKER_00]: acids needed to make proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while there's only 20 total,
humans are unable to synthesize eight of
[SPEAKER_00]: those 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple listed here, leucine,
lysine, phenylalanine, valine are
[SPEAKER_00]: essential because those must be obtained
through the food, meaning our body cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacture these.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, we cannot synthesize certain
polyunsaturated fats and we also need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be consuming trace elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a trace element, there's a couple
listed here, they are required in small
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing that we need in large amounts,
but they are essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So iodine, zinc, manganese are just a
couple examples here of trace elements
[SPEAKER_00]: that are important for our body to
function properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, vitamins, essential organic
substances required also in small amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And humans require at least 13 different
vitamins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vitamin C or absorbic acid, if not
obtained in the diet, the disease scurvy
[SPEAKER_00]: will develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just gives you an idea of some of
the importance of some of these components
[SPEAKER_00]: that are essential for growth and may not
be needed in large amounts, but are needed
[SPEAKER_00]: at least in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on our digestive system
function to acquire nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have the ability to break down
substances here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrolysis, catalyzm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening here is large molecules
are being broken down into small ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is being consumed in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is releasing energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrolysis, using water to lyse or break
apart molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: This releases energy, typically without
oxidation reactions and glycolysis would
[SPEAKER_00]: be needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using raw materials to synthesize
essential components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dehydration synthesis is the process here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small molecules are assembled into large
ones and water is produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dehydration and water is being lost here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It uses energy to construct new bonds and
typically involves reduction reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting it all together here, catalyzm in
our anabolic reactions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have our two different pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just remember, we're catalyzing
something here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're breaking it apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we are putting things together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a way to put things
together, there's also a way to break
[SPEAKER_00]: things apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're seeing our carbohydrates or
sugars broken down into glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glucose can be assembled into starch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a complex glucose chain of
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the same thing here, fats being broken
down, proteins being broken down into
[SPEAKER_00]: amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see citric acid cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see fatty acids being assembled into
more complex fats and phospholipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, it's a very complex
system that our body has.
[SPEAKER_00]: To simplify it a little bit more,
there's mechanical and chemical digestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mechanical and chemical digestion of food
takes place in many steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beginning in the mouth and ending in the
rectum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this provides another quick summary of
where mechanical and chemical digestion
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs in the different regions of the
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good to kind of review that and have an
idea of what's being broken down where.
[SPEAKER_00]: In digestion, it handles each nutrient
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not just one pathway we can run
all nutrients through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have enzymatic hydrolysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, taking our more complex molecules
and breaking them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see proteins into amino acids,
carbohydrates into monosaccharides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nucleic acid into nucleobases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lipids ultimately into fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be reabsorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the liver playing a very important
role here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the lymphatic system here with
blood, fiber, and cellulose being broke
[SPEAKER_00]: down into feces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large molecules are digested before
absorption occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to break them apart before we
can absorb them in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some can be absorbed without processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many require special transport for
this to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: In digestion, the breaking of molecular
bonds into large organic molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbohydrates, proteins, lipids,
and nucleic acids are our main
[SPEAKER_00]: macromolecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Process called hydrolysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's divided into target classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking here, we see proteases,
amylase, nuclease, lipase.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these are enzymes breaking things
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nuclease breaks down nucleic acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amylase breaks down starch or
carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protease breaks down proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light paste breaks down fats for lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see an example also here of
what's occurring in the esophagus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stomach, the liver, the pancreas,
and the small intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that pancreas, which we may not be
familiar with, does have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: important enzymes to be released there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as many in the stomach as some people
may think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pancreas is very important for releasing
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, here's our general digestive
system overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple key points that you should be
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mouth, the pharynx, the esophagus,
the stomach, the small intestine,
[SPEAKER_00]: the large intestine, and the rectum.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are each of these involved in the
elementary canal, and what accessory
[SPEAKER_00]: organs are doing, and how they're
important for a normal function digestive system.
