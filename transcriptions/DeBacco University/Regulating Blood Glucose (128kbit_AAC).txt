[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at how the body
goes about regulating blood glucose levels
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to maintain homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How the body goes about doing this is the
pancreas is involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's responsible for monitoring blood
glucose levels, specifically the islet of
[SPEAKER_00]: Langerhans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we say homeostasis, this doesn't
mean everything's a complete flat line.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be continuous fluctuations,
but they will occur within narrow limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, when glucose levels are high,
insulin will be released.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the levels are low, glucagon will be
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a nice graph here where we're
looking at our blood glucose levels in red
[SPEAKER_00]: and our insulin levels here in this
bluish-purple color.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that there are fluctuations
throughout the day, but overall,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is kept in a very tight range so our
body can go about maintaining homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at this in a pictorial sense,
we have our pancreas here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: One could be low blood sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our bodies want to increase our blood
sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glucagon will be released, promoting
glycogen breakdown in the liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, if we have high blood
sugar, we're going to want to decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: that blood sugar, and we're going to do
that with insulin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insulin is going to do two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to promote glycogen synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also going to stimulate glucose
uptake in tissue cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, that will lead to a decrease in
our blood sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we have that high blood glucose,
we call it hyperglycemia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here would be our normal blood sugar
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We consume orange juice or something that
has a lot of sugar, and now we are in a
[SPEAKER_00]: hypoglycemia state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insulin is going to be released by beta
cells in the pancreas, and that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: initiate three things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insulin's effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, it's going to trigger body cells
that take up glucose from blood and
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize it in cellular respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also going to inhibit two processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glycogenolysis is one where glucose is
removed from the blood and stored in
[SPEAKER_00]: glycogen in the liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to inhibit that step.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also going to inhibit amino acids and
glycerols that are not converted to
[SPEAKER_00]: glucose in the ER.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you may remember from macromolecules
rough and smooth ER, this is glucogenesis
[SPEAKER_00]: that will be also inhibited in a
hyperglycemic state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, we're trying to get rid of
some of this blood sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to store it, so the body's
going to go through and help trigger these
[SPEAKER_00]: events to help reduce blood glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, we have our
hemostasis, and then we have low blood
[SPEAKER_00]: glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, glucogenolysis is going to be
released by the alpha cells in the
[SPEAKER_00]: pancreas, and that's basically going to do
the opposite of what we just saw in that
[SPEAKER_00]: hyperglycemic state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where insulin stimulates, this is going to
inhibit, and where insulin inhibited,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is going to stimulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically the reverse of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole goal here is to have blood
glucose concentration increase to get us
[SPEAKER_00]: up to this range here after our
hyperglycemic state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at this, where we look at both
parts together, we can see that here,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we have our stimulus of blood
glucose levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a cupcake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beta cells in the pancreas release our
insulin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That insulin signals the liver to take up
glucose and store it as glycogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our body cells will also take up glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, blood glucose levels will
decline, reaching homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a period of time of blood glucose
levels fall, alpha cells in the pancreas
[SPEAKER_00]: will release glucagon, and the liver will
break down the glucagon to release
[SPEAKER_00]: glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, blood glucose levels will rise,
helping us maintain this homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this kind of feedback system
makes sense and helps develop a better
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of how the body maintains
blood glucose levels to keep homeostasis
[SPEAKER_00]: and allow the normal functions of the body
to continue.
