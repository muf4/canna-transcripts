[SPEAKER_00]: When looking at setting up a hydroponic
system, there will be some equipment that
[SPEAKER_00]: will be needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the specifics of the equipment that
you need will depend on your exact system
[SPEAKER_00]: chosen, but there are some things that are
true just about for all systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the minimum equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, while there can be variability,
it would be a water monitor of some kind
[SPEAKER_00]: that will allow you to read the
temperature, the EC or PPM, and pH as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you need a quality water source or
to be able to make a quality water source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And precise measuring equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that water monitor, Blue Lab Guardian,
is pictured here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to always know the current
conditions of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH is important, but so is the EC and
temperature, and that's why I like this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of all in one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows for continual checking and
monitoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good habit to get into,
to always have this kind of reading that
[SPEAKER_00]: and always making sure the numbers are
where you expect them to be or within the
[SPEAKER_00]: range you expect them to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here the PPM is a little high,
but temperature looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pH also looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also wireless systems that can
allow you to check on conditions remotely,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you don't even have to be in the room,
but can also sometimes give you alerts if
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain parameter has gone over or under
to give you that indication without you
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly having to check it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, quality water source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to know how your native
water tests, meaning what do you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: do to modify that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important also to recheck whatever
source you're using over time to get an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just test it once and assume it's
always like that throughout the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Determine if you need to invest in a
filtration system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's best to meet the native water
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you have high salts or
high water, an RO or reverse osmosis
[SPEAKER_00]: system might be advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a lot of particulate present,
a sediment filter, if you have chlorine
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of tap water, a carbon filter
may be your best option or a combination
[SPEAKER_00]: of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your measure equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: With hydroponics, it's very important to
be exact with the nutrients you're adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, looking at these graduates
cylinders, there will be this little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of this kind of bend to the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the meniscus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always want to be reading the value at
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this water does come up a little bit
here and here, this would be a 40 unit
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to use the bottom of that what's
called the meniscus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having quality measure equipment is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get different gradations here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are graduated cylinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beakers are not very accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always make sure you're cleaning these
before and after you use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless of what nutrients you are
adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't estimate, know the value,
and be sure you're adding that amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check to confirm with your water monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure there's pH and SPPMs are hovering
around where you need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double check to make sure you didn't over
or under add your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
