[SPEAKER_00]: If there's one thing growers can use
continually improvement and experience
[SPEAKER_00]: with, it's diagnosing plant problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very important skill, and I
encourage everyone to continue to work on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never really perfect, it's always
different, you're never sure exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: the answer may be in some cases,
but it's something you should still
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that diagnosis thing, the process we
go through here, I'm going to do a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: examples, applies and gets you at least to
get you an idea what you may have,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can start developing a plan around
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to say, oh, the plant died,
and move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to try to determine what caused
that plant to die, as you can better plan
[SPEAKER_00]: for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're trying to diagnose a problem,
or trying to help someone else diagnose a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem, first thing to do is you're
trying to get a correct diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to make assumptions,
because if you're trying to get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: root of that problem, or the real basic
cause to that, try not to make
[SPEAKER_00]: assumptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key is to continually ask questions of
yourself, or a person you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: help, that continually questions,
because someone may see four, and someone
[SPEAKER_00]: may see three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to make any quick
assumptions, you want to kind of look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the situation, and just collect some facts
and some data, before you start going
[SPEAKER_00]: through and saying, oh, that is X,
Y, or Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part is you want to try to
classify the problem, and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about each of these in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's a fungi that caused the
problem, a bacteria, a virus, water,
[SPEAKER_00]: an animal, yourself, the grower,
the environment, classifying the problem
[SPEAKER_00]: can really do a lot, as far as helping you
prevent that issue, or correcting that
[SPEAKER_00]: issue, moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very common control by fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, oddly enough, fungicides control
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to thrive in warm, moist,
and environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically, your mildews, your powdery
mildews, is a good example of a fungi that
[SPEAKER_00]: you may see very commonly occur,
and it likes those kind of warm,
[SPEAKER_00]: moist conditions, those heavy rains,
those heavy dews, warm temperatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause these to really get growing quite
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacteria is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to favor warm weather,
to the point of hot weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can multiply faster as the
temperature rises.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the problem becomes increasingly an
issue, as the temperature gets warmer and
[SPEAKER_00]: warmer, as the season warms up,
it could be a bacterial disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungicides, remember, don't work on
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungi and bacteria are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a bactericide to combat bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you apply a fungicide and it doesn't
really work, it may not be because the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicide's broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not be because you don't have a
fungus to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are typically insect vectored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants lack an immune system, so you
cannot control the actual substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't control the actual virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to prevent the vector from
bringing that virus in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So insect control and clean equipment are
very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is tobacco mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a very unique look to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a little bit more of a common
cold virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be used to seeing, but viruses
are very tough because plants lack the
[SPEAKER_00]: immune system, so we want to prevent the
virus from even coming into our fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrient imbalance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can be pH-related and or an over
or under application of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under application means that plants are
starving, for a particular nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over application means you could be
blocking certain nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically it's a field or crop-wide
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH concerns tend to show up early in the
season if it's kind of nutrient imbalance
[SPEAKER_00]: that relates to the pH problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrients tend to show up more at
fruit set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not always the case, but just
indications that you may have this
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient problem going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a citrus crop having some
nutrient imbalance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a corn plant, corn plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I said it's kind of field or
crop-wide, in this case that's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see these corn plants in the back doing
quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The corn here kind of have that yellowing
appearance there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, not always true, but when we see
this one doing well, one not doing well,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably not disease-oriented at least,
probably nutrient-oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it could be water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much or too little, same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much water could be over-irrigation,
could be a leaky hose, could be just
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive rain, or it could be too little.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to know how the water flows
through your field.
[SPEAKER_00]: The example here, you can see probably
where the water kind of collects and
[SPEAKER_00]: certain plant species can help indicate
where it could be wetter soil and where
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't expect good yields here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might as well make a walking path or
split two fields in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to check your irrigation line for
leaks or clogs because that can lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: too much or too little water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insects, kind of a neat image right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other variable, each one's got their own
little special properties, but each has
[SPEAKER_00]: its main time frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: They show up, a good idea of when to
expect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Degree days can help predict this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very important for some insects,
if you're looking at monitoring and
[SPEAKER_00]: developing control measures, degree days
can help you predict and time your
[SPEAKER_00]: applications and your scouting
accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animals, they can be really small like
nematodes, which I think often get
[SPEAKER_00]: overlooked, to very large, such as deer or
even in some case bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to determine what animals
likely to be in your area, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: deer, deer fence, you could use electric
fence for small animals like chipmunks and
[SPEAKER_00]: squirrels.
[SPEAKER_00]: In nematodes, a little bit harder and you
want to work on controlling them
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially in the soil if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental, it's kind of hard to plan
for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it might be obvious, hail damage,
temperature extremes can cause cracking,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case a tree trunk, or wind damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tropical storms or hurricanes,
these are just things maybe you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: control, but at least can identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hail's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a distant field, where you don't
get to see every day, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: see the hail, or it could not hail at the
home, but at the field it could.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just things to consider and not say,
oh, hail's kind of obvious once you see
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some fields are distant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one is grower error.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can be the hardest to see or realize
or admit to, that you messed up here,
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like a grower may have applied an
herbicide or they shouldn't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be realistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find growers rightfully so,
don't want to admit to something that they
[SPEAKER_00]: may have done, but by looking at the data
and collecting it, the key part is just to
[SPEAKER_00]: realize what you did, and don't do that
again.
Thank you.
