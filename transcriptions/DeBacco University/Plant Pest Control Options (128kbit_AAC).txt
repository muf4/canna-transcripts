[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're investigating some plant pest
control options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I say plant pest, you may jump
to a conclusion and think maybe an insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others may think of like a mouse as being
a pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all following the same
classification of plant pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with any plant pest, diagnosis is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing the exact pest to the greatest
degree of certainty is advantageous
[SPEAKER_00]: because control depends on the problem,
which is why proper diagnosis is
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a small, micro-based,
and that's going to set the steps into
[SPEAKER_00]: motion for what you're going to carry out
going forward so that you're using the
[SPEAKER_00]: resources you have most efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is organic better?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at plant pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those issues with organic are OMRI or USDA
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are your typical, touted as your
organic standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic does not mean no spray,
so I don't want you to think that just
[SPEAKER_00]: because something's organic doesn't mean
it wasn't sprayed with anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: This simply means that products can be
applied or from an approved list as
[SPEAKER_00]: considered to have less harmful impacts on
the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, organic growers can still pollute
even if they follow these organic rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just important to keep in mind
that knowing the grower, knowing where the
[SPEAKER_00]: food's coming from, knowing where the
plant material's coming from is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it's organic doesn't mean,
again, that there's no spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means that the sprays are from a
more scrutinized list that's thought to be
[SPEAKER_00]: more environmentally friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, all those sprays, there's two
different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a systemic or contact product
classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: The systemic circulate within the plant
vascular system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you spray it in one area, we see three
droplets here, and it spreads internally
[SPEAKER_00]: through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can allow for a more complete plant
protection and can suppress disease after
[SPEAKER_00]: it's initially infected the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an advantage with systemics.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, because they enter through the
plant, these are typically discouraged for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production because it can get
into the buds and leave internal residues,
[SPEAKER_00]: which when smoked or brought to high
temperatures can reach volatiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why they're typically
discouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opposite of that is called contacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They must be applied actually to the
causal agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they must come in direct contact or
where the disease will start.
[SPEAKER_00]: These products only kill what they touch,
so complete and even coverage is
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking at applying the
contact product, it's not going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: systemically through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, three droplets,
if it was a contact, would only kill areas
[SPEAKER_00]: in the three specific areas where it
touches the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: More even control is definitely more
advantageous for contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage is it doesn't offer any
residuals in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is it's on the applicator
to ensure even coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how fungicides work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungicides are grouped into their modes of
action.
[SPEAKER_00]: We move it MOA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often it's referred as FRAC codes and it
stands for Fungicide Resistance Action
[SPEAKER_00]: Committee Code.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this basically means is that
depending on how the fungicide may work is
[SPEAKER_00]: how it's classified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is important for growers to
rotate modes of action to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of fungus becoming resistant to
applied fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you rotate fungicides, but they're the
same mode of action, you're really not
[SPEAKER_00]: rotating anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's biological controls and this
consists of using natural enemies to
[SPEAKER_00]: control the pest population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, with white fly,
which is a common greenhouse pest,
[SPEAKER_00]: the tiny wasp, that's a natural enemy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eggs of the wasp will be placed in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Populated with white flies and they will
seek out the white fly larvae and attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a great way to use one
insect to help control another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because you're using a insect,
this is the biology using a living
[SPEAKER_00]: organism to control another living
organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultural controls are comprised of many
practices, but choosing plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to disease and insects is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they may have natural defenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where learning a cultivar is very
important for an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing what might be more resilient to
certain diseases or common pressures is
[SPEAKER_00]: also good information to document.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for physical controls, we're looking
at adding a physical substance,
[SPEAKER_00]: a physical prevention method.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be sand or rice hulls on the
surface to reduce gnats commonly found on
[SPEAKER_00]: that upper area of the soil where there's
a high moisture content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting these substances that drain very
easily, keep it dry, can help prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also physical control could be insect
netting, creating a physical barrier
[SPEAKER_00]: between the insects and the plants you're
trying to protect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemical controls utilize chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds pretty easy to reduce pest
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this includes the pesticides,
traps, also sex hormones, attractants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and plant growth regulators all fall under
the chemical control aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticides are the most dangerous means of
pest control in terms of risks to humans
[SPEAKER_00]: and the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep in mind that chemical
control, be mindful of what particular
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical because it can have a very
varying risks to not only the applicator,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, screening chemists for
contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the number one reason for product
rejection is pesticide residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Limitations for testing is because you
simply cannot test for chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically you have to test for a
particular chemical that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: suspected to be on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why are many fungicides forbidden from
chemist production?
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned before, this chemist is
commonly smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can cause chemicals to be changed
into volatiles and that could become
[SPEAKER_00]: aerosols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which can change the chemical profile and
potentially make it more hazardous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at just the general graph here,
looking at the total number of targeted
[SPEAKER_00]: samples of domestic imported foods tested
for pesticide residue by the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that overall testing,
even food items, has gone down simply
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the sheer volume that it takes
and the difficulty to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for cannabis held to a little bit of a
higher level, simply because it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: being consumed, there's that chance where
those chemicals could be turned into
[SPEAKER_00]: volatiles, which could be more harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're plain residues if they were
just consumed orally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just, again, things to keep in mind
when looking at different options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be looking at the bigger
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to just spray something to
control pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to think about the long-term
implications to make sure your product is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to pass screening and held to high
standards so that there's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination of the product and your
potential recipients.
