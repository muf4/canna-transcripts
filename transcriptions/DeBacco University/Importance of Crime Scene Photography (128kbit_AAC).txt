[SPEAKER_00]: Photography is very important for crime
scene investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're the head person responsible for
taking photographs, that's extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're someone that's involved,
being able to take good photographs is
[SPEAKER_00]: also a very important skill to have
because it would be very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you do not need the most expensive of
camera gear or equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go over some of the key
photographs you need to be considering or
[SPEAKER_00]: taking when investigating a crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the basic rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never move an object before photographing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this doesn't mean you just take one
quick picture and move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to take it from multiple
angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be looking at multiple zoom-ins,
multiple areas you might be photographing
[SPEAKER_00]: again, depending what that object may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you don't deem it important to
begin with, it's very important to take
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures before you move it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key thing to remember, when in doubt,
take a photograph, especially now with the
[SPEAKER_00]: digital age of photographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carry your extra memory cards,
make sure you've got plenty of space,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just take a lot of pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now photograph advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why we take a lot of pictures
is it's a quick method of documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very accurate, generates interest,
and can be used as evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Digital images can be enhanced and also
stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be careful on how far we
enhance them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the key part is they can be stored for
long periods of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be backed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all important, especially if a
crime scene gets reinvestigated later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the age of digital photography,
it could be the larger cameras,
[SPEAKER_00]: or even just phones as well, in some way
documenting that, what was seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the disadvantages, though,
of photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not all pros.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be altered.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you want to be careful of
modifying them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distortion is possible, and perspective
can add an influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to create a scene that,
through modifications, that didn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nor do we want to just capture one thing
without maybe taking into account
[SPEAKER_00]: something else that occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not perfect, but they are
definitely a major piece that's expected
[SPEAKER_00]: of documentation for crime scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perspective is everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned this, where we've got to be
careful on how we take pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking like the baby has large feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person holding the plane is really
just coming in for a landing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look quick here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look like he has pig's feet and properly
placed flags here off of the swimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perspective is everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to be mindful, not just
focusing maybe on one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be focused on the entire scene
to make sure we're not causing some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of false story or false depiction of what
might be going on in that image.
[SPEAKER_00]: So types of photographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have establishing photographs,
medium-range photographs, close-up,
[SPEAKER_00]: and macroscopic photographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of going to break those down,
and kind of they're all represented right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we want to establish the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get to an area where maybe
someone came in this doorway.
[SPEAKER_00]: A close-up so that it may have occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be more of a macroscopic view of
maybe the details of what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that establishing photograph depicts an
overall view of the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can include a broad shot,
the buildings, the approach, the escape
[SPEAKER_00]: routes, witnesses, and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to be focusing on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just gives you an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: This looks like a high school here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a car nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to be focusing on the
doorway here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it kind of gives us an idea of,
OK, maybe someone could pull up here very
[SPEAKER_00]: easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's park benches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it could have been witnesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the front of the school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of establishes the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting a little bit closer, as I said,
we're focusing on that door in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the medium-range photograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows the relationship between objects
with the concentration on the immediate
[SPEAKER_00]: scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just shows the relationship of evidence
in a given space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we're focused on the door,
now that we're a little bit closer,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see that there's some sort of
water hose here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could have played into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone could have tripped on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone could have moved that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be soil that's left behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be some sort of movement,
some sort of trace elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or else there's a door's prop to open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe there could be fingerprints on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the close proximity here to a
corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this all gives us ideas and that
relationship of how these objects may
[SPEAKER_00]: interrelate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to close-up photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: This depicts a single item as evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes these are included from
multiple angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're seeing the door propped up
with this piece of wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could take it from another angle,
taking it, but we're really focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: just that one piece of evidence there that
maybe this was added by someone to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: allow for easy access in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other are macroscopic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, not microscopic, macroscopic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an extreme close-up of very small
objects in which the size of the subject
[SPEAKER_00]: in the photograph is greater than life
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking just as an example
of a fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a lot of great details that's
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great for this evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This type of photograph is evidence for
showing that fine detail, the fine
[SPEAKER_00]: wispiness, the fine hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can really get at something that might be
needed as trace evidence, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all photographs need include a size
reference to help establish that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not always do we have this advantage of
having the ruler, but we could have the
[SPEAKER_00]: need for putting a dollar bill that's six
inches long or something of known size,
[SPEAKER_00]: a pocket knife or just something,
a quarter, a penny, something we know the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of so that it can be determined and
easily measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get a general idea of the
perspective of the size of whatever object
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this is helpful in looking at
our information about photography and how
[SPEAKER_00]: important it is for crime scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
