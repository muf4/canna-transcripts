[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to be looking at
the three primary nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the reason why I have the picture here
is typically these three primary nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: are ones that we're going to be kind of
rescuing the plant with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be feeding the plant and are ones
that if they show a deficiency would be
[SPEAKER_00]: the first we would go through and add or
at least rule out if it's not the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency that we notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one being nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at a fertilizer bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three numbers that are indicated there
are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen is a key component of protein and
chlorophyll, both which are involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: the synthesis and transfer of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps plants with rapid growth of
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives that kind of satisfaction of
adding fertilizer and seeing the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen often comes from fertilizer
applications and can be fixed from the air
[SPEAKER_00]: by legumes and also some soil bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, while it gives that nice rapid
growth of leaves, I caution you because
[SPEAKER_00]: over application can cause plants to have
long internodes, brittle dark green
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, and can be difficult to root when
cuttings are taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here with the giant pumpkin example
what it looks like a plant that is overfed
[SPEAKER_00]: in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get these kind of bloated dark green
leaves, these really long stretch to the
[SPEAKER_00]: stalks here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also get some splitting that can
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these are negative effects of
adding too much nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now phosphorus is an essential part of the
process also for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a critical component of DNA as we see
here in that sugar backbone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It encourages root growth and blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's typically added if you see a bloom
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically it'll have a lot or elevated
levels of phosphorus in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also comes in fertilizer, it's the middle
number, keep in mind, and it's also
[SPEAKER_00]: present in manures.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you over add manures, while they're a
great organic source of nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of times you can over add your
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the match stick here because
there's phosphorus in the area where you
[SPEAKER_00]: strike it against the box of the match or
some sort of rough surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one is potassium as our primary
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absorbed by plants in larger amounts
than other mineral elements except
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen and in some cases calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here being added in very large
bags to be spread on a field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium is supplied by plants,
by soil minerals, organic materials,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's involved with carbohydrate
metabolism, fruit formation, and disease
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you're getting later in the season,
typically potassium demands will increase
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just remind you that potassium is
represented by the letter K, phosphorus by
[SPEAKER_00]: the letter P. Keep those straight and try
not to get those confused because a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: students will mix up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium and phosphorus.
Thank you.
Thank you.
