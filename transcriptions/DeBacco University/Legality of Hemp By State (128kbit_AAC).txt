[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this tobacco university video,
this is going to investigate the legality
[SPEAKER_00]: of hemp by state and try to touch on most
of the states and kind of give you an
[SPEAKER_00]: overview here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, most of the data here is always
probably changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is good for at least a point in
time reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on that note, I make just kind of a
disclaimer note here that this lecture is
[SPEAKER_00]: not meant to serve as legal advisement.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're seeking legal assistance,
please contact your lawyer involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The slideshow is an interpretation as of
that May 7th to November timeframe 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: For complete up-to-date information,
please check with your state authorities
[SPEAKER_00]: as always.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, again, just meant to be a point
in time kind of reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe to get you thinking about,
maybe get you started, but always seek out
[SPEAKER_00]: legal advice for the latest and current
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the importance of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why even go over this in the first place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the 2018 Farm Bill defines hemp as,
in part, acids with delta-9-THC
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of not more than 0.3% on a
dry weight basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, some states have interpreted this
a little differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some states kind of take this statement
literally to mean only the delta-9-THC
[SPEAKER_00]: content in hemp would be used for
determining compliance with the state and
[SPEAKER_00]: federal statutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, other states, for example,
Oregon, interpret the federal statute to
[SPEAKER_00]: mean that because THC-A is an acid
cannabinoid that contains THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: it therefore must be added to the THC
concentration to ensure that their total
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration does not exceed 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also have another video comparing the
total THC versus the delta-9.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's important, again, to
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you're getting these different
interpretations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like we see the images here,
this first one on top, do you see a vase
[SPEAKER_00]: or do you see two faces facing each other
in profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in this image, do you see a duck in
this image or do you see a rabbit in this
[SPEAKER_00]: image?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, states looking at the same 2018
Farm Bill have these different
[SPEAKER_00]: interpretations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's lack of standards across the
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is part of the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not kind of like this nice little
checkerboard or chessboard here where
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is nice and even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some states that use the less than 0.3%
delta-9-THC are listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see quite a few of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: States that define total THC and use
delta-9-THC plus the THC-A are listed
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, organ dimension.
[SPEAKER_00]: States that do not define total THC,
you can see a large number of them listed
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: States where any THC is illegal and
there's a couple listed there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, for more information, there's a
link here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as always in the description,
I have some sources cited there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking just at a couple of the states
here is picking on a couple areas here.
[SPEAKER_00]: States that use the less than 0.3%
delta-9-THC comparison, Montana,
[SPEAKER_00]: Kansas, and Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of give you the definitions
here where Montana is using the test
[SPEAKER_00]: results of mature flowers from mother
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kansas in that industrial hemp means all
parts, varieties of the plant of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis sativa, whether grown or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contained a delta-9-THC concentration
of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight
[SPEAKER_00]: basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Tennessee is looking at THC means
delta-9-THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: States that define total THC and use
delta-9-THC plus THC-A for comparison
[SPEAKER_00]: would be the examples here would be
Arkansas and Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're using these equations that
take into account the delta-9-THC as being
[SPEAKER_00]: THC plus the 0.877 times the THC-A,
which could be theoretically converted to
[SPEAKER_00]: that delta-9-THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others will go as far like Minnesota to
define it's analyzed via high pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid chromatography methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're looking at also defining
potentially what method you're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: what protocols you're using to generate
that THC level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, other videos on this channel to get
into that in a little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: States that do not define the total THC
comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see quite a few listed here,
Ohio, Virginia, and Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan's got a pretty extensive kind of
listing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these are just provided here to
give you that sense of variability from
[SPEAKER_00]: one state to another, not even necessarily
bordering states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is this kind of important?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not to only understand your
potential state laws, but also when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at transporting potential any
product across state lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's best to use the total THC for all
product to ensure that you are not
[SPEAKER_00]: federally charged with possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, if your state does not define
total THC, you should contact them to see
[SPEAKER_00]: how they will be testing or just assume
the total THC, because that will
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretically give you the highest value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is just meant to be at a
point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use this as a reference only.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully this does provide you a
little bit of an idea of some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: variability that does occur from one state
to the next.
