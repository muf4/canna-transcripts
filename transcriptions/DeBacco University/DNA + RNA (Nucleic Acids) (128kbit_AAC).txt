[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at the
macromolecule nucleic acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that this nucleic acid
category is made up of both DNA and also
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see DNA depicted here on the right and
RNA depicted here on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go into a little bit of
detail on how you'll be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: distinguish these two different types of
nucleic acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting off, nucleic acids in general,
the main function is to store genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a blueprint for the building of
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA will be transcribed into RNA,
which is then translated into an amino
[SPEAKER_00]: acid sequence, which will ultimately make
a protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is responsible for transfer of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a blueprint for new cells and a
blueprint for the next generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here two parents passing down an
offspring, and the DNA, or the nucleic
[SPEAKER_00]: acids here, will allow that to be the
blueprint for the next generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see certain traits, certain genes,
being passed on from the parents to the
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, nucleic acids here.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a double helix structure,
and its structure was first proposed in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1953 by Watson and Crick.
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA is a ribonucleic acid, and it's a
single helix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see there's kind of one strand here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, both of these nucleic acids,
their monomers, are what's the building
[SPEAKER_00]: block for these.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's nucleotides.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the building block for nucleic
acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a nice comparison between our RNA
and our DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, RNA is ribonucleic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugar is ribose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see ribose and deoxyribose here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means without oxygen for DNA,
and the sugar ribose here has that
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen-built bond to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bases are A, G, C, and U for RNA,
and A, G, C, and T for DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this letter stand for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's adenine, guanine,
cytosine, and uracil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highlighted that one in blue because
that's unique to RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: For DNA, we still have adenine,
guanine, and cytosine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have thymine, and that's unique to
DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, looking at these two
structures, we see for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA is going to be single-stranded for our
purposes, and DNA is double-stranded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another way we can kind of tell
them apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Key part here is if we look at our monomer
unit, our nucleotides, uracil,
[SPEAKER_00]: that immediately indicates it's RNA,
and we see thymine that immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: indicates it's DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The distribution of these nucleic acids in
eukaryotic cells, well, DNA is found in
[SPEAKER_00]: the nucleus with small amounts in the
mitochondria and also in chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a plant cell, you have DNA in
the nucleus, in the mitochondria,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also in the chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animal cells will have it in nucleus and
in the mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, RNA is actually found
throughout the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's a plant cell or an animal
cell, it's found throughout the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So RNA, single-stranded, basically for our
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some cases where it is
double-stranded, and we should have the
[SPEAKER_00]: big circle with the extra here as we
notice thymine is located.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can clearly indicate that this is
DNA and not RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing the presence here of uracil up in
this corner, we see that that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristic that only RNA has.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned for our purposes, RNA will be
single-stranded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that some viruses are
actually double-stranded, since we're
[SPEAKER_00]: double-stranded RNA, so it does exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just mainly going to look at it as
RNA being single-stranded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commonality between RNA and DNA,
they're both negatively charged,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this process allows gel
electrophoresis to separate DNA segments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do more about this in the
biotechnology lecture series, but what
[SPEAKER_00]: this basically means is if we apply a
charge, we have a positive charge here,
[SPEAKER_00]: because DNA and RNA are both negatively
charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be drawn to the positive charge,
which allows us to separate out fragments
[SPEAKER_00]: of these nucleic acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll understand more in biotechnology why
that's important, but for right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: just realize that they do have a negative
charge because of their backbone,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that allows them to be separated here
through the process of electrophoresis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is involved in a difference in
charge and voltage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
