[SPEAKER_00]: So this Tabaco University video is going
to be looking at the post-mortem changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And due to some of the images used,
viewer discretion is advised proceeding
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the post-mortem interval is looking at
post-mortem changes that refer to changes
[SPEAKER_00]: in the decomposition occurring in the
human body after death.
[SPEAKER_00]: The post-mortem interval, PMI,
is the time it has elapsed since death.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be estimated when it is not known
from such changes using medical or
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Pallor mortis here, what we're
noticing, is a paleness evident in
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals with light to white skin
almost instantly in the 15 to 25 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: after death because of the lack of
capillary circulation throughout the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fairer skinned person is definitely
going to show this visually to a much
[SPEAKER_00]: greater extent in relatively short order,
15 to 20 minutes after death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Algar mortis here, and this is deathy,
and it's referring to the cooling of the
[SPEAKER_00]: body after death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forensic investigators will take the
temperature from the liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very internal organ so it tends
to be very stable in temperature and cool
[SPEAKER_00]: at a very consistent rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body cools at a rate of about 1.4
degrees per hour immediately after death
[SPEAKER_00]: and then slows to 0.7 degrees per hour
after about 12 hours until it reaches the
[SPEAKER_00]: same temperature as the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see the hours after death and
then here we see the core body
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping in mind these are in degrees
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going on to rigor mortis, this is death
stiffness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This occurs because skeletal muscles will
stiffen after death.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lack of oxygen in the cells will
result in calcium buildup in the muscles
[SPEAKER_00]: resulting in the stiffening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rigor mortis becomes apparent in the
eyelids and jaws of the victim and spreads
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the entire body in
approximately 6 to 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before receding again after another 6 to
12 hours so it doesn't last forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dead body that is not stiff has
probably either been dead less than 2
[SPEAKER_00]: hours or more than 48 hours to try to
provide that time of death estimation here
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the presence or absence of rigor
mortis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have liver mortis which is the
discoloration of dependent parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the result of pooling of blood and
tissues after death.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red blood cells break releasing
hemoglobin and turning a purple color.
[SPEAKER_00]: This begins about 20 minutes after death
and reaches a maximum of 6 to 12 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: with the final discoloration being
permanent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between 2 and 8 hours after death the skin
will disappear when the skin is pressed
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again that can help determine
potentially how long someone has died.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also helps us determine the position.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here this person has passed away in
what we call the supine position lying on
[SPEAKER_00]: their back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then with putrification, and this is the
breakdown of proteins and nucleification
[SPEAKER_00]: of most organs, the exact rate of this
process is dependent on many factors to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider especially if they died outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be weather, exposure to either
extreme temperatures or reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures, location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply though consider that warmer
temperatures will equal faster rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take that into consideration when
trying to estimate the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That decomposition time is that process by
which the organic substances are broken
[SPEAKER_00]: down into simpler forms of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this occurs as we've seen many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the apple that fell down,
it's decomposing, breaking down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a recently died snake and the ants
are speeding that process along of the
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposition, going kind of back to the
earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly we have the skeletization process
and this is completed when all soft tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: will have been eliminated leaving only
basically the bones that are left.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here the animal here coming close
to that skeletization process,
[SPEAKER_00]: losing all of the muscle, all of the
organs, all of the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see some hair left.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just kind of getting into a
skeletization would apply getting to just
[SPEAKER_00]: having the skeleton remaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
