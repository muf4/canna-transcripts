[SPEAKER_00]: So in this Tobacco University video,
we're going to explore entry-level ground
[SPEAKER_00]: floor cannabis position.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're interested in kind of just
getting started in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of times you're kind of working at
the ground floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to know more what that might
involve, continue watching this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into entry-level
ground floor cannabis position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting here in the image, we've got some
plants getting hung, ready to go through
[SPEAKER_00]: the drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so the job description is
involving typically that entry-level
[SPEAKER_00]: grower position.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be looking at responsible
that growing, that cultivation of
[SPEAKER_00]: operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to ensure that all plants are
properly maintained and ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to follow current good
manufacturing practices, and you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to report to the manager of the growing
department.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, depending on the size of facility
you're looking at, you could be
[SPEAKER_00]: specializing in just a propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The veg, the flowering, maybe the drying
stage, or if it's a smaller operation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might be going through and responsible
for all portions of the growing cycle of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So important to check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are day-to-day activities just in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always ensure that equipment is working
properly and maintain a safe and clean
[SPEAKER_00]: working environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can conclude cleaning up the plants,
pruning out dead leaves, and removing them
[SPEAKER_00]: from the growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: For harvesting, you could be planting,
transplanting, water and feeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliating, staking, disposal of plant
materials, putting up substrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: all those are involved day-to-day,
depending on what day it is during the
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: For crop inspections, you'll be looking at
pest identification, record-keeping,
[SPEAKER_00]: and track and record data on environmental
factors, temperatures, min-max,
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum temperatures, maximum
temperatures, humidity levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that, and the all-important
documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So qualities that a person must have if
you're thinking about kind of pursuing
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of position, ability to read and
comprehend documents, such as standard
[SPEAKER_00]: operating instructions, properly following
and executing assignments, capable of
[SPEAKER_00]: working well with others, willingness to
learn because hopefully you could progress
[SPEAKER_00]: up the growing facility there over time,
ability to perform math calculations and
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements, important for fertilizers,
ability to focus and pay attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: detail because every grower is going to
have their own suggestions or ways to do
[SPEAKER_00]: things, ability to communicate
effectively, must be reliable and honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part here is showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be there to, again,
take care of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be able to carry and lift 50 pounds,
must be able to spend long hours on their
[SPEAKER_00]: feet to go through in pruning,
removing, harvesting, all that can be very
[SPEAKER_00]: labor-intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, just a general connection here
to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often you work closely with managers as
well as other employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers are the first step in the
manufacturing process, and their attention
[SPEAKER_00]: to detail and quality checks allow for
clean, medical-grade cannabis that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: in the industry today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone can become a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In practice, many companies will hire a
wide variety of employees for the
[SPEAKER_00]: entry-level position.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an easy way to work yourself up and
into the industry there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, don't be afraid if you're taking
that entry-level position.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can learn a lot and get exposed to a
lot and then maybe determine a subset
[SPEAKER_00]: within the cannabis industry that is of
greatest interest to you.
