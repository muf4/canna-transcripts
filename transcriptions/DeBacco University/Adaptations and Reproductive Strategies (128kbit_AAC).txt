[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at
adaptations and reproductive strategies
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, starting with life history of
adaptations in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, life history is the complete life
cycle of an animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at the salmon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life histories are diverse with many
different organisms having different
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptations to their environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chose the salmon here as they choose to
run up to freshwater streams up to where
[SPEAKER_00]: they were born.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that they end up spawning in
extremely shallow water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Considering this is a fish that spends
most of its life out in the open ocean,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't run up to these extremely
shallow, gravelly kind of beds to spawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, an example of a life history
adaptation to get away from some predators
[SPEAKER_00]: here that gives its fry or its small
babies here a chance at survival before
[SPEAKER_00]: entering and spending most of their lives
in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, life history adaptations,
there's two main key ones that we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something called R-selected and
the next one's going to be K-selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's spend a moment here on
R-selected adaptations.
[SPEAKER_00]: These R-selected adaptations are
populations that favor exponential growth
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a very high rate of increase and
they're followed by a rapid rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's kind of like the boom bust model
here of adaptations where they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid rate of increase, they have a rapid
rate of decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: R-selective reproductive strategies are
more opportunistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a short maturation period and
also a short lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example here would be the mosquito.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have many small offspring and usually
one early reproductive cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no parental care and a very high
death rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can see that here with ladybugs,
mosquitoes would be examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the rabbits can multiply at a very
rapid rate and they can have a massive
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease in population sometimes too.
[SPEAKER_00]: More evident here with our mosquitoes and
insects here where they have a very short
[SPEAKER_00]: lifespan, no parental care, and sadly a
very high death rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in contrast to that, these are the
R-selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in contrast to R-selected,
there's something called K-selected
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptations.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are populations that experience
competitive logistic curve of growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: they favor reproduction near the carrying
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's their general adaptations.
[SPEAKER_00]: K-selected individuals have a long
maturation and lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example would be elephants here,
bears, and whales.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have few but large offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually several late reproductive
cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have extensive parental care and as a
result of that, a very low death rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, keep in mind, I'm going to be able to
compare K-selected adaptations to the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in contrast to that, the R-selected ones
and what animals may fall in this and why
[SPEAKER_00]: that's advantageous for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, what animals may fall
in a K-selected and why it's advantageous
[SPEAKER_00]: for those individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking in general here at parental care
strategies, most natural populations
[SPEAKER_00]: exhibit a combination of the RK
adaptations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at two extreme
examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, based on my level, kind of more
R-selected, more K-selected, we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at the kind of the species of
barnacles and oysters, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can produce about 500 million
fertilized eggs per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They invest energy into producing as many
offspring as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a result, they provide no parental
care and as a result have very small
[SPEAKER_00]: portions of that 50 million here actually
survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Species such as gorillas, they only give
birth approximately once every five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they invest a significant amount
of time and energy into ensuring the
[SPEAKER_00]: survival of their offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in this case, the gorillas and
chimpanzees, they choose to have less
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring but put more energy into care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oysters and barnacles put no energy into
care and they just put all their energy
[SPEAKER_00]: into the odds of producing as many
individuals as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here the frog and the rabbits
are kind of more in the middle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chimpanzees and gorillas being one extreme
and oysters and barnacles being the other
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to parental care strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of these are able to succeed in
the global environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that their strategies are very
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
