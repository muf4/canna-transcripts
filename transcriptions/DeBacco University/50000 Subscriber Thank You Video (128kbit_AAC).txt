[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to DeBaco University's 50,000
subscriber thank you video where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating students to grow beyond their
teachers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a special thanks to all 50,000
subscribers to this channel so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what does your subscription mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's been really truly great to see
the worldwide reach of the channel and the
[SPEAKER_00]: main indicator of overall interest is the
number of subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those that have subscribed,
this simple click of the button is very
[SPEAKER_00]: much appreciated as part of this channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of people that value quality
education here provided on DeBaco
[SPEAKER_00]: University is highly encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been great to read all of the
comments to see where you're watching the
[SPEAKER_00]: videos from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, welcome to DeBaco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be your first video intro video
here, but it is an educational based
[SPEAKER_00]: channel and we have the following main
focuses as far as content areas and
[SPEAKER_00]: playlists go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're here because of one of those
playlists, you might want to explore some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the others or maybe you've got
recommended some of those videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of videos here, a lot of
knowledge, a lot of education,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully that you find enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why should you encourage others to
subscribe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, many watch videos to help solve a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are welcome to share the content
and other platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply encourage others to subscribe to
the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way to kind of help spread
the word about the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to continue to this,
again, spread this knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing the number of subscriber count grow
has been encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also quick, easy, and free,
which you really can't say much about
[SPEAKER_00]: other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just included kind of the watch time
for subscribers and just many are not
[SPEAKER_00]: subscribed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully those that are watching some
of these videos can simply just click that
[SPEAKER_00]: button and help that subscriber count
increase even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as a last bit here, thank you to all
the debocuels out there for all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: who have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And will subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
