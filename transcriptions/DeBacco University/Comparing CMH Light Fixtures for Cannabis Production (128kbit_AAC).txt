[SPEAKER_00]: Interested in purchasing a CMH light of
your own?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well stay tuned here in this DeBaco
University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be comparing some of these light
fixtures so you can help make an informed
[SPEAKER_00]: decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at comparison some CMH light
fixtures for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off as a disclaimer I've not
received any financial compensation for
[SPEAKER_00]: writing the following product review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no material connection to the
brands products or services I have
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a standard for comparison all the
lights I'll be showing are 630 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each light will have the good the bad and
recommendations provided for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off the Sun Systems LEC Boss
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great a great compact design can
dim each bulb separately can produce 85%
[SPEAKER_00]: PPF at 20,000 hours 95% reflective
interior.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bad is of course the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recommendations is it does come
recommended can be used in damp locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again does that mean wet and soggy
conditions damp locations it can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the Grower's Choice which has
a range of bulb options as a dimmable
[SPEAKER_00]: ballast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a bulkier reflector and ballast
design so not quite as efficient as some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good entry level CMH grow light if
it's something you are considering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly here this is kind of a quick
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Dimmalux Expert Series 98%
reflective aluminum reflector 7 dim levels
[SPEAKER_00]: streamlined design.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only available in the 240 and 277
volt options and it's great for commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of these if I was to recommend only
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we get to the Dimmalux Expert
Series.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good about this as a 98%
reflective aluminum reflector 7 dim levels
[SPEAKER_00]: and a streamlined design.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is only available though in 240 and 277
volt options.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is great for commercial settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the Gavita Pro 630e SE.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is available with the 930 agro or 942
Phillips lamps which have a very high 1.95
[SPEAKER_00]: PPF per watt per second output which is a
great option to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: However the bad is that they're balanced
but vertically mounted ballast here as we
[SPEAKER_00]: can see in the picture doesn't make it
great for low restrictive ceiling height
[SPEAKER_00]: grow spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also only available in the 208 or
240 volt power options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best suited for commercial growing setup
if this was a light you were looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing that is not ceiling height
limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to the Nanolux Summit Series
module grow light system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ballast can support a variety of light
types so it actually can support HPS,
[SPEAKER_00]: high pressure sodium, MH, metal halide or
CMH bulb options.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also different reflector options
growers can choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bad is kind of the jack of all trades
but really the master of none.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the recommendations would be great if
you want it for multiple uses but for me
[SPEAKER_00]: light should be special so I want a
dedicated light for a dedicated purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I was looking at all these lights if
I was to select one while the decision
[SPEAKER_00]: would be difficult I would select the
Dimmalux Expert Series.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a high quality reflector and a low
profile design.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say in the smaller 315 watt I have
used both the Dimmalux as well as the very
[SPEAKER_00]: first one mentioned the Sun Systems Boss
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're looking here at another one
the Sun Systems LeC Boss light here both
[SPEAKER_00]: very good light lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like the low profile design the
balance design but looking at the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: this one just seems to be a little bit
more refined.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to pay for it but if I was
to select one it'd be the Dimmalux Expert
[SPEAKER_00]: Series for consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
I'll see you in the next one.
