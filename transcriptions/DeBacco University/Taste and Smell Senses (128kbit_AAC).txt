[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at your senses of
taste and smell in a little more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grab the popcorn and enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensing chemicals for taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the taste receptors that you have are
important for sensing chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your taste buds are located in raised
areas called papillae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food chemicals dissolve in saliva and
contact the taste cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dissolving of those chemicals in the
watery secretions of your cells are
[SPEAKER_00]: important to help enhance some of the
taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're really hard to taste something
that's completely dry, this is another
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why your body secretes so much
saliva to help your taste buds work
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different taste buds located in
different regions of your tongue but in
[SPEAKER_00]: general the taste buds are on those raised
portions and they're detecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: sweetness or sourness of particular food
items that you're consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell is also called olfactory receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are cells that are embedded in the
epithelium of the nasal passage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our nasal passage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look in a little more detail we see
these sensors here reaching out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The olfactory bulb is the key part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have our bone area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our basically olfactory receptor
cells here located at number six.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce this intense network.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is causing this nice network of cells
here that are able then to pick up or
[SPEAKER_00]: sense for the sense of smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this smell, this olfactory receptors
are far more sensitive in dogs when
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to our own in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ingredients for the basic chemical
families of explosives such as various
[SPEAKER_00]: powders, chemical dynamite, TNT,
C4 are placed in random containers and
[SPEAKER_00]: dogs are able to learn these types of what
these smell like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they can be used at airports as a way
to detect if something's located in a bag
[SPEAKER_00]: or in a region that it shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_00]: These odors are imprinted on the dog's
brains via consistent repetition and
[SPEAKER_00]: reward.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called Pavlov style of training
the dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Pavlov did was here we see dog sees
food and it salivates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dog hears a bell, just hears a bell,
doesn't recognize anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then what Pavlov did as part of the
experiment was ring a bell and present
[SPEAKER_00]: food causing the dog to salivate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately they trained the dog that when
the bell rang they would automatically
[SPEAKER_00]: increase its salivary secretions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the same thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the dog in training is detected to
find TNT or C4 dynamite it's reloaded with
[SPEAKER_00]: food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore when it's going through in this
case the airport here it knows what it's
[SPEAKER_00]: searching for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does find that it'll be rewarded
with food or a treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why it's put in random
containers is so the dog is not randomly
[SPEAKER_00]: searching and never finds anything it's
getting that continual reinforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a way to kind of show what the
olfactory receptors do look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this intense network.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's that olfactory bulb and this is
kind of what's when we take in air
[SPEAKER_00]: particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This intense network here is sensing our
sense of smell transferring that to the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain allowing us to recognize certain
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this was helpful and adding a
little bit more to your understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: taste and smell senses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
