[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to be covering algae,
and well, it may look nice on kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: waterfront here, growing on the rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a grow space near plants, it may not be
a welcomed guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's found in most areas, though,
that have light exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It itself is not a major concern for
plants, but it can encourage other pests
[SPEAKER_00]: to develop into the sign of poor
cleanliness in growing conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you do see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be encouraged by
over-fertilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here, with the top of the
rockwool here, a very common occurrence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that over-fertilizing in areas that
aren't kept very clean will encourage this
[SPEAKER_00]: formation that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the rockwool cubes in the back
may be kept a little cleaner, maybe newer,
[SPEAKER_00]: not showing or exhibiting the algae that
we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these could be over-fertilized for a
whole host of other reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is evident that something that
were not necessarily the cleanest of
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions were growing these plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The identification, well, it looks like
green slime, and it's a photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: organism, so look in areas that get some
degree of light, even if it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: intentional.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be kind of on the underside of
something, or if there's kind of two
[SPEAKER_00]: things lying on top of one another and
there's a little light getting in,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an idea where algae could be growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see this on the large scale here,
with high and low tide, exposing all areas
[SPEAKER_00]: where algae can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, where to look specifically?
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically found in areas with high
moisture, with light exposure,
[SPEAKER_00]: warm temperatures, and contain some form
of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can grow both biologically active
surfaces as well as inanimate surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because something's plastic or
metal or wood doesn't mean it will not
[SPEAKER_00]: grow there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can easily survive on the exterior
surface of these materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful also to inspect the filters,
as this can reduce system contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will check the lines and
check if they're obvious and see there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no algae, but if their filters contain it,
circulating water can help that algae
[SPEAKER_00]: spread, even though you think you may
clean any area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also be mindful, check those filters,
and make sure they're also algae-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the most effective method for
controlling the plant is to limit the
[SPEAKER_00]: light exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is especially important in hydroponic
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this cave region where there's
light getting in, there's algae,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then where there's no light,
there's basically no algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here deeper in the cave, we see evidence
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by blocking out the light, you can
easily prevent the algae from forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to control it with regular cleanings
is recommended, especially if you see
[SPEAKER_00]: there are no areas where it tends to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful what cleaning products you're
using and make sure they're
[SPEAKER_00]: plant-friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrated, which is 35%-ish hydrogen
peroxide-based products, are often
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended because they have short
residual, meaning they will go through and
[SPEAKER_00]: they will kill the algae, but they won't
last very long, which is good because it
[SPEAKER_00]: will reduce the likelihood of you damaging
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do get this 35% hydrogen peroxide
on you, I will say it will turn your
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember to clean exterior surfaces and
also irrigation lines and water pumps,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also remember, check those filters as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that obvious exterior surfaces,
but also remember the irrigation lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: any water pumps, any filters, all
important for long-term and effective
[SPEAKER_00]: algae control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
