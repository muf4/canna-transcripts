[SPEAKER_00]: Many growers want to know what pesticides
they can use on their plants or how they
[SPEAKER_00]: can utilize them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here at this Tobacco University
video, we're going to take Connecticut,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a good model to use, and look at
some of the guidance that they offer for
[SPEAKER_00]: select pesticide use in regards to hemp
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at some guidance for
select pesticide use in hemp cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, you want to always check
your local regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Department of Energy and Environmental
Protection from Connecticut will be used
[SPEAKER_00]: in this example and only this example.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intention is to offer guidance for
selection of pesticides and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation and production of hemp and
medical marijuana in the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guidance may be updated at any time
or changed, so consider this only as just
[SPEAKER_00]: that, kind of your idea regarding this
particular topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Connecticut, everything must be
registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any pesticide used in the cultivation of
hemp and or medical marijuana crops must
[SPEAKER_00]: first be registered with the Department of
Energy and Environmental Protection,
[SPEAKER_00]: abbreviated DEEP, and may be used in the
state of Connecticut under six outlined
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are those six outlined conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good thing you asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are those six outlined conditions
that we say.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label must allow for the use of
unspecified crops and or plants or other
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this means it is used for unspecified
crops, other crops, flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label must allow for the application
of the pesticide to the intended site,
[SPEAKER_00]: the greenhouse or the field where the
cannabis plants are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The label does not prohibit the use on
crops or plants grown for human
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: All labeled requirements must be followed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Active ingredients on the pesticide label
must be exempt from the requirement of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance for pesticide chemical residues
on or in food per the Code of Federal
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulations 40, Part 180, Subpart D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use of any pesticide must comply with the
requirements of the Connecticut General
[SPEAKER_00]: Statutes, Chapter 441, Pesticide Control
and Regulations, adopted therein,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as all requirements of the Federal
Worker Protection Standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of all the legal mumbo jumbo,
if you will, regarding the conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is, again, looking specifically
at the state of Connecticut as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the current list, caution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So DEP will compile a list of pesticides
that can meet the above criteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: and those are the six standards,
and may be used on sites where hemp or
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana are grown or produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: This list may not be inclusive of all
pesticides that meet the above criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be updated from time to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind it is the grower's
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers, producers of hemp and medical
marijuana crops are responsible to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine which pesticides can be used on
their crops in accordance with the above
[SPEAKER_00]: criteria and assume all risk associated
with their use, including possible crop
[SPEAKER_00]: loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guidance is not an endorsement of any
product and shall not be considered
[SPEAKER_00]: gratuity or efficacy without the risk of
harm to the crop on which it is applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are those kind of items,
are those select pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when it comes to that item list,
see the description in this video for
[SPEAKER_00]: links to these documents here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Provided with the links here so you can
welcome to check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point in time, I download them and
provide them in the links here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, though, that the PDF version
does not contain active ingredient
[SPEAKER_00]: information, and this is only current as
of the publication of this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions concerning this guidance can
be directed by email to deep
[SPEAKER_00]: .pesticideprogram.ct.gov, and keep in mind
that these lists were published or last
[SPEAKER_00]: updated September 18th, 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this can provide you with a good
starting point to see how your local
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations compare.
Thank you.
