[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here we're going to look at some
of the details behind aseptic technique
[SPEAKER_00]: and what this basically is, is keeping
things clean and to the point of being
[SPEAKER_00]: sterile in conditions that require this to
prevent contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aseptic techniques are precautionary
measures taken to prevent contamination of
[SPEAKER_00]: pure cultures and sterile laboratory
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat all organisms as potential
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if that may not be the case,
what does this technique involve?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of this isolation of things
that's occurring, preventing
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination, allowing only the natural
bacteria in that area or that pathogen you
[SPEAKER_00]: might be working with, preventing it from
escaping and limiting cross-transfer of
[SPEAKER_00]: unwanted microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general goal, the proper procedure,
will limit the chance of that
[SPEAKER_00]: cross-contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see kind of here, touching a dirty
surface and going somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the concept is simple, accomplishing
it can be a challenge as all portions of
[SPEAKER_00]: the process must be adhered to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be sterile for a little portion
and then go on and then not be sterile and
[SPEAKER_00]: be sterile again because you'll ruin the
entire protocol there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could also be important, for example,
with food items to prevent contamination
[SPEAKER_00]: when processing food during the cooking
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start sterile, so in the lab
this may involve purchasing previously
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilized products that come in sealed
containers here, might be familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: those at the dentist office, for example,
or you'll have to sterilize what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's techniques, UV light is one
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be sterile fluids that can be
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to start sterile with whatever
tools you're using, whether you purchase
[SPEAKER_00]: them sterile or you sterilize them
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a clean working area, so keeping
the area clean before, during,
[SPEAKER_00]: and after an experiment are key concepts
to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help eliminate the chance for
contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: This goes to equipment that you might be
using for multiple experiments,
[SPEAKER_00]: probes that might be used for different
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure everything starts
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep it as clean during the experiment
and you also clean it afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wash hands and use gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you're using gloves
doesn't mean you don't have to wash your
[SPEAKER_00]: hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hands should be washed before,
then you put the gloves on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember to wash your hands after as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though these ideally will be creating
a barrier between whatever you're working
[SPEAKER_00]: with, it's good practice to wash before,
put the gloves on, work with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then wash after in case anything was
to breach the gloves here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have materials on hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So read over the protocol ahead of time
and be sure all necessary items are in
[SPEAKER_00]: hand or in places that are easy access.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may involve you taking chemicals,
putting them on a tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may keeping things in close quarters
to the equipment you'll be using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read that protocol fully over and then
have everything you need on hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it in close easy access.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will prevent you from having to
travel long distances, which will just
[SPEAKER_00]: help increase the odds of or chance of
contamination occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to work efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the longer it takes you to make
transitions, the greater chance for
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see we're in a sterile hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plates are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the tubes are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a flame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is very close quarters,
easy to find, easy to get to, and through
[SPEAKER_00]: proper lab technique, you should be able
to work through this efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working with petri dishes,
so keep the dishes closed and when you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to access the media, tilt the lid
just enough to gain access.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to say remove the lid and go
through here as this image would show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to just lift it enough just so
you can get in there, transfer what you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to, and then close it back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't lift that lid completely off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it may look like good for this
picture, it's not a true sterile
[SPEAKER_00]: technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're in a hood, this can still
cause a chance for contamination to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to limit that as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see we're working close to a
flame.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just lifting it as much as needed
for the duration that's needed for that
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close it, stack it, and move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all good ways to keep everything
sterile and clean, which is important when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for a high level of detail
in your experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
