[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm gonna go over a brief
overview of xylem and phloem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, these are part of vascular
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Xylem is mainly transporting water and
minerals from the roots to the shoots,
[SPEAKER_00]: so going up the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And phloem, while showing it moving down,
it can move throughout the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be down, that could be up and
to the side because it's transporting
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrates, in this case sucrose,
from source areas of the cell to sink
[SPEAKER_00]: areas where that sugar needs to be stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while there's two kinds of vascular
tissue, we're gonna focus first on xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, phloem being the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And xylem's conducting water and minerals
from the roots to the shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two conducting elements,
the tracheids and the vessel members.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at a microscopic view, this is how
they would look, our phloem and our xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, xylem's transporting that water and
those minerals through these vessel
[SPEAKER_00]: elements and tracheids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these are dead at maturity and
have primary and secondary cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, we are in a plant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pits, in the pits here, the secondary
wall is thin or missing, allowing water to
[SPEAKER_00]: flow laterally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you can see that a little bit
better here where we're getting some
[SPEAKER_00]: lateral movement of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now again, this is still occurring from
the roots all the way up to the shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how it looks at a microscope,
while it may not be stained this same
[SPEAKER_00]: color all the time, the xylem is this
larger region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people consider the xylem to look
like straws.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's maybe a way to help you remember even
though there are these kind of perforated
[SPEAKER_00]: plates that are occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not 100% true to say it is like a
straw, but it does certainly look like
[SPEAKER_00]: them on a microscopic view, in contrast to
the much smaller phloem that is involved
[SPEAKER_00]: with active transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mentioning phloem, let's look at that
in a little more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phloem is nutrient conducting tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in close relation to companion cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two conducting cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's these sieve tubes members and
these sieve cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see an image of that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phloem transport sugars and other items.
[SPEAKER_00]: In angiosperms, which are flowering
plants, the sieve tube elements contain
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar solution, and these sieve tube cells
are surrounded by various supportive
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say close relation to companion
cells, these companion cells can be either
[SPEAKER_00]: adding sugar or carbohydrates to the
phloem or taking it out of the phloem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Translocation in the phloem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phloem is completely composed of cells and
the sieve tube elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phloem sap, as it may be referred to,
travels through perforations called sieve
[SPEAKER_00]: tube plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neighboring companion cells carry out
metabolic functions for the sieve tube
[SPEAKER_00]: elements and provide them with energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: These lateral sieve areas connect the
sieve tube elements to the companion
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does all this kind of summarize
and mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these companion cells are helping
add or take away sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, moving sugars requires energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires active transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these companion cells, in these cases,
are the ones responsible for kind of this
[SPEAKER_00]: loading or unloading of the phloem sap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of this direct comparison for xylem
and phloem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see xylem, all the arrows going from,
in this case, the shoots to, I should say,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the roots all the way up to the
shoots, that one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the roots working its way up through
the plant to the shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now phloem, we see the arrows going up,
arrows going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two-way flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's water and food being exchanged
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's companion cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's food storage cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is moving our carbohydrates,
our sugars, throughout the cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cells here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant can take energy captured
through the process of photosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves and can bring them to storage
organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another good comparison here, our xylem,
again, shoots are up the top here and our
[SPEAKER_00]: roots are down here and that water is
moving from those roots to those shoots,
[SPEAKER_00]: going to the shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phloem can go in both directions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Translocation to the zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: The zinc is the area that's taking on
those sugars, needing those sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sucrose is actually transported from the
source cells and deceived to tube
[SPEAKER_00]: elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: This causes water to enter the phloem from
the xylem, as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resulting positive pressure forces the
sucrose water mixture down towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots, where sucrose is unloaded here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root, an example, would be our zinc
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transpiration causes water to return to
the leaves through these xylem vessels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is this process of transpiration
that I mentioned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's the simple movement of water
through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cohesion theory, the sap accent,
is shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evaporation from the cells in the leaves
produces negative pressure and that
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling force and that gradients causes
water to move upward from the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: through the xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our roots, here's our water
molecules entering the roots here,
[SPEAKER_00]: going up through our trunk of the tree,
and exiting out the stomata, which is in
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves, the top of the plant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, water is coming in here
and leaving out here also, but this kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of shows you the long way that water can
take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our root cells, compared to our
atmosphere, the atmosphere is more
[SPEAKER_00]: negative, indicating water is moving from
the roots, where it's high water potential
[SPEAKER_00]: to this area of low water potential
gradient, and being essentially pulled out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the leaves there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this was helpful in explaining
some of the important functions xylem and
[SPEAKER_00]: phloem perform in vascular plants.
Thank you.
