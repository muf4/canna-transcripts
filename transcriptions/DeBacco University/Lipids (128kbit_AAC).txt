[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at a very short
and brief overview of lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see in the image here,
lipids are a form of basically fats.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how we may associate with this type
of macromolecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the three forms of lipids, fats is one
of them, which brings the focus here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also going to be a video on
phospholipids and steroids if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: check that out on the channel here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking specifically at fats as one of
the forms of lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, typically lipids and fats can
sometimes be considered exchangeable
[SPEAKER_00]: terms, but lipids is the correct broad
macromolecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fats are used for long-term energy
storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually used the term triglycerides,
which as we see here, which means they
[SPEAKER_00]: have three fatty acids with a glycerol
backbone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're composed of these fatty acid
chains and are linked together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are not independent fatty acids,
so it looks like they're kind of separate
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would be linked to this glycerol
backbone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our definition of fats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then being insoluble in water means
that they're hydrophobic in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a very brief overview of
lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, if you're interested in
phospholipids or steroids, there'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: separate videos on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
