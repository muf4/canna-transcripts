[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're choosing to sort your
cannabis buds based on their size and
[SPEAKER_00]: density, this DeBaco University video is
for you because we're going to go into
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the details with this process and
give you some helpful advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into sorting cannabis
buds based on size and density.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, a bud density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bud density is essential because the more
dense, basically the more yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a very dense and flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see one is a lot less density.
[SPEAKER_00]: More density simply means more target
plant material is produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the denser buds has improved
visual appeal, increasing the price
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers are willing to pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if these quote weighed the same,
this would be one that would drive a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher dollar value, which should be the
goal of any grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're maximizing density.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genetics do play a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make a wide selection at the very early
part of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: When growing, keep the environment under
continual control and document the
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to have good records of your
growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Provide the plants, but specifically with
good light intensity and the proper
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing indoors, growing
outdoors, you're limited with the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you're trying to prune them
and make sure you're getting as much light
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure to the bud regions as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This applies in both indoor and outdoor
and you want to have good trimming and
[SPEAKER_00]: pruning style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pruning style, the actual plant trimming
of the actual final bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do not harvest too early, wait until
you get definitely that level of maturity
[SPEAKER_00]: with your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're able to get the maximum
cannabinoids and terpenes and have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: visual end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're starting buds by their size.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be automated, which is advised
for larger scale operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two main commercial options here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both kind of serve the same purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to take a collection of plant
material, collection of plant material,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sort them into different containers or
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one kind of does it with different
hole sizes and kind of move them around
[SPEAKER_00]: and to section them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking, they're all kind of
passed down this area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it gets progressively wider,
the smaller buds will fall through here
[SPEAKER_00]: and be sorted here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the larger buds will make it further
down and be sorted down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this automation is a great way to speed
up this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's the importance of sorting?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do we go through this kind of
process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, bud size can directly correlate to
price.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the extreme case, the popcorn or kind
of the small buds are classified as
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds or kind of B grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: With indoor production, buds will be more
consistent on the plant from the top to
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom, with the top buds still being
the highest concentrations of cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to be very similar to those on the
lower end, but definitely higher with that
[SPEAKER_00]: greater light exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's other studies here on this
channel that will kind of go into some
[SPEAKER_00]: more detail on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For outdoor growing, there tends to be
more variability among buds based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: location on the plant, location within the
field, how it might be shaded,
[SPEAKER_00]: other branches might be blocking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is able to take whether it has
consistent or inconsistent original
[SPEAKER_00]: starting product, maybe it does allow it
to be sorted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a lot of consistency in your
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it leads us to the last point here
would be second cut flower in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: that often these are smaller sized buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if from an indoor grower, the potency
will be very similar to the larger,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically more expensive buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be advantageous for someone who
wants to try a new variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's important to kind of sort that
kind of popcorn to the A grade,
[SPEAKER_00]: simply because it's what a lot of
consumers are looking for, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing dry flower, they want those A
grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second B grades, you can still get some
value in those for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they are sent to make pre-rolls
or extraction in extreme cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you definitely want to select out your
A grade because ideally the A grade
[SPEAKER_00]: quality is going to get you an A grade
price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
