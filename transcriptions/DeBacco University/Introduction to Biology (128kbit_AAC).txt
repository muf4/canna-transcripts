[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to biology with me Mr. Tabaco.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be wondering what you got
yourself into here on day one with the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that I structure my class and just dealing
with the enormity of biology and the wide
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of topics that this one subject
area covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for me in my class I structure it a
little bit differently than you may be
[SPEAKER_00]: used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting off with outside of class the
content is provided in slides that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have access to just like this one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are publicly available and typically
on YouTube and this allows access for a
[SPEAKER_00]: wide variety of locations and also for you
to utilize as a resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents and anyone worldwide can view the
material and comment on it so it is
[SPEAKER_00]: designed to be just more than just for
this class but upon graduating from this
[SPEAKER_00]: class you can use it as a resource to
refer back to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now outside of class rather than take
valuable class time to go over the slides
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be these video lectures
posted for you to view.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be your main homework for
this course which is simply to watch the
[SPEAKER_00]: videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be a little different than
you're used to then kind of just going
[SPEAKER_00]: through and answering a bunch of questions
mainly to watch these videos and to take
[SPEAKER_00]: notes on these videos is your main source
of homework.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you the option to watch them at
any time day or night and review them and
[SPEAKER_00]: pause them and take notes at your own
pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go through them that you can watch
them at speed great if you need to pause
[SPEAKER_00]: them go back go grab a snack all this is
allows you the freedom to view the
[SPEAKER_00]: material at your own pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I will assign certain number of videos
for homework to watch and keep in mind
[SPEAKER_00]: that random video pop quizzes are fair
game at any point for the videos you're
[SPEAKER_00]: expected to have watched up to that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pop quizzes are short and they're
intended to be like an eye test kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: easy and quick you either know it or you
don't know it move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the beginning of class though is your
time to ask specific questions on material
[SPEAKER_00]: if you do have any before we proceed to
the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now during class we're going to build on
the basic information that you gain in the
[SPEAKER_00]: video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We utilize lab activities problem-based
questions so that you're able to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: the material instead of simply memorizing
information which a lot of students I find
[SPEAKER_00]: really want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will likely be times of frustration
you might feel like this at times or like
[SPEAKER_00]: this and this is okay because this is part
of the learning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not meant to be super easy quick just
vocab read memorize know we need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to process the information and I find
for a lot of students that may lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: times of frustration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you just to memorize the
material because the goal is to get away
[SPEAKER_00]: from just that simple regurgitation
memorizing material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be able to understand the
material and also be able to apply the
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: All too often students are great at
memorizing but cannot work with the
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get into this kind of memory
card situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I have the picture of the
squirrel here is you have to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: how to get up the tree climb down the
little string here to get at the bird
[SPEAKER_00]: feeder where the food is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just memorize something you have
to work with and understand and applying
[SPEAKER_00]: the situation he was given.
[SPEAKER_00]: Situation you might be more familiar with
could be a flat tire in a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to go about
understanding them and solving this
[SPEAKER_00]: problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: What tools are you going to grab?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are those tools located?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean to change your study habits so this
course will be an adjustment for many
[SPEAKER_00]: students I find.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pace is very fast and the content is
rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff that we cover here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A single unit can have over a hundred
slides and will only take about five to
[SPEAKER_00]: eight school days to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot cram study the night before.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key is to pace yourself and to do a
little each night so that you're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the material and build upon
that material rather than just try to
[SPEAKER_00]: memorize it all the night before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the positive end at the end of the
year I've gotten some student comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are actual student quotes that I've
received.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the year a lot of students
complain as I'm sure you probably will
[SPEAKER_00]: however looking back some students realize
the bigger picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've said thank you for teaching us to
think on our own or I was able to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the difference between surface
learning and digging deep and probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: situation you're in right now is at the
beginning of the year we were afraid to
[SPEAKER_00]: have you as a teacher because we heard of
how difficult you were but slowly we came
[SPEAKER_00]: to recognize that the reason you pushed us
was for our benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully throughout this course you'll
feel challenged at times but in the end
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll develop a deeper understanding of
biology and improve your study habits
[SPEAKER_00]: overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we'll have a good year together
in biology.
Thank you.
you you you you you
