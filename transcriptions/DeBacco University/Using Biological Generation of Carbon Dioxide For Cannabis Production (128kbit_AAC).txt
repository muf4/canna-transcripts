[SPEAKER_00]: Here on Tobacco University, we're going to
look at biological methods of generation
[SPEAKER_00]: for carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into using biological
generation of carbon dioxide for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can see here, the basic process is
taking glucose, breaking that down,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a sugar monosaccharide,
and breaking it down into what ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be carbon dioxide here that
would be going to be used in many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: food and beverage industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, yeast will generate carbon
dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So simply mixing yeast with a sugar source
will produce carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an easy and low-cost solution that
can likely be made with materials found
[SPEAKER_00]: around many households.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see many different methods of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking a bottle, we're taking a
tube, having that carbon dioxide being
[SPEAKER_00]: siphoned out and put directly into the
grow space with really relatively simple,
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are commercial sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are these commercial sources of
biological generation of carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: that offer extended production.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use some special mycelium-based
strains to allow for efficient production
[SPEAKER_00]: of carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the process is very easy to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Companies claim a six-month life to their
products, and we see just a couple shown
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just keep in mind, because it is a
biological system, there will be certain
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of degree of optimum as far as
temperature goes and humidity and food
[SPEAKER_00]: sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep in mind, it will produce
carbon dioxide, but biological systems do
[SPEAKER_00]: have their limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the downfall of using these biological
systems, no matter what name brand or
[SPEAKER_00]: source you're looking at, biological
generation is inherently variable,
[SPEAKER_00]: so your plants will not receive a
consistent dose of carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there is no monitoring system to
regulate the carbon dioxide levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning some points they could be very
high levels, others could be very low
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: These systems also work day and night,
and carbon dioxide is only usable by the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants during the daylight hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have times of production of carbon
dioxide that it can't really be utilized
[SPEAKER_00]: by the plants you're trying to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that reduces the inefficiency of the
overall system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's also, with anything,
you should be doing a cost-benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while adding any carbon dioxide above
ambient, around 400 parts per million,
[SPEAKER_00]: can be beneficial to the plants with
biological-based products the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: addition cannot be measured, controlled,
or repeated.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are different things to keep in
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it may help you grow one cycle,
it's going to be difficult to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat those exact conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while these systems can offer some
benefits, the consistency of a dedicated
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide enrichment system will
provide long-term increase in yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: assuming all other factors are not
limiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, using a true compressed bottle
system or a liquid system can also allow
[SPEAKER_00]: for very consistent results, as well as
monitoring of your environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, all which play into maximizing
plant production.
