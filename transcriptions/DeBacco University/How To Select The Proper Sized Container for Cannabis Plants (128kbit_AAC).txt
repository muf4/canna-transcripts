[SPEAKER_00]: Ever wonder how to select the proper size
container for your cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this Tobacco University is going to
help you with that very topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the video so you
can select the right container size for
[SPEAKER_00]: your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, there are factors that can
depend on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not one quick, really easy answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I'll kind of go through and just
give you some of the basic rundowns here
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can make an educated decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, you want to consider what
strain you're going to grow in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: that how big did you plan on that plant
getting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the substrate you select.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the water holding capacity of that
substrate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pruning method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the plants small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you letting them grow quite large?
[SPEAKER_00]: That can affect the size of the container
that's going to be a best fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, your growing environment,
meaning how large of an area do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow in?
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be both in square footage,
but also want to be thinking about height
[SPEAKER_00]: as well and how that impacts the
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see here a bunch of plants
growing together, very variable sizes of
[SPEAKER_00]: containers, probably not maximizing the
production here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want to consider factors such as
the cost, the container, and or the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of substrate you might be using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smaller containers can save costs,
but will increase plant stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Duration of the growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: How old will your plants be at harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking for a quick turnaround
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be something that's going to
be a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a grower preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply what do you like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of size do you prefer?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of substrate are you buying?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is this all going to factor into
things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Providing some general suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I underlined the word here,
general, because it is just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to provide just some example
here, some suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant size and suggested container size.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use this as just a general guide or
at least a starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: For your 12 inches, you're looking at
about that two to three gallon container.
[SPEAKER_00]: For 24 inches, you can up to a three to
five gallon container.
[SPEAKER_00]: For 36 inches or three foot tall,
you're looking at six to eight gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four feet tall, eight to 10 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 60 inches or above a 12 gallon
container would be recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this could depend on your pruning
style, substrate, growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least if you are looking for an
area to start, this is where I would
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest you at least start to see how well
this may work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have things provided here in the
metric system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get, again, another idea of
height in centimeters compared to the size
[SPEAKER_00]: of the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: The container expressed in liters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a natural progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at the larger plants
typically being grown in larger
[SPEAKER_00]: containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it does not mean that as a plant goes
from 12 inches to 24 to 36 to 48 to 60,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're constantly changing the containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to skip one, start with a
little bit larger size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not let the plants get quite as big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this does not mean you're going
to be transplanting this plant from maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: the propagation to a 12, when it's 12 inch
and every foot increment from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for commercial production setups,
as we see here, typically these will use
[SPEAKER_00]: about a five to seven gallon max size
container for their plants and will
[SPEAKER_00]: reserve larger sizes only for mother or
stock plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to kind of the comparison for
production, typically five to seven
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons sizes is kind of the max that
they're using for their production plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, use that as just a general guide
and hopefully this provides you with a
[SPEAKER_00]: good starting point to help maximize your
production by selecting the right
[SPEAKER_00]: container to grow your cannabis plants in.
