[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to answer the question of
why allele frequencies change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why in this case, if we have one red
individual that then goes to four,
[SPEAKER_00]: then shifts basically the whole population
to the red individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do the allele frequencies change over
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go through a couple reasons why this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the Hardy-Weinberg equation is true
only if the following five assumptions are
[SPEAKER_00]: met.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, large population size, random
mating, no mutations, no migration,
[SPEAKER_00]: and no natural selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about in those videos,
because this rarely occurs in a normal
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's five evolutionary forces that
can significantly alter the allele
[SPEAKER_00]: frequency in a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic drift, non-random mating,
mutation, migration, and selection are all
[SPEAKER_00]: things that can cause this shift to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, these are assumed in the
Hardy-Weinberg equation, but this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more accurate that we might see
in a given population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see here, 50% of individuals
targeted by predators here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brown ones have good camouflage,
the black ones have poor camouflage,
[SPEAKER_00]: and over certain generations we see a
selection for the brown phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So five agents for evolutionary change.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mutations occur, again, just normally with
DNA polymerase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be influenced by the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene flow, the movement of genes from one
population to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-random mating, where in this case we
see a female choosing this male over this
[SPEAKER_00]: male with showier feathers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resulting in a population that has shifted
to showier feathers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic drift, where we're drifting
towards a certain phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course selection, for in this case
it could be one color that camouflages
[SPEAKER_00]: better compared to another color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genetic drift, let's explain this just
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic drift in a population can lead to
the elimination of allele from a
[SPEAKER_00]: population by chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: In each generation a random set of
individuals reproduces to produce the next
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The frequency of alleles in the next
generation is equal to the frequency of
[SPEAKER_00]: alleles among the individuals we produce
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see here, here's our population,
very similar to the first one that we
[SPEAKER_00]: said.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetic drift here, the brown ones,
producing it with some heterozygotes and
[SPEAKER_00]: some homozygotes dominants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see this population breeding here,
and we notice that now we have all
[SPEAKER_00]: homozygous dominants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is just a genetic drift
drifting towards a certain genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Random sampling in genetic drift,
so we're gonna watch a little animation
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It occurs over five generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a simulation of common example used
to describe the effect of random sampling
[SPEAKER_00]: as genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this population of 20, there's a shift
from an allele frequency of 50% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: blue allele to 100% for the blue allele in
just five generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here there's a nice 50-50 in the
original population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our second generation goes through this
sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see there's been a increase in the
number of the blue alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, again, random sampling here
once they get to choose to pass on their
[SPEAKER_00]: genes to the following generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: After three generations, we see there's
even a greater reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now because this is random sampling,
this doesn't mean that it's always gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: occur in the same proportion.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we'll see in this animation,
if we're able to count the red alleles,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say there's actually one more in
this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But getting to the fifth generation,
only the blue ones are selected,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what carries on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this genetic drift, it's a random loss
of alleles, more likely to occur in a
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller population.
[SPEAKER_00]: The founder effect is a small group of
individuals establishes a population in a
[SPEAKER_00]: new location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often this can result in what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our parent population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a migrating population,
which is a very small portion of this
[SPEAKER_00]: total individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They form here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice that the purple ones initially
are a very small percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for whatever reason, those are
selected for, and we see now a greater
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of them, ultimately getting to
the loss of the red allele to only the
[SPEAKER_00]: purple alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This occurs typically more common in
smaller populations when a group may leave
[SPEAKER_00]: one area or one island and go to another
island.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get that isolated population,
and we get that separation there occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The random loss of alleles more likely
occur in that smaller population,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's also true for what is termed the
bottleneck effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, under genetic drift,
we have the founder effect, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: small group of individuals establishing in
a new location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the bottleneck effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sudden decrease in population size
due to natural forces, kind of that
[SPEAKER_00]: necking down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parent population, see the genetic
variation, a bottleneck event occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be disease, could be famine,
could be a whole host of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a bottleneck because it kind
of goes through a small opening,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have a surviving population here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green and the yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing here, high initial population,
bottleneck effect, reducing the
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's looking for these
particular individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a term bottleneck because that's
what's referring to the neck of a bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: where it thins down a large population
being forced to a small area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-random mating.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is mating that occurs more or less
frequently than expected by chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inbreeding mating with relatives increases
the homozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outbreeding with mating with non-relatives
increases heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So non-random mating means that the
individuals are being selected for some
[SPEAKER_00]: reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just random.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be, in this case, the brown
colors deemed favorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mutations, another reason why allele
frequencies change.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is indeed a replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ultimate source of new
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mutation rates are too low to
significantly alter genetic frequencies on
[SPEAKER_00]: their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: There also needs to be kind of selection
forces against there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we say mutation, this takes us back
to some previous lectures, myself over
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to have some silent mutations,
some nonsense and missense mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be some more drastic ones,
such as duplication, inversion,
[SPEAKER_00]: insertion, translocation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these are different types of
mutations that could occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: All errors in DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Migration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Movement of individuals from one
population to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very potent agent for change.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's immigration, movement into a
population, and emigration, movement out
[SPEAKER_00]: or exiting a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see on this side, we see the
emigrating population.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're exiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on this side, we see the
emigrating population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that this homozygous recessive
bird has emigrated and emigrated into this
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all homozygous dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with this individual here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming it survives and reproduces,
we'll now increase the allele frequencies
[SPEAKER_00]: of the recessive allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last portion of selection here is the
selection process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some individuals leave behind more
offspring than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for that overlap there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Artificial selection is when breeders
select desired characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And natural selection is the environment
selecting for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selection is a stats concept here in math.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you have your sample and you
have a sample within a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're selecting for that one,
in this case, particular individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannot predict the fate of any single
individual, but it's possible to predict
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of individual will tend to
become more common in a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can't be for very specific reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exact individual, as we kind of
indicate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the individual, we can probably
determine what traits this individual
[SPEAKER_00]: might have.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to have a subset of a larger
population that is representative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulling from each of the groups here to
get our sample.
