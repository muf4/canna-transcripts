[SPEAKER_00]: Growers often wonder how plant hormones
can affect cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well here we're going to look at a
scientific study that's the impact of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth regular NAA on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right let's get into the study here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off the two hormones NAA and BAP
are the ones that were studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nase is synthetic meaning it does not
occur naturally plant hormone in the auxin
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to see kind of how auxins
impact cannabis plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This auxin family can also be toxic at
high concentrations to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentration in dose is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The common ingredient with many plant
rooting natural horticultural products
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of them say naturally occurring
you know auxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well this one is a synthetically produced
but it is in the auxin family which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally occurring plant hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now BAP is the first generation synthetic
cytokinin another plant hormone that
[SPEAKER_00]: causes plant growth and development
responses such as setting blossoms and
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulating cell division.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an inhibitory of respiratory kinase
in plants and increases post-harvest life
[SPEAKER_00]: in green vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the examples of those hormones
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these were done in an exact study
on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're wondering what that study was
and some of them may be more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: specifics here's the proper citation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's kind of that first page there for
you're welcome to go research it take a
[SPEAKER_00]: look at it and look at it in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: However what they basically found when
provide kind of that general summary here
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at mean plant height.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at our two graphs here
the control is the solid line in both and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the lighter or dashed line is the
different hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you mind NA is the auxin family BAP is
in the cytokinin family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these graphs we're looking at the
mean plant height over all three tested
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The NA is in graph A up here and BAP is in
the graph B.
[SPEAKER_00]: The means covered with at least one
identical lowercase letter did not have a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant difference at a p-value of
0.05.
[SPEAKER_00]: The arrows show the period 60 to 90 days
during which applications took place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see the application made here
around day six and then another
[SPEAKER_00]: application made here around day 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing the changes that occur over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall a days after planting the plant
height is going to be taller in the
[SPEAKER_00]: control which is basically the non-treated
plant compared to the one that had the
[SPEAKER_00]: auxin family hormone applied and here the
control also ended up mean plant height
[SPEAKER_00]: was taller compared to the one with had
the cytokinins applied to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again these are all significantly
different and we can see that throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the growth cycle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the number of internodes so as we're
looking at kind of counting the internodes
[SPEAKER_00]: the mean number of internodes per axillary
branch over two tested genotypes and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can look at the study for more information
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Means covered with at least one identical
lowercase letter did not offer
[SPEAKER_00]: significance again that p-value of 0.05.
[SPEAKER_00]: The arrows show the time at point six days
after planting of the first application
[SPEAKER_00]: and treated with the auxin and the
cytokinin respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at the number of
internodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see a similar pattern to
control having more internodes than the
[SPEAKER_00]: auxin family hormone or the cytokinin
family hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically true shortly after
application they were both applied and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we see that separation after that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the mean number of axillary branches
we're looking at the branching point now
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis in centimeters over the three
tested genotypes with our same two
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones being studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again same statistics applied p greater
than 0.05 is different letters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The arrows show the same point six days
after planting for the first application
[SPEAKER_00]: and again here we see a large difference
of the control compared to the auxin
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Length of axillary branches much longer in
the control compared to those with that
[SPEAKER_00]: were applied with the auxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a similar difference in most cases
with the cytokinin applied but a generally
[SPEAKER_00]: a similar trend even though it is reduced
in length of axillary branches with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytokinin applied one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now PGRs are important for cannabis sativa
so the results of this study showed that
[SPEAKER_00]: this extra these exteriorly applied plant
growth regulators abbreviated PGRs mainly
[SPEAKER_00]: NA and BAP had significant impacts on the
plant architecture of this cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these PGRs led to more compact
compact plant morphology so that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous because the plants didn't
grow more doesn't mean that's necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: what growers are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The use of NA led to more compact plant
architecture with a consistently high
[SPEAKER_00]: inflorescence yield for that for the
particular genotype that they studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD or cannabidiol content was not
affected in these so again good to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what was affected morphologically but not
affected on the cannabinoid produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind a word of caution here
that there's no approved PGRs so in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation of medicinal grade cannabis
production there are currently no approved
[SPEAKER_00]: PGRs to modify plant architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This study was really just showing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are PGRs in production under good
manufacturing practice typically
[SPEAKER_00]: abbreviated GMP or good agriculture and
collection practice GACP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guidelines are not clearly defined so any
products applied to the plants should be
[SPEAKER_00]: documented for sure there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again there's different rules always laws
and changing but definitely documented as
[SPEAKER_00]: of right now there's no approved PGRs for
cannabis applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're looking at kind of our kind of
important for that plant morphology it is
[SPEAKER_00]: important to note that the use of PGRs did
not reduce the biomass yield in the
[SPEAKER_00]: content of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goals were to small compact plants
intended for indoor growing environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The example here I have potentially for
like a grow tent or something might be
[SPEAKER_00]: sealing and generally size limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: The NAA produced a short habit plant
reduced number of internodes in sitting in
[SPEAKER_00]: the shortest axillary side branches so
that's the effects of applying that oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: family hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cytokine based family of hormones BAP
created that short shorter habit reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: number of internodes and shorter axillary
side branches so just important to note
[SPEAKER_00]: that both of these created that more
compact plant which might be advantageous
[SPEAKER_00]: for some growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the degradation so synthetic IAAs
which are indole acetic acid are more
[SPEAKER_00]: stable than the ones applied endogenously
which are the ones produced in the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and are degraded at a slower rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking or considering plant
hormones we want to consider the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: they are going to be broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is it going to be a really rapid kind
of quick exponential decay here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be a slower more linear
form that could be dependent on the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone, dependent on the condition,
depending on a lot of environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: factors as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again important to take into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know the application and the
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with all hormones when using synthetic
PGRs it's very important to know the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the appropriate application method
and also the concentrations to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: potential negative impact on the final
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned one of these was an oxygen
family hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well certain oxygen family hormones
applied at the right levels high levels
[SPEAKER_00]: can actually be herbicides or basically
kill plants like 2,4-D falls into that
[SPEAKER_00]: category.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to know with IAAs it's a
high concentration are toxic and utilized
[SPEAKER_00]: as an herbicide and that would be that
2,4-D.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again a little can be good but a lot
can potentially kill the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just good practices for growers to know
the application, know the right
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration, look at scientific studies
like the one presented here in detail to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you're getting all those correct
so you're getting the potential benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're seeking without any of the
potential negative side effects.
