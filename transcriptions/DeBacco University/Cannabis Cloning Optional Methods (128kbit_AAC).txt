[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video
where I'll be covering cannabis cloning
[SPEAKER_00]: options and particularly the advantages
and disadvantages of two main options.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, the cut and stick method into the
aeroponic cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come join me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the advantages
and disadvantages of some cloning options
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, there are two main methods
being the cut and stick method and then
[SPEAKER_00]: aeroponic cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now both can get you to the same end
result, but both have their own advantages
[SPEAKER_00]: and disadvantages that I'm going to cover
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the cut and stick method
when we're talking about cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why growers typically choose
this method is it's very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also requires a minimal amount of
materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we can see here, we have some oasis
blocks, some perlite, maybe a little
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity dome, some lighting, nothing too
out of the ordinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ordinary great advantage of this cut
and stick method, we're simply cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: those vegetative propagation clones and
sticking them into the various substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are some disadvantages with
this method as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, you really cannot see the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a grower, you're kind of guessing,
and this can be a slower method of
[SPEAKER_00]: rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at where you need to really
be under the gun to go through and turn
[SPEAKER_00]: one over with the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be a little bit slower of a
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now compared to aeroponic cloner,
a great advantage of the aeroponic cloner
[SPEAKER_00]: is it allows the growers to physically and
actually visually see the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very efficient method of production
and it can allow for individual clones to
[SPEAKER_00]: be transferred at the ideal time,
simply because the grower can actually see
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can allow individuals to be
transferred over to the next step at the
[SPEAKER_00]: right or optimum time.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are disadvantages with the
aeroponic cloning method and this does
[SPEAKER_00]: require special equipment and electrical
power source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, growers can lose the entire batch of
clones that they may have going if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reason why this is, is they're a minimal
buffering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pH is really important to dial in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, can potentially turn clones out a
little bit faster, allow growers to see
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, requires some special equipment
and does have a tendency for the growers
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a little bit more attention to
detail with the aeroponic cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gave you good pros and cons of
each.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's one you want to learn more
about, check out Tobacco University for
[SPEAKER_00]: more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
