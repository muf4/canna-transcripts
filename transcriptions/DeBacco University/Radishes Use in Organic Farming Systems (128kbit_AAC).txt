[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to be going over radish use in
[SPEAKER_00]: organic farming systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, if you're wondering how you might
want to incorporate radish in organic
[SPEAKER_00]: farming systems, this is a little research
article that I'm going to provide a great
[SPEAKER_00]: summary of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, that article, this is that
if you want to look at it in more detail,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for the citation right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to look at some more of the
specifics, here is your research article.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at two, I'm going to provide a
summary here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the radish seed stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we're looking at our radishes,
there are currently two radish varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: that are marketed for cover cropping with
certified genetics, Graza, Raza,
[SPEAKER_00]: and tillage radish.
[SPEAKER_00]: All radishes are insect pollinated and
cross-pollinate easily, increasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: likelihood of genetic variability,
if not grown in strict isolation of one
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the effects on soil structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we're looking at under
favorable conditions, radish roots can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually extend three feet deep in only 60
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root commonly referred to as a tuber,
even though it's not botanically correct,
[SPEAKER_00]: can extend more than 12 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: After radishes winter kill, their large
fleshy roots desiccate, and the channels
[SPEAKER_00]: created by those roots tend to remain open
at the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: This opening that we can see located right
over here, created by those roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to allow for improving of
infiltration, surface drainage,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also aid in soil warming, all great
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, radishes can also have an effect
on weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good stand of radishes can eliminate
nearly all weed growth both during and for
[SPEAKER_00]: some time after active radish growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: To obtain near complete weed suppression,
radishes should be planted early,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically six or more weeks before frost,
at relatively high population,
[SPEAKER_00]: densities, which is considered to be more
than five plants per square foot into a
[SPEAKER_00]: clean seed bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't really compete well
initially, but in that clean seed bed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can have some of those kind of
suppression, weed suppression,
[SPEAKER_00]: allopathic effects, even post-radish
removal or death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the effects on seed bed preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, after winter kill or other causes of
mortality, radish residues deteriorate
[SPEAKER_00]: rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, fall biomass production is
unlikely to interfere with spring field
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a great thing, unlike some other
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking here at the dates,
this is basically the month of April,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're looking at volumetric soil
concentration, and then we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: daily range of soil temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing rye compared to a radish
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the rye tends to have colder soil
temps than the radish overall,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that can be important for spring
planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to get that soil warmed up
quicker to get germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at no cover crop forage
radish and rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rye being a pure, and then down here being
the forage radish, that volumetric soil
[SPEAKER_00]: water concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're reducing the amount of water in
that soil, allowing it to infiltrate more.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the early spring, that is what can help
allow our soils to warm up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're removing some of that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we see here at the end, must've been
some rain events that occurred,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for the most part, reducing that
moisture can allow that ability for
[SPEAKER_00]: growers to go into a field earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now effects on soil erosion and runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So radishes grow rapidly when planted in
late summer or early fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 10 pounds an acre drilled on a 7.5
inch rows can provide full canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: enclosure in about three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This canopy interrupts raindrops,
minimizing surface impaction and
[SPEAKER_00]: detachment of soil particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decomposing residue due to winter kill can
still provide early spring erosion
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: All great things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at it kind of here in soil loss in
pounds per acre at farm A and farm B.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see no cover crop versus cover crop
being a radish.
[SPEAKER_00]: The erosion from the three February to
March storms was negligible for forage
[SPEAKER_00]: radish, despite rapidly decomposition of
soil surface residues here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see just clearly here,
two different farms, the massive
[SPEAKER_00]: difference that the incorporation of
radish as a cover crop can impact on the
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in soil loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we all know, soil is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, we can reduce erosion and
runoff are good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, there are some potential problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not everything is 100% perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because radishes have little taunts for
wet soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So radishes are very responsive to
nitrogen and nitrogen deficiency limits
[SPEAKER_00]: their ability to compete with weeds and
grow through compacted soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not great to put into a really severely
nitrogen deficient field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radishes are only moderately cold hardy
and need about six weeks of favorable
[SPEAKER_00]: growing conditions to produce sufficient
biomass to achieve most of the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep that in mind as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a warning, rotting radish residues can
produce a powerful rotten egg like kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfur like odor, particularly during
winter thaws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have neighbors close by and are
planting in high densities, that could
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially cause you some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be aware of that with everything
there is a benefit and there can also be
[SPEAKER_00]: some drawbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want you to be fully aware
before you commit to this entirely,
[SPEAKER_00]: but definitely worth some consideration
for some of the benefits, but also keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind some of those drawbacks.
