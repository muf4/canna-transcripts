[SPEAKER_00]: Now while a firearm at a crime scene is a
valuable piece of information,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is evidence that goes beyond the
firearm that investigators need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: mindful of.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times this gets a lot of
attention, but let's look at some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence you can get even beyond just a
firearm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, looking at the firearm,
yes there's makers models, but if we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to handle that very carefully,
because fingerprints may also be found on
[SPEAKER_00]: the gun itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could also be found on the casings,
but usable prints are rarely found on the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual firearm, and also because you may
have a lot of heat developed that could
[SPEAKER_00]: ruin some of those oils that are
deposited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obliterated or altered firearm sealer
numbers can sometimes be restored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something else that kind of
identifies the gun as being unique,
[SPEAKER_00]: that serial number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Firearms can be test fired to obtain known
specimens for comparison to evidence,
[SPEAKER_00]: ammunition components such as bullets,
cartridge cases, and also shot shell
[SPEAKER_00]: casings as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you have a lot of things to gain
more than just the physical firearm
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you also have a trigger pull
examination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that refer to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well regards to the gun, there'll be a
certain amount of pressure need to apply
[SPEAKER_00]: for that trigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So firearms examinators can determine the
general conditions of the firearm and
[SPEAKER_00]: whether the firearm is mechanically
functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trigger pull examination can determine
the amount of pressure necessary to
[SPEAKER_00]: release the hammer and firing pin of the
firearm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll measure how much, how many pounds
it takes to pull the trigger to allow the
[SPEAKER_00]: firing pin to go through and to send the
bullet down the barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examinators can determine whether the
firearm was altered to fire the full
[SPEAKER_00]: automatic mode as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only may some people choose to
modify the actual trigger pull,
[SPEAKER_00]: they could also modify it so that one pull
of the trigger will fire multiple rounds
[SPEAKER_00]: as in like a full automatic weapon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the gauge and also manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the shot pellets, the buckshot or
slugs, examinators of shot pellets,
[SPEAKER_00]: buckshot and slugs can determine the size
of the shot, the gauge of the slug and the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer by simply finding that also
at the crime scene through the
[SPEAKER_00]: investigative process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wadding may also be found and
examinators of wadding components can
[SPEAKER_00]: determine the gauge in manufacture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that wadding is just simply that
kind of plastic components that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: holding kind of a bunch of small BBs or
pellets together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though it may just be a small
little plastic piece, when you find that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be used to kind of go back and
try to determine the potential gauge in
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacture that was used as far as
propellant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last we have firearm accessories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's different ways to modify
certain firearms or people may choose to
[SPEAKER_00]: modify certain firearms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shot pattern examinators can determine
the approximate distance at which a
[SPEAKER_00]: shotgun was fired by testing specific
firearm ammunition combinations at known
[SPEAKER_00]: points, between two points.
[SPEAKER_00]: How far was that shooter away?
[SPEAKER_00]: How close were they?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the distance?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was kind of, what were they using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can be very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silencers, as we see here attached to
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's not just your,
can be used to handguns and not just your
[SPEAKER_00]: large or long rifles here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cutaway of what a silencer may
look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are attachments that can be reduced
the noise of the firearm by suppressing
[SPEAKER_00]: the sound during firing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tests can be determined whether a muzzle
attachment can be classified as a silencer
[SPEAKER_00]: upon measuring the sound reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also other gun parts that can be
examined to determine the caliber or model
[SPEAKER_00]: of the gun and what parts were originated,
what modifications were made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, all these little factors come into
play.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go just beyond the standard shotgun
manufacturer or handgun manufacturer,
[SPEAKER_00]: rifle manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of other things to take in
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while finding the firearm is great,
a good investigator will be able to take
[SPEAKER_00]: these other factors into consideration to
try to pinpoint and make matches as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: what may have actually occurred during the
crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
