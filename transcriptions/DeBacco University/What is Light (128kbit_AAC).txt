[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're looking at the simple
question, what is light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, when we're relating it to
plants, we want to keep in mind whether
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about an actual sunlight,
or if we're looking at artificial light
[SPEAKER_00]: and how that may differ between the two,
what spectrums they may give.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we're looking at the
electromagnetic spectrum, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: range of all types of electromagnetic
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The radiation is energy that travels and
spreads out as it travels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examples of those are radio waves,
visible light, which is only a small
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of the full electromagnetic
spectrum, UV light, and X-rays and gamma
[SPEAKER_00]: rays also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep in mind, of this entire
range, only a very small portion of that
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually visible light.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the light spectrum, it's many different
wavelengths of energy produced by a light
[SPEAKER_00]: source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now light is measured in what's called
nanometers, and you can think of that as
[SPEAKER_00]: really small meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each nanometer represents a wavelength of
light or band of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this image, or prism, tries to show
here, we have white light coming in,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have the different colors being
separated out.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if we look closely, and also we
see that here, there's different
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see the red is a much longer
wavelength than, say, the indigo or the
[SPEAKER_00]: violet down here, a much shorter
wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that also down over here also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, this light spectrum,
this visible light, is only a very small
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of the entire electromagnetic
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it brings the question of, well,
what's sunlight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunlight, sun gives off infrared,
visible, and ultraviolet light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunlight is filtered through the Earth's
atmosphere and is a combination of that
[SPEAKER_00]: ultraviolet, or UV light, visible light,
and also infrared radiation, which we
[SPEAKER_00]: interpret as heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sunlight is a wide variety of things,
more than just what we visibly can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's that visible light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that visible spectrum is the portion
of the electromagnetic spectrum that's
[SPEAKER_00]: visible to the human eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: The typical human eye will respond to
wavelengths from 380 to 700 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a very small range of the entire
electromagnetic spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I do want to point out,
as we saw in the previous images,
[SPEAKER_00]: radio waves are still the long waves,
but in this case, they're on the
[SPEAKER_00]: right-hand side.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some of the other images, they're on
the left-hand side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep in mind, you have to be
looking at the units when you see any sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of spectrum or chart here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red is kind of that larger wavelength,
and those violets and blues are those
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter wavelengths that will always
remain a constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, it doesn't mean they're
always going to be on the left or the
[SPEAKER_00]: right side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, color temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is measured in degrees Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more for us humans than the plants
we're trying to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of emphasis is put on the Kelvin
temperature chart when looking at interior
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting for lighting up a particular
room, because our eyes have a harder time
[SPEAKER_00]: distinguishing changes at the ends of the
blue and red colors of the visible light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our eyes are actually most sensitive to
green, or 555 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're at the highest perceived
brightness.
[SPEAKER_00]: These other warm whites, neutrals,
or daylights, again, apply more to
[SPEAKER_00]: interior design than it does plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though some grow lights will quote
the color temperature, it's of little
[SPEAKER_00]: importance to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
