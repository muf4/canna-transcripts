[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to provide a brief
overview of what's called cation exchange
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity, or CEC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to get into too much in the
exact of the details of the chemistry or
[SPEAKER_00]: the interaction here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to have a basic understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something very commonly provided
on soil tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers tend to have questions
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, cation exchange capacity, or as I
said, is abbreviated CEC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the measure of the soil's ability
to hold positively charged ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are important because we see the
positively charged ions mentioned here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These CEC influences the soil's ability to
hold onto essential nutrients and provide
[SPEAKER_00]: a buffer against soil acidification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we see that the soil particle here has
that typical permanent negative charge,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's going to attract or hold these
positive ions, which tend to have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the nutrients that the plants need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first off, that cation that I had
mentioned, well, that's an atom with a
[SPEAKER_00]: positive charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that it's less lost in
electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we go back to hydrogen atom here,
one proton, one electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protons have a positive charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electrons have a negative charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if it's a cation, that means it's lost
an electron in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it loses an electron, becomes
oxidized, or this becomes now a positive
[SPEAKER_00]: ion, which would be properly termed
cation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, an atom with a
negative charge is an anion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here we're gaining another electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electrons have a negative charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being reduced, and we have the
hydrogen anion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, anion negatively charged, cation
positively charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since this is cation exchange capacity,
it's ability for soils to exchange
[SPEAKER_00]: positive ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those base cations, as we've
mentioned, are important nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as calcium, magnesium, sodium,
and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all involved in those cations
that are interacting with the roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: the negatively charged soil particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: What influences CEC?
[SPEAKER_00]: The soils with higher clay fraction tend
to have higher CEC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic matter also has high CEC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you're looking at just increasing
CEC, well, if you're adding organic matter
[SPEAKER_00]: and clay materials, well, that's just
naturally going to increase that CEC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here in contrast, sand is a
very low CEC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is, again, something to keep in
mind if you are growing in a sand medium,
[SPEAKER_00]: that your CEC naturally is just going to
be lower by the inherent particle size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, low CEC, what does this cause?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, soils commonly sandy in texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: With low CEC, are more likely to develop
deficiencies in potassium and magnesium,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as other cations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, having that low cation exchange
doesn't allow this to be held very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't allow the plant to be able to
take them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some of the drawbacks to having
CEC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the nutrient deficiencies can
incur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can see the nutrient deficiencies
in CEC.
So, you can see the nutrient deficiencies
