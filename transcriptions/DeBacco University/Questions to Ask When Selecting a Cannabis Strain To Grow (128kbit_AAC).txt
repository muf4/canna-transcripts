[SPEAKER_00]: All right, in this tobacco university
video, we're going to be looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: questions to ask when selecting a cannabis
strain to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of options out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are some questions you could
should be asking yourself as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing your conditions, knowing your
environment to be able to try to select a
[SPEAKER_00]: strain that will grow well in your area?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into some of the questions to
consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some of them would be looking at what
are the first steps to determine is the
[SPEAKER_00]: area you will be growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: How large is it or how many plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this might play into the number of
varieties you might be choosing,
[SPEAKER_00]: the height of the plants, how large,
how many, if you're doing any trials,
[SPEAKER_00]: questions to realistically take a look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also want to have an idea if what
your goal end product will be can also
[SPEAKER_00]: influence your selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning, are you looking at the very end
to produce quality dry flower or will your
[SPEAKER_00]: end product be going for extraction?
[SPEAKER_00]: That may play into the type of flower that
you're looking at producing, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be kind of a flower that's going
to be visually appealing in large,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe, or maybe a lot of small flowers
that are ultimately going to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction because no one's actually going
to see the actual plant material at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the plant morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an important consideration because
when you're considering your area,
[SPEAKER_00]: you also want to consider the plant
morphology should be considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, the plant morphology is asking
questions like how tall will the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it need frequent pruning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it take a long time to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: When does it produce the maximum flower
production?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long should I let it go?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long after I flip it into a flowering
photo period will it be expected to
[SPEAKER_00]: expand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have a tendency to produce fewer
buds but larger buds, more buds and
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller?
[SPEAKER_00]: May that affect my pruning strategy?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, all of these ideas need to be
taken into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the basic morphology or
structure of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then just also considering your
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you not height limited?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can the plants get however tall that they
can?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a ceiling that's going to limit,
a grow tent potentially to limit that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not ceiling height limited,
this could lead to the selection of more
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa dominant strains because they have
a tendency to stretch more.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, just because you have the height
and particularly an outdoor situation
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't mean you need to necessarily
utilize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing outdoors, tall plants
may be subject to late season windstorm
[SPEAKER_00]: damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an important consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also more plant material may increase the
need for pruning, which may increase your
[SPEAKER_00]: expenses in both labor and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just because you're not height
limited does not mean you automatically
[SPEAKER_00]: select the largest, tallest growing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just an obvious consideration is are
you going to be growing indoors or are you
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be growing outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the location potential of
seasonal timing, particularly for outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: growing can influence the strain
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you go with, in the general
category, the photodependent, true sativas
[SPEAKER_00]: or indicas, or an autoflower, those
rudalis, where they're going to flower
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the number of days old and that
could influence based on the timing that
[SPEAKER_00]: you might be growing outdoors,
depending on what the conditions might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in an indoor environment,
you might be able to manipulate the
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting a little bit more than say the
outdoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the autoflower, remember you're going
to count the days for the autofowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They offer the advantage of knowing how
many days until flower and harvest for
[SPEAKER_00]: planting purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this will, this offers the
greatest yield since the plants tend to be
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's important consideration that,
oh, I don't have to worry about flower and
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can put them in my indoor, whether I got
some veg plants, I got some flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, the rudalis or the autofowers
won't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because they tend to have smaller
plants, will that offer the yield that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: These can be limiting as there's a set of
number or fixed days of plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you maximize each day?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also important consideration there
where because there's only a limited
[SPEAKER_00]: number of days, every day lost could be a
greater percentage of that plant's life or
[SPEAKER_00]: the photo period dependent ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could always delay or shift when you
change from a vegetative photo period to
[SPEAKER_00]: that flowering photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not select the highest CBD
producing plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the strains, I just want the
highest CBD producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most growers will easily be drawn to a
strain that has the biggest numbers of CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: or certain terpenes maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this should be a consideration
but not the only consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you need to know if you can maximize
plant production based on environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because a plant can produce a very
high CBD percentage does not mean it will
[SPEAKER_00]: produce given your certain growing
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may want to be selecting one that
morphologically is a better fit initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get kind of growing some of the
experiences with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not just getting the highest CBD
producer and maybe having to deal with a
[SPEAKER_00]: very hard to manage plant morphology or
one that requires special pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these are just some of the
questions you should be asking instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of randomly selecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of options which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be wise and select the correct
option that best fits your growing conditions.
