[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at the animal,
phylum, periphera, or sponges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the reason why I have this kind of
down here, and you'll see that in some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the videos I put below the name,
is kind of how to pronounce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parifera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of spelled out the way I can
kind of best put it down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not correct kind of English as far as
pronunciation goes, but it just gives you
[SPEAKER_00]: an idea of how to properly pronounce the
phylum here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're talking about sponges here,
periphera.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how they look.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be kind of the most famous
sponge you might be familiar with here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're going to be talking today about
the real sponges that live under the water
[SPEAKER_00]: and not necessarily in pineapples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a sponge is animals without tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the key indication here for what
defines a sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now sponges are animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the simplest of animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their bodies are a little more than masses
of specialized cells embedded in a
[SPEAKER_00]: gel-like matrix, and their clumps of cells
disassociated from a sponge can give rise
[SPEAKER_00]: to new sponges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we get a new sponge from an
original sponge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these clumps of cells kind of break
apart, and they reattach to an area,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they can regenerate another sponge
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're in the phylum here where
we're looking at the diverse amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: sponges that do occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while some are different colors and
some are brightly colored, some others are
[SPEAKER_00]: more of a dull color, and that's just
associated with that particular sponge
[SPEAKER_00]: variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a sponge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they don't have tissues,
so the body of the sponge is perforated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has many little pores here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a zoomed-in version of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A sponge is a filter feeder which traps
any food particles that pass by.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is again a zoomed-in version here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see our microvilli being able to
kind of filter out water that's being
[SPEAKER_00]: exchanged through the sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is typically why there's this long
kind of tube-like shape here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another example of just kind of how
they look.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're asymmetrical, heterotrophic,
it has no cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the no cell walls, again,
indicates because we are talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: animals, and they do need to consume food.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not making their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see indicated here are water in
and water out, so they are exchanging
[SPEAKER_00]: water from the outside environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a little short video here about
filtering barrel or chimney sponges,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is just another look here where
we're seeing water's coming in and going
[SPEAKER_00]: out the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it's coming in, all these little
hair-like features are kind of out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're kind of being used to try to
absorb or pick up food particles that pass
[SPEAKER_00]: by.
[SPEAKER_00]: This specialized cell type, see this is a
little bit more of a detailed version of
[SPEAKER_00]: zooming in here, where our water's being
pulled in through the sides, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: being exited out the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it's being pulled in, again,
these microvilli, all these little hairs,
[SPEAKER_00]: this high surface area, it's increasing
the odds that they come in contact with a
[SPEAKER_00]: food particle that might be in the water
here that's brought in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go over all the names and
the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to know the basics here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our specialized cell types,
even though no tissues are present,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're still taking in water that
contains food particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're filtering that food out,
and ideally the filtered water here is
[SPEAKER_00]: exiting out the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this gives you just a little bit
of an insight of how the simplest of all
[SPEAKER_00]: the animals lives here, the basic sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
