[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at Bohr
atomic structures and how to depict and
[SPEAKER_00]: draw out what's called a Bohr model of the
atom developed by Niels Bohr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, the Bohr model,
what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a simplified visual
representation of an atomic structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It assumes that electrons, represented by
the e-minus sign here, move in fixed
[SPEAKER_00]: orbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of those orbits represents an energy
level around the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are energy level one, energy level
two, three, four, five, and six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, electrons have to exist in one energy
level or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot be in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, the reason why I have the
picture here of the elevator is you can
[SPEAKER_00]: only go to certain levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go to, like, a half level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like electrons can't be at level two
and a half or two and a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be two or three, three or four,
four or one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be at very distinctive energy
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how we'd go about drawing the Bohr
model is we have some simple rules to
[SPEAKER_00]: follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, looking here, we want to draw the
nucleus, making sure to write down the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of neutrons and protons in the
center region here.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, step two is going to be to
look at drawing a circle or an orbit
[SPEAKER_00]: around the nucleus to represent the first
energy level, as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, energy level one can hold a maximum
of two electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, this is located closest to the
nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Level two can hold a maximum of eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three is eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eighteen, four is 32.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to focus mainly on the simpler
elements here so you get an understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you draw that circle around the
nucleus representing the first energy
[SPEAKER_00]: level, go through and electrons should be
drawn in pairs to make them easy to count
[SPEAKER_00]: and must fill an energy level before
moving to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, after you have two electrons filled up
in the first energy level, then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: move to the second.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the second is full, you can move to
the third and then so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's look at just a couple examples
here of periodic patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at group one, group 14,
17, and 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, group one, see the red is
representing the outermost shell of the
[SPEAKER_00]: valence electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In group one, each one of these has one
valence electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do notice is that lithium here
with its three electrons, two fill up the
[SPEAKER_00]: first energy level, and then one more that
goes on the second energy level.
[SPEAKER_00]: With Na, or sodium, two in that first
energy level, and we see one, two,
[SPEAKER_00]: three, four, five, six, seven,
eight in the second energy level.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that third energy level, we have one
more, so that one is being one valence
[SPEAKER_00]: electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do we know sodium has these 11
electrons?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have two here, plus eight,
which is nine, 10, 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 11 protons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in a neutral atom, there's going to be
11 electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing goes here for fluorine,
neon, and arion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're filling up that first energy level,
progressing to the second before we can go
[SPEAKER_00]: on to the third, if we have an electron
remaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a look at a couple of these models to
develop an understanding of how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's relatively easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to go through and look at some
of these examples and try them for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrogen, phosphorus, helium, neon,
and lithium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pause the video now and try them for
yourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope my students are pausing the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're pausing the video
or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, you've gone through and you've
taken those steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we have a way to check your answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, the answers that you came up
with, that you drew out on the Bohr models
[SPEAKER_00]: look similar to these.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't, go back and try to watch
and understand why they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, you can always email me or ask me
for questions and clarifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this develops a better idea of
understanding the Bohr model.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be out.
Thank you.
