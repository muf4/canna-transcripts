[SPEAKER_00]: This DeBacco University video is going to
go over an efficient way to fertilize your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to look specifically at a
fertigation setup and explanation using a
[SPEAKER_00]: Dosatron system, though any chemical
injector could be supplemented other than
[SPEAKER_00]: the name-brand Dosatrons that you'll see
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as mentioned before, Dosatron is
simply the name-brand for a chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: injector.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is often considered to be the
industry's standard and typically used in
[SPEAKER_00]: many greenhouse situations, but there are
other brands if you search for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This works in a similar way to most of the
other chemical injectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a water-powered, non-electric
chemical injector, so it makes it very
[SPEAKER_00]: great for transportation, for moving
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make it portable.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, they're in a fixed position,
but there's basically the power of water
[SPEAKER_00]: that's supplied through the irrigation
lines is what powers them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This offers an easy and reliable way to
accurately inject chemicals into the water
[SPEAKER_00]: lines and fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This class of injectors works by using a
volumetric proportioning, which helps
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain consistent mixing rates despite
changes that may occur in water pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: or in water flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does it actually work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we're kind of looking at the
exact kind of method here, this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dosatron here, we can see area one is the
water flow, so your water's flowing in
[SPEAKER_00]: here from the left to right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water enters the Dosatron body right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentrate is then pulled up through
the Dosatron, through the, you'd have a
[SPEAKER_00]: tank down here and it'd be pulled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentrate mixes with the incoming
water in this chamber right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the blended solution is discarded
out into the water line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll hear this kind of like click,
click, click in the video that Connor's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to show us, and that's basically
what that clicking noise is, is this kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of piston moving up and down, moving up to
bring up that concentrate and then going
[SPEAKER_00]: down, mixing it with the water,
and then ensuring that the consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: dosing is going out the lines from the
concentrated solution here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in this case, it's being hooked up to
a drip or emitter irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each container has a dedicated emitter
that can involve multiple outlets,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are especially important for larger
container plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, be sure you're checking for
sediments and any clogs that may occur in
[SPEAKER_00]: the system, because while this is very
efficient, there can be clogs that can
[SPEAKER_00]: occur, especially on long runs in a
greenhouse situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the Dosatron system as I said,
could be fixed on the wall or actually can
[SPEAKER_00]: be very mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very efficient method for dosing
fertilizer from stock tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This reduces the need to mix fertilizers
daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also ensure consistency of
nutrients delivered to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are water-driven piston pumps that
can be set to a ratio and adjust to the
[SPEAKER_00]: flow of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have an uneven water pressure,
they will adjust to ensure you're not over
[SPEAKER_00]: or under fertilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will also be familiar click sound
that will ensure the proper functioning
[SPEAKER_00]: can alert you to when something may not be
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're noticing that drop in water
pressure or water flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's a filter that's clogged.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all little indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get to know what the normal is,
you'll be able easily to tell what the
[SPEAKER_00]: abnormal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check valves are recommended or often
required to prevent backflow if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using a public water supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just keep that note in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's also more than fertilizer,
you can also clean through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this system can be used for fertilizing
plants as we see just a couple example
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same system could also be used for a
line cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we'll hear Connor mention that when
you're trying to prevent those clogs,
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent any sort of buildup of particulate
matter, you can take these out and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: put it through a line cleaner and then
clean all the lines out as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, offers great efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are importance for filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not just a chemical form of cleaning,
but filters are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-filters should be installed to catch
anything that comes in the lines before it
[SPEAKER_00]: reaches the Dosatron system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intake filters are basically at the very
top or at the very ends or at the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we can see down here in the concentrate
and they're tubes that connect to that
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there should be a filter here,
there should be a filter here and there
[SPEAKER_00]: should even be post-filters that can be
installed to ensure no large particulate
[SPEAKER_00]: goes out the emitters from the Dosatron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather clog filters and change the
filters out than have to worry about
[SPEAKER_00]: clogging all of my lines downstream of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So filters, while they might seem a little
annoying, if they're clogging,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'd rather be very easy to clean,
get into a pattern, then going through and
[SPEAKER_00]: clogging your entire system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a little bit about the
background of the system you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a part A, B, and C system.
[SPEAKER_00]: A is just a general fertilizer of 15,
12, 26.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part B is a calcium nitrate, 15-0-0.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's nitrogen, phosphorus,
and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bloom booster here, 10-20-30, 10%
nitrogen, 30% phosphorus, 20% potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when needed, this root drip to
kind of clean the lines here can also be
[SPEAKER_00]: added through this efficient Dosatron
chemie injector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure to check the product label for
suggested dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, it's stated for a 1 to 100
ratio, which is what the Dosatrons are
[SPEAKER_00]: often set at, and that's what we'll see
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says here, I add 13 ounces of
fertilizer to be added per gallon to the
[SPEAKER_00]: stock feeding tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be your concentrated
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given this standard ratio, it also makes
it easier for growers to make adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you want to inject at a 1
to 200 ratio, you double the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration, or if you had a 1 to 50
ratio, you basically have the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration as stated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've talked about it enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see it in action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear Connor go through the system
set up here so you can see and get
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with that clicking sound and kind
of walk us through this system so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see it in action now that you've learned
about the basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's everybody doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: So today, we are looking at our Dosatron.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our nutrient delivery system,
and this is how we pushed our nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: out to the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without having to constantly mix new
nutrients every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have three tanks, part A, part B,
and our bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our part A is a general kind of growing
ratio, mostly favoring the potassium and
[SPEAKER_01]: the phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our part B is a calcium nitrate,
high in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for our green growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if we look over here,
our bloom is a simple 1, 3, 2 mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is mostly for flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We turn this on for our flowering growths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how does it work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the Dosatron has three pistons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each piston is connected to our reservoir
tanks, and there's no electricity
[SPEAKER_01]: involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all powered by the flow of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, water comes in through our intake,
goes through the Dosatron, and the piston
[SPEAKER_01]: right here as the water, the force of the
water goes through it, the piston shoots
[SPEAKER_01]: up, releases a certain amount that you can
set right here of our nutrients into our
[SPEAKER_01]: mainstream of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can have, for my setup,
we can have three pistons going at once,
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing in three different types of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very cool, it's very efficient,
and you don't have to constantly be
[SPEAKER_01]: filling every day or every few days new
nutrients because you're running out so
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just use this and use your main
water supply and just push it all right
[SPEAKER_01]: out to the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some things that may happen when
using a Dosatron and the irrigation lines
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have out in the greenhouse,
you may get clogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when getting clogs, you can also use
the Dosatron to correct those clogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here we have hypochlorous acid,
root drip, it's called.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can actually set the Dosatron to
the root drip solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can accurately dose your water with
your hypochlorous acid, and that will push
[SPEAKER_01]: everything out through your irrigation
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, it's safe for your roots,
so it will clean the roots as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: along with pushing everything out through
the lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Dosatron is very useful because it can
be used for a variety of things,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the irrigation line cleaner,
you can also put, say, a foliar spray or
[SPEAKER_01]: some type of spray for insect control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can actually set the Dosatron,
make your own tank, and just use your
[SPEAKER_01]: Dosatron out in the greenhouse,
which is very useful and time-saving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to turn it on for you guys,
and you can listen to the satisfying click
[SPEAKER_01]: that these pistons make as it pushes in
the nutrients into our water.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our bypass switch, so this
controls water going in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is closed, it goes through the
Dosatron.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's open, it skips the Dosatron,
and I just get plain water out into the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just some air bubbles working
its way through the Dosatron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you just listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's pretty simple when you think
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing to note is that each outtake of
the Dosatron has filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in here, you can actually unscrew.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's filters in there that prevent any
particulates from getting into the
[SPEAKER_01]: Dosatron and messing with the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the end of our tubes, we have filters
on the very bottom in the tubes that
[SPEAKER_01]: prevents anything from our nutrients
getting in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have it installed currently,
but there would also be a filter in here
[SPEAKER_01]: that would filter out anything coming out
of the Dosatron into the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along with that, we have filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: More filters on the outtakes in the actual
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of filtration going on,
and that's to try to avoid that buildup in
[SPEAKER_01]: our drip lines that we use our
hypochlorous acid to fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing to note when using the
Dosatron, especially with your nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: and your other concentrates that you're
putting in your tanks, is that oftentimes
[SPEAKER_01]: the labels will have Dosatron
concentrations and ratios already printed
[SPEAKER_01]: and figured out for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, here on my Jaxx Part A,
we have a, for injectors at a one or one
[SPEAKER_01]: hundredth ratio, which we are all set.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 1% of this solution going through
into our main water supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for our Jaxx Part A, we would have 13
ounces per gallon of stock in this tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that ratio would be the correct amount
to accurately dose our entire greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's the Dosatron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
So that's our Jaxx Part A.
Thank you.
