[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, in this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to be exploring what the Philos
[SPEAKER_00]: Galaxy public database can tell you and
kind of the information you can gain from
[SPEAKER_00]: it that you have access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great way to kind of spend some
time researching some strings you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with and also discovering some
new ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just good to have an idea of the
power or what it's able to actually show
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, this is a link to the
website here and I want to make note that
[SPEAKER_00]: it may take a little time to load,
but it is worth the wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your browser may take a little time to
kind of might ask, do you want to wait?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always tell people it takes about like
30 seconds potentially to load.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it's a little bit less than that,
but just be patient with letting it load
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is loading a lot of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're here, I'm just going to give you
an example, kind of go through and I chose
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at none other than Charlotte's
web.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can clearly see that the,
you know, it's been shown to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy, have another video describing
some of the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're just going to look at one,
two, three, the four that I put little
[SPEAKER_00]: highlights around here that you can search
on a Charlotte's web here within the
[SPEAKER_00]: Philos Galaxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's interesting is while these are
all listed as Charlotte's web from
[SPEAKER_00]: different people that submitted it,
different companies that may have
[SPEAKER_00]: submitted it, they also have very
different results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to be an informed
consumer as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just looking at, you know,
some of the information that is provided
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, looking at our Charlotte's web,
I have the links to all these right here
[SPEAKER_00]: and we could see I keep them in the same
order here with the four listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with these four that were submitted by
different companies or people,
[SPEAKER_00]: ones listed just as anonymous,
looking at the closest genetic relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could see some have a very
diversified set of genetic relatives,
[SPEAKER_00]: some very simplified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here there's 58, four, 11, and two
relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are other strains related to?
[SPEAKER_00]: This can help start to develop a general
idea of the strains most closely related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some listed here have as few as two and as
many as 58.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, very diversified here in looking
at potential for closeness in genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if we look here at the kind of the
population profile here, where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at kind of this example here of
CBD, Skunk, Berry, OG Kush, Mini,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp, you know, what's kind of in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this indicates the heritage of the
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: What may it be related to based on the
genetic profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: One sample has nearly a complete relation
to CBD population while others have almost
[SPEAKER_00]: no relation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see this one here, definitely
high on CBD and a very little Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: In comparison, this one over here,
there's that CBD is that very thin little
[SPEAKER_00]: line right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very different here in the genotype
report, even though they all are listed as
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlotte's Web.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry if you're colorblind,
might be a little hard to distinguish some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these colors, but we can clearly
hopefully see that there's one really
[SPEAKER_00]: large bar here and that same bar is
represented by the very thin bar right
[SPEAKER_00]: over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to genetic novelty and this
provides an idea of how unique or rare the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics are compared to others in the
database.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rare genetics, I want to just make note,
are not necessarily better genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: so just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: All fall in the wide common range.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these are considered to be
common, not necessarily, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just gives you an idea of how common
those genetics may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the variation that occurs,
how diverse is the genetic profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that the lower the variation,
the more likely the plant in a population
[SPEAKER_00]: will perform is similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this means, if you have a high degree
of variation and you grow a lot of plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to see a very high amount of
variability from one plant to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: The middle two strains offer a more
consistency, which can be especially
[SPEAKER_00]: important in large populations of plants
being grown, in the sense that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be more uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have massively tall
and then short plants, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have a little bit more
uniformity across the field there in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to genetically distant
varieties, so if you're looking for a
[SPEAKER_00]: different genetic base to cross,
this provides some suggestions for strains
[SPEAKER_00]: that can help increase the variation in
resulting offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only cushions appear in all reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it can kind of just give an idea if
you're looking at breeding or getting into
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeding aspect, what might you breed
into it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's important that all of these that
we've been looking at here are all
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlotte's or listed as Charlotte's Web,
but we can see through all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: reports, the variability that we get in
all of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to note that there is this
variability, even though everything is
[SPEAKER_00]: called Charlotte's Web.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was why I make note of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This quick comparison hopefully shows the
great variability that can exist for plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material that may all have the same name,
so buyer view where.
[SPEAKER_00]: Asking for a COA, certificate of
authenticity, and other supporting
[SPEAKER_00]: documentation is important to make sure
you know what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just sticking with the Charlotte's
Web theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all Charlotte's Web.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's the book from 1952.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the 1973 film.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the 2006 film.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these are Charlotte's Web,
but all these are very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with the cannabis strains as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're paying for your getting,
or at least you know what you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: with some sort of certificate and
documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to you, the buyer or purchaser,
to request this documentation that
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully can be provided by who's ever
supplying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you always wanted to check,
you could send the sample out yourself and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully it comes back with what the
person who sent it to you, the supplier
[SPEAKER_00]: who sent it to you, said that you're
paying for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, buyer beware.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always seek documentation to ensure you're
getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you
soon.
