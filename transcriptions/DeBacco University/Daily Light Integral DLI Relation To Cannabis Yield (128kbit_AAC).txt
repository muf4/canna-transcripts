[SPEAKER_00]: On this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to go over the daily light
[SPEAKER_00]: integral, typically abbreviated DOI,
in relation to cannabis yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Natalie will be discussing this as far
as defining it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also provide you with some
information on how you can calculate it
[SPEAKER_00]: for your grow area.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's learn a little bit more
about the daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the daily light integral or DLI,
represents or describes the total number
[SPEAKER_00]: of photosynthetically active photons in
the 400 to 700 nanometers or par range
[SPEAKER_00]: that are delivered to a specific area over
a 24 hour period.
[SPEAKER_00]: For outdoor locations, this will be season
and weather dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for indoor locations, it can more
easily be calculated by simply knowing the
[SPEAKER_00]: light's output in the hours that the
lights spend in the on position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for our outdoor locations,
a little bit more of confusion in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense that knowing what season,
knowing what location, knowing where or
[SPEAKER_00]: what degree of latitude can also impact
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got to take into account a little
bit more for calculating this for an
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're going through that
calculation process, DLI is the sum of the
[SPEAKER_00]: per second PPFD, that's photosynthetically
photon flux density, measurements during
[SPEAKER_00]: the 24 hour period.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the photosynthetic light intensity
remains constant as with artificial
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting units for a defined time period,
which is a duration, then the DLI can
[SPEAKER_00]: easily be calculated because you have your
lights on for a certain period of time
[SPEAKER_00]: producing this amount of PPFD,
it makes the calculation step fairly easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor locations, as I said, more
complicated and require more data
[SPEAKER_00]: collection over a period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the end result can be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this kind of calculation of our
DLI, which is the PPFD times the minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: or hours and times the seconds to get
times the photo period and then divide it
[SPEAKER_00]: by this one million micromoles per mole to
get the kind of calculate a DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll be going through this and giving
you a easy math equation so you can apply
[SPEAKER_00]: it to your own situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking again at the outdoor
location, the PPFD in micromoles per meter
[SPEAKER_00]: squared per second, the range is zero to
2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be no light to full
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So full sunlight would be that 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember that sunlight is subjected to
continual variability due to clouds
[SPEAKER_00]: passing by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see the time of day at every
10 minute interval, taking a reading,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can see a cloud definitely came by
here, and we can see getting closer to
[SPEAKER_00]: sunset here as the angle of the sun is
changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For artificial lighting, 500 micromoles
per meter squared per second should be
[SPEAKER_00]: considered the absolute minimum to ensure
when you're growing indoors, you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be at least 510, really want to be higher
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does PPFD versus DLI, what's kind
of the comparison here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for PPFD, it's the rate of photons
per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to think about it is how fast is
it raining per second?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it kind of a light little drizzle or is
it a downpour?
[SPEAKER_00]: DLI would be the sum of photons in a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be like asking the
question, how much did it rain today?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the total?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how we can compare these kind
of point in time readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's raining a little, it's raining a
lot to kind of, oh, how much rain did we
[SPEAKER_00]: get today?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we compare PPFD versus DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're looking at the target DLI,
daily light integral, this can vary with
[SPEAKER_00]: the stage of plant development.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if a grower is able to keep all
other plant requirements at the optimum,
[SPEAKER_00]: the DLI can be increased above the
suggested levels to maximize production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, yes, you want to probably have a
little bit less light on your clones or
[SPEAKER_00]: newly emerged seedlings and increase that
as it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you think about an outdoor plant,
man, since that thing germinated,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting right into that full amount
of sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure we're reducing the
stresses on those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we want to maximize production,
you use these kind of as a minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can always increase them more,
again, assuming you have all other plant
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements at optimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: For outdoor perspective on our DLI here,
we kind of see a little bit of a kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison here of the different months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that summer, full sun days,
DLI can reach 60 moles per meter squared
per minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The image shows the amount of light
received across the United States each
[SPEAKER_00]: month.
[SPEAKER_00]: During fall and winter, latitude has a
strong influence on DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the higher up you are versus the
closer to the equator will greatly impact
[SPEAKER_00]: DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind that you do have
these variables, particularly when growing
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors or growing in a greenhouse where
you're dependent on some of the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: sun as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I said there would be calculations
and helping you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example of one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a plant receiving 1,000 micromoles per
meter squared per second for 20 hours will
[SPEAKER_00]: have a DLI of how much?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the answer is 72 moles per meter
squared per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that we're running lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep this indoors to keep
it a little bit easier at 1,000 micromoles
[SPEAKER_00]: per meter squared per second for 20 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start with the output, 1,000
micromoles per meter per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at converting this to hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this many seconds in an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to cross our units out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we want to convert our micromoles to
moles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get at this rate, we're producing
3.6 moles per meter squared per hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take that 3.6 moles per meter
squared per hour and want to convert that
[SPEAKER_00]: to the days, the moles per day,
because we're running one day as 20 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our moles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 20 hours in one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's allowing us to cancel the hours
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're simply left with 72 moles per
meter squared per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, how do we go about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: We take our output and we need our output
and we need our time that they were run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our output.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go through and we calculate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we go through and we take that
3.6 moles per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are running it for 20 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that plant will have received 72 moles
per meter squared per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at another example.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're running that same 1,000
micromoles per second, but now only for a
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 hour day or a full day, a flower cycle,
how does this change?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course it would be less as we
expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is 43.2 moles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our output in micromoles per
meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to convert this to moles per hour,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go through these calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still producing the same 3.6 moles
per meter squared per hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we flip back for just one second,
we notice that the output is the same per
[SPEAKER_00]: hour, 3.6 moles, 3.6 moles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we get this smaller number?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, remember we're only running this for
12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take our 3.6 moles per meter squared
per hour, multiply it now by a day is
[SPEAKER_00]: defined as 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we get the 43.2 moles per
meter squared per day for our DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how does this light intensity relate
to cannabis production?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to go back and circle back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we've got our DLI calculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that good, bad, or indifferent?
[SPEAKER_00]: So at a certain point, in order for plants
to take advantage of higher intensities of
[SPEAKER_00]: light, there needs to be carbon dioxide
supplementation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If light is increased beyond this amount,
the CO2 becomes a limiting factor and
[SPEAKER_00]: plants will not be able to use extra light
levels, making it a waste to produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically for indoor situations,
you're paying for this light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure it's efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The threshold for optimum growth and
photosynthesis is a DLI of 65 moles per
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of see this kind of like kind of
leveling off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Error bars here are at the 95% commas
interval for each treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see our DLI, we see our yield here,
looking at different cannabis strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep that in mind when you go
through and calculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a little comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really looking at that threshold of
optimum being 65 per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So light intensity during veg stage of
cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since vegetative phases can have some
variability due to the grow duration of
[SPEAKER_00]: light to dark, to the maximums are
provided below here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice that if you have lights that
produce less intensity, they need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: run for a longer duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this is possible in the vegetative
stage, the light duration is fixed in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure you're getting
high quality lights to particularly light
[SPEAKER_00]: and maximize that flower time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light dark schedule and PPFD
recommendation without CO2 enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at if you're running a 24 hour
day, I give some examples here to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: reach that 65 moles per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you better have lights that are
producing at least 752 micromoles per
[SPEAKER_00]: meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: For an 18-6 schedule, you want to be at
900 micromoles and still you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be closer at 65, but you're only still
going to be producing 58 moles per day to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a flowering photo period comparison,
that 12-12 hour schedule at 900.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we were producing 58.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we're only doing a 12 hour day,
now we're only going to have a DLI of 39
[SPEAKER_00]: moles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light dark schedule and PPFD
recommendations with CO2 enrichment to
[SPEAKER_00]: reach that target of that 65 moles per
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running lights for 24 hours,
you only need a light that would produce
[SPEAKER_00]: 752 micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: For if you're running at 18-6,
you could want a light that's producing
[SPEAKER_00]: just over a thousand micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the flowering photo period,
we need a light producing 1505 micromoles
[SPEAKER_00]: per meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what light intensity you're
producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light intensity during flower phase of
cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that flowering phase is that critical
flower phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it's defined only as a 12 hour of a
continuous light duration remains the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is variable is the intensity,
which impacts the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're running for 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The minimum light level PPFD of at least
510 micromoles per meter squared per
[SPEAKER_00]: second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Optum range without CO2 enrichment would
be a PPFD of 800 to a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because remember without CO2, max
intensity that plants can use is no higher
[SPEAKER_00]: than 900 micromoles per second squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're kind of like limited capped at
that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you are enriching your row
area with CO2, PPFD of a thousand to 1500
[SPEAKER_00]: plus micromoles per meter squared per
second can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does not seem to be a saturation point
even up to 1800 micromoles per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can theoretically go even higher
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind natural sun would be 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything higher than that probably not
going to get from indoor lighting or
[SPEAKER_00]: really at that point and probably be
excessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're trying to determine where
that light saturation point is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, you could give your plants here
1500 if without CO2, but you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be wasting that light because the plants
are not able to utilize it because in that
[SPEAKER_00]: situation there would be carbon dioxide
limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's just a general quick little
summary reference chart looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: hours run, looking at the PPFD produced,
and then kind of trying to get an idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: the DLI as a quick little comparison here
just to give you some idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this darker red region here would be
over that 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're shooting for that kind of
60-65 ish range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the information presented here,
I want to thank a couple people just to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're interested in this and want
to do some more further research,
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend you kind of search up some of
these names.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might find some very interesting
publications, some very interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: articles, some very interesting research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And data presented to help you make,
again, informed positions and ask good
[SPEAKER_00]: questions and to be able to understand
this lighting to help you maximize your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's yield.
