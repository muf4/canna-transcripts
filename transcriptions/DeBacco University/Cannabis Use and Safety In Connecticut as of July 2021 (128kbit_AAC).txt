[SPEAKER_00]: This DeBaco University video is going to
get into cannabis use and safety in
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecticut as of the laws in place as of
July 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you may have some questions
regarding cannabis use and safety in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of Connecticut as of July 2021,
and this video will provide you with some
[SPEAKER_00]: information on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're from another state, this might
help just provide some general guidelines
[SPEAKER_00]: and get some details of Connecticut that
might be applicable to other states and
[SPEAKER_00]: areas as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the Connecticut example,
they have the link right here to the
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this information presented is based on
the cannabis information provided by the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of Connecticut, July 1st or July
8th, 2021 timeframe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only applicable for Connecticut and
is subject to change at any time,
[SPEAKER_00]: so please check your local and current
regulations as this is intended to be used
[SPEAKER_00]: as a point in time general example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So questions that are commonly asked is,
well one is, are there packaging or
[SPEAKER_00]: labeling standards for CBD and legal delta
products within Connecticut?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for products below 0.3% dry weight,
THC limit, all federal and state laws
[SPEAKER_00]: concerning labeling and packaging still
apply to any food, drug, and dietary
[SPEAKER_00]: supplements such as the Connecticut Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we can see an example of a label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many other states, this is the same thing,
labeling is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will cannabis products in the state
regulated markets be safe?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is looking at for the state of
Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this legalization imposes strong
requirements for product safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Products will have to be lab tested and
will have strict packaging as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: labeling standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Edible cannabis products are limited to
five milligrams of THC per serving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most other products are subject to a
potency cap as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Products will be in child safe packaging
and product types that appeal to children
[SPEAKER_00]: are banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just an example here of
companies now producing child safe
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging or something in that form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different companies have different ideas,
different packagings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the goal here is to limit or make them
child safe packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does the law keep our roads safe?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very common question asked by a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while there is no test for cannabis
impairment like the breathalyzer that
[SPEAKER_00]: police often use for alcohol impairment
can still be recognized via driver
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through roadside sobriety tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: The law steps up police training on
impaired driving and also strengthens the
[SPEAKER_00]: impaired driving laws, which will help
keep drivers impaired by any drug,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just cannabis, off the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drivers who do not submit to a drug
influence evaluation from a police officer
[SPEAKER_00]: trained as a drug recognition expert may
have their license suspended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Details of that can go by state and
details of that would be within the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where can I use cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of the last little question here is
just, well, okay, where could I actually
[SPEAKER_00]: use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this comes down to conducting your
city or town for more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, you won't be able to smoke or
vape cannabis anywhere you can't smoke or
[SPEAKER_00]: vape tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just kind of your general
guideline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cities and towns may enact ordinances to
regulate whether and where cannabis can be
[SPEAKER_00]: consumed in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: At home, landlords may impose smoking and
vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, may prohibit smoking and
vaping, but they generally may not
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibit the possession or the consumption
of either forms of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis will be also prohibited in state
parks, as well as on state beaches and
[SPEAKER_00]: waterways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is just Connecticut using
this as an example, but this may give you
[SPEAKER_00]: some insight to what one state's doing,
because it may influence what other states
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep this in mind as far as the
ever changing and world of laws and
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations centered around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
