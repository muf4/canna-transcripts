[SPEAKER_00]: On this Tobacco University video,
we're going over particle size and texture
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis that you may get with your soil
test report.
[SPEAKER_00]: The image here shows a nice little
relative comparison of the larger sand
[SPEAKER_00]: particle, the midsize silt particle,
and the small little particle here of
[SPEAKER_00]: clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this video is going to go over
particle size and also texture analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: importance in regards to a soil test
report.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, soil texture, when we're
looking at the texture of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, soil texture is a classification
instrument used both in field and
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratories to determine soil classes
based on their physical structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A soil texture analysis determines the
relative proportions of sand, silt,
[SPEAKER_00]: and clay in a sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: The textural class is based on the USDA's
textural triangle classification,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there are 12 different textural
classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show a graph of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil texture can be determined using
qualitative methods, such as texture by
[SPEAKER_00]: feel, and also quantitative methods,
which includes the use of a hydrometer
[SPEAKER_00]: method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing that soil's texture can help gauge
the required inputs and potential
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity of a soil for crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shows the sand, silt,
and clay particles in suspension,
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing the settle out using a hydrometer
here to kind of get an idea of exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: where levels that it's reading,
and it will be taking usually very early
[SPEAKER_00]: on, and then it'll let it sit for about
two hours, and they'll take another
[SPEAKER_00]: reading, and then they'll compare those
two readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see this in action,
I have a path of soil through a soil test
[SPEAKER_00]: lab where they'll show you this exact
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the soil triangle, the triangle is
used to determine the classification of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil based on the percentage of clay,
silt, and sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice how the percentage of clay has a
large impact on the soil's classification,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clay, clay, clay, all these would be
considered a form of clay, and it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: vast majority of this triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is simply due to the small particle
size resulting in a high surface area to
[SPEAKER_00]: volume ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how you try to work this is you look
at the percentage of clay on this side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the triangle with the percentage silt and
the percentage of sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if I had 60% clay,
and I come down here, and then I'm looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at, we could say 30% silt, and then for
sand, we have only 10% sand here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where those would converge would be
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be considered a clay soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see again, we have other
options here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we only had 10% clay, and then we had
20% sand, we would then have to have 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would classify us as a silt loam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the way you read these
three sides of this soil triangle to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the proper classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now sand, silt, and clay particles,
a loam is often classification given to
[SPEAKER_00]: soil that is not predominantly sand,
silt, or clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just has a little different
characteristics to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see clay, we typically think of
it having a very sticky appearance,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of that ability to kind of plate on
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are in sand is kind of composed of
relatively speaking large particles that
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to fall apart from each other and be
independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now true sandy soil has the largest
particle sizes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that sand may not just be a
single type of snow, it could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sandy soils though are known to have good
aeration and drainage, but a limited
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to hold water and also nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The composition of sand varies depending
on the local rock sources and conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the most common constitutes of sand in
inland continental settings is a
[SPEAKER_00]: non-tropical coast settings is silica,
which is silicon dioxide or SiO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually in the form of quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now silt is a midsize particle and offers
properties in between sand and clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silt has a moderate surface area with
typically a non-sticky plastic feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silt usually has a flowery feel when it's
dry and kind of a slippery feel when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silt can be visually observed by hand lens
exhibiting a sparkling appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that in between kind of soil
there and typically more sought after soil
[SPEAKER_00]: for growing crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loam soil, loam by weight is a mineral
composition, which is about 40,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40, 20, concentration sand, silt and clay
respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: These proportions can vary to a degree,
however, and result in different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: loamy soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, there's sandy loam,
silty loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam and
[SPEAKER_00]: silty clay loam and loam.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice in that kind of read out there,
it's important of the order that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: presented as well to classify,
to most precisely classify the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that the primary differential loam in
most dictionaries is soil with humus or
[SPEAKER_00]: organic content and no mention of particle
size texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is definition used by many
gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Agriculture textural
classification triangle, the only soil
[SPEAKER_00]: that is not predominantly sand,
silt and clay is called loam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loam soils generally contain more
nutrients, moisture and humus than sandy
[SPEAKER_00]: soils and have better drainage and
infiltration of water and air than silt
[SPEAKER_00]: and clay rich soils and are easier to till
than clay soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're simply called to be gross with
freedom as being less heavy, less likely
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of clump together, allow water to
drain a little bit better, definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to a clay and also allow better
aeration of the root zone of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to our clay soils and our clay
soils have the smallest particle size and
[SPEAKER_00]: have the greatest impact on soil
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high surface area allow them to hold
nutrients well, which reduces the chance
[SPEAKER_00]: of leaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this soil can hold water,
which can result in plants being more
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to be waterlogged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when clay soils dries, it will crack
and be more difficult than other types to
[SPEAKER_00]: rehydrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell me if true clay soils have
the picture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start at one end of the field and
you walk your way to the other end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: field and you're six inches taller by the
time you get to the end, that's because
[SPEAKER_00]: all the clay builds up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a true clay soil because it
has a tendency definitely to stick
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do we determine these different
textures by feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's this ribbon test and go
through the exact kind of process here
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you want to go through and read
it, you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're basically placing soil in the
palm of your hand, adding some water and
[SPEAKER_00]: kneading that soil with smooth plastic
consistency to like a putty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you want to see if does the soil
remain a ball when you kind of squeeze it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does, you go on to these next steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't, it might be too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have to re-wet it or you might
be simply dealing with a very sandy soil
[SPEAKER_00]: where it can't really hold itself
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a ball, open it up and it falls
apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be done with this sandy soil if
the moisture is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does form a ball, then you want to
go to the next step where you want to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at does it kind of form a ribbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you moisten the soil and kind of get
it to form a ribbon?
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on the length of the ribbon that
you can get will determine the higher
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the longer the ribbon, the more clay
percentage you have in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can go to the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it feel gritty?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it feel smooth?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can help you just do a quick test
in a field as far as determining what type
[SPEAKER_00]: of soil you might be dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this takes some practice,
but you can kind of go through here with
[SPEAKER_00]: some soil you may have locally and what
you may know the type of and see if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can follow this process there to determine
the texture by feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now soil texture is favorable for growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A loam or a silty loam by weight,
again, it's about 40% sand, 40% silt,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20% clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Variants in these proportions result in
different types of loam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, listed them out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sandy loam, silty loam, clay loam,
sandy clay loam, silty clay loam,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just plain loam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these are different soil
textures, but all of these in general
[SPEAKER_00]: would be considered at least initially
favorable for growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now lastly, soil texture for the long
term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming no major modification to the
soil, the texture class should remain
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly consistent, so it's not necessary
to need to check each soil test the grower
[SPEAKER_00]: takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you should be kind of going through
and testing it for pH and nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: soil texture you can kind of do once,
and that's probably not going to change to
[SPEAKER_00]: a great degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when initially performing a soil
test for a new or prospective area,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a good idea to include this test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this again just shows again how you
would read that with the different
[SPEAKER_00]: percentages to determine your exact
classification of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming you don't do any major large
amendments of any kind, this should stay
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty consistent and something you should
know before purchasing a field or growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in a field so that you can make the best
adjustments and know what you're walking
[SPEAKER_00]: into before the plants even go in the
ground.
