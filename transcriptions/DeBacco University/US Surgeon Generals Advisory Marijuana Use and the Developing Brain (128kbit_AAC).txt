[SPEAKER_00]: So this tobacco University video is going
to look at the US Surgeon General's
[SPEAKER_00]: advisory regarding marijuana use in the
developing brain All right, let's get into
[SPEAKER_00]: US Surgeon General's advisory regarding
marijuana use in the developing brain So
[SPEAKER_00]: first off marijuana use during pregnancy
and a lot of information is going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: proper citations that you're welcome to
look at marijuana is used during pregnancy
[SPEAKER_00]: can affect the developing fetus and THC
can enter the fetal brain from the
[SPEAKER_00]: mother's bloodstream It may disrupt the
endocannabinoid system, which is important
[SPEAKER_00]: for a healthy pregnancy and fetal brain
development Studies have shown that
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana use in pregnancy is associated
with adverse outcomes including lower
[SPEAKER_00]: birth weight the Colorado pregnancy risk
assessment monitoring system reported that
[SPEAKER_00]: Maternal marijuana use was associated with
a 50% increase in risk of low birth weight
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless of the maternal age Race
ethnicity education and also tobacco use
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of important there and a little
concerning We look at marijuana during
[SPEAKER_00]: adolescence So the human brain continues
to develop from before birth into the mid
[SPEAKER_00]: 20s and is vulnerable to the effects of
addictive substances And again,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is more than cannabis, but this is
also looking at THC and marijuana in
[SPEAKER_00]: general here We can kind of see different
regions of the brain and how THC may
[SPEAKER_00]: affect those so THC can affect areas of
our brain that control balance and
[SPEAKER_00]: coordination as we kind of like many of
the green areas then went under the
[SPEAKER_00]: influence of the frontal cortex to be
located in this area Decision-making
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes impaired marijuana can affect the
frontal cortex involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: decision-making process and THC affects
the cerebral which can dull the feeling of
[SPEAKER_00]: pain all things that can affect
particularly teenager adolescent's brain
[SPEAKER_00]: in addition Frequent marijuana use can
during adolescence is associated With a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch of other challenges as well
changes of the brain involved in attention
[SPEAKER_00]: memory decision-making and also motivation
Deficits in attention and memory have been
[SPEAKER_00]: detected in marijuana using teens even
after a month of abstinence impaired
[SPEAKER_00]: learning and adolescence chronic use is
linked to declines in IQ school
[SPEAKER_00]: performance that jeopardizes professional
as well as social achievements and life
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfaction increased rates of school
absence and dropout as well as Suicide
[SPEAKER_00]: attempts all negative impacts of chronic
marijuana use during adolescence There's
[SPEAKER_00]: also psychotic disorders as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The risk of early onset psychotic
disorders such as schizophrenia is
[SPEAKER_00]: possible The risk for these disorders
increases with the frequency of use the
[SPEAKER_00]: potency of the marijuana product in the
age at first use decreased And as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: other substances use there can be
compounding effects as well So again,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are just reasons for looking at and
reasons really for concern Now lastly
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to look at teens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2017 teens the age 12 to 17 reported
frequent use of marijuana showed a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: and thirty percent greater likelihood of
Misusing opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is based on the information presented
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also teens mixing prescription opioids
with other substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also sadly works the other way those
teens reported co-ingestion of
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription opioids with other drugs were
eight times more likely to abuse marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: so it can worsen Work both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important to realize that the
brain does continue development in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mid-20s and U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surgeon General does have some concerns
posted here regarding cannabis and THC as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as other products as well So again,
just take this all into consideration for
[SPEAKER_00]: any drug you're looking at potentially
consuming
