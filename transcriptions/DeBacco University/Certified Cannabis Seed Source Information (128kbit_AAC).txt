[SPEAKER_00]: All right, in this tobacco university
video, we're going to be looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: certified cannabis seed source information
and using one example here to provide you
[SPEAKER_00]: with some information, some specifics,
so you can become an informed consumer and
[SPEAKER_00]: know what you're purchasing and ensure
you're getting quality cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get started with this
tobacco university video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, check your state for an
approved list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I chose Connecticut here to use as an
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: The information is easily found on the
web, so make sure you're checking your own
[SPEAKER_00]: area to make sure you're complying with
those guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're from the state of
Connecticut, make sure that you're also
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping up to date with the latest
requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just using this as an example,
here certified seed or clones or proper
[SPEAKER_00]: yields obtained from a certified seed must
be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be approved list here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certified seed means hemp seed for which a
certificate or other instrument has been
[SPEAKER_00]: issued by an agency authorized under the
laws of the state, territory or possession
[SPEAKER_00]: of the United States to officially certify
hemp seed and that has standards and
[SPEAKER_00]: procedures approved by United States
Secretary of Agriculture to assure the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic purity and identify if hemp seeds
certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that sounds like a lot of long
legality information, but this is
[SPEAKER_00]: important that you're following the rules
and requirements set by your state.
[SPEAKER_00]: The department will accept varieties that
have been approved by the State Department
[SPEAKER_00]: of Agriculture for use in their hemp
growing programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another important note to make you
aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Varieties listed as prohibited or a
variety of concern may not be used,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly if those have been identified
by some previous testing or information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you as a grower want to know this seed
source, and that's true in any regards,
[SPEAKER_00]: but especially with cannabis seed
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the grower application, you must
provide information considering the source
[SPEAKER_00]: of your seed or proper yields used.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must provide evidence that the seed or
proper yields are certified by a state
[SPEAKER_00]: designation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed certification agencies are approved
for cultivation by another state,
[SPEAKER_00]: territory or possession, copy of seed
label, if you intend to cultivate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep this in mind that having
this documentation, have this information,
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing that that variety has been
approved is all important and is the
[SPEAKER_00]: growers' right.
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the State Department of Agriculture
official publication, so there is some
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful information here in the sense
that below are examples of documentation
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use to support your hemp seed
selection and upload as part of your hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: grower license application, at least in
this example for the state of Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: A company supplying your seed should be
able to provide you with evidence that the
[SPEAKER_00]: specific variety or cultivar has been
approved for use in a state with a hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: production program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't provide you with this sort of
documentation or paperwork, probably not a
[SPEAKER_00]: good idea to be purchasing from them in
the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, you must maintain records
that include invoices of any certification
[SPEAKER_00]: information that accompanied the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's very important as hemp
cannabis growers to be very organized as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just an example of a seed
label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there's not necessarily all
100% standardized, but example labels to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide an idea of what to look for when
purchasing seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some seeds may have flashy packaging,
but these are what is required for
[SPEAKER_00]: documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you're looking at the percent pure
seed, the dormant or hard seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: potential weed seeds, if any noxious seeds
were found, the germination percentage,
[SPEAKER_00]: which remember is different than
emergence, the origin, the test date,
[SPEAKER_00]: the net weight, and there's some
individual information here blocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also knowing the lot number can be
important in case there's a problem with
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can refer back to the person you
purchased it from and quote the lot
[SPEAKER_00]: number.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may also get some different kind of
information as well as potential strain
[SPEAKER_00]: that was crossed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said germination purity, potential
CBDs, THC percentages, again, keeping that
[SPEAKER_00]: equal to under 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you're federally classified as
hemp and not marijuana, as well as some
[SPEAKER_00]: other information here, potentially
spacing and height and root system can all
[SPEAKER_00]: be advantageous to the grower,
but just important to ensure you have some
[SPEAKER_00]: of this documentation so you can provide
it as part of your application and upon
[SPEAKER_00]: request so you don't get into trouble in
the long run.
