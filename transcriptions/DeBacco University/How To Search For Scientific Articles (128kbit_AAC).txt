[SPEAKER_00]: Here we give you a brief idea on how to
search for scientific articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter what search engine you use,
going through and finding good scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: articles can be a little bit of a
challenge or a daunting task, at least
[SPEAKER_00]: initially, which I think you'll find is
actually quite easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I suggest starting with
Google Scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go right into Google, type in Google
Scholar, and then use that subset search
[SPEAKER_00]: engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply type Google Scholar and it should
come right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I like you starting with
this is it's a great user-friendly search
[SPEAKER_00]: engine that's also free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very powerful tool to at least find
some of the articles that are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, you'll find many articles that you
have to pay for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, once you find that
article's name and title, you might have
[SPEAKER_00]: full access to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are at a university, university
libraries typically have access to a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of those for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is often an underutilized resource by
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great resource, but often can be a
challenge with the actual search aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So type like Google Scholar because it'll
give you the title, the author,
[SPEAKER_00]: some dates, more powerful tools that you
can use to pinpoint and find the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: article.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do find that information via
another search engine, it can really
[SPEAKER_00]: improve the efficiency of a
university-based library if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to so many.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the rare case that you can't find it,
but you want full access to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you do email the library, in a lot of
cases, you might be able to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: article or search it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just things to keep into
consideration because having access and
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing where to find scientific research
can be a very powerful tool, not only in
[SPEAKER_00]: your undergraduate and graduate career,
but just in general to be able to read
[SPEAKER_00]: really detailed and current resource and
information about topics that allow you to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop a good interest in, to get some
materials and methods, and looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: other sources that they use can really
expand your knowledge on any particular
[SPEAKER_00]: subject.
Thank you.
