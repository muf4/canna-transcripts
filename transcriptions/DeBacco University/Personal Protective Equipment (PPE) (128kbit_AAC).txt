[SPEAKER_01]: Now, while this will be a very short
summary here of personal protective
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment, or PPE, I thought it was worth
a standalone video lecture here.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the sense that PPE, you'll typically
see that abbreviation where we're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at pesticide applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have the proper PPE.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it stands for personal
protective equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see some examples of that here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, PPE, this equipment is designed to
protect the individual from injury or
[SPEAKER_01]: infection, also keeping the person or the
applicator separate from whatever they're
[SPEAKER_01]: applying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the exact form of equipment used is
determined by the situation the individual
[SPEAKER_01]: will be facing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, though, you'll see some sort of
head covering.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see long sleeves, long pants,
boots, and typically, a respirator
[SPEAKER_01]: involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want to say the exact form.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different respirators for
different types of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are just particulate respirators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some might be two specific chemicals that
might be evident here of the person making
[SPEAKER_01]: the application.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just understand that PPE, common
abbreviation used, personal protection
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're reading the label on a
pesticide, be mindful of what they
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend and make sure you have that on
hand to separate yourself from what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: applying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
