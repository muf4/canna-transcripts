[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here I'm going to attempt to
give a brief overview of the skeletal
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here, hopefully,
you'll be pondering wonderful thoughts
[SPEAKER_00]: about the skeletal system, and by the end,
you'll be feeling like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I included some videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, in the description,
there's a link to the slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some YouTube videos you can
watch about ones on Britain's Got Talent,
[SPEAKER_00]: showing someone who's very flexible,
and ones here at looking at neck
[SPEAKER_00]: stretching in Myanmar and some of the
changes that occur physiologically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reminder that, remember about the
homologous and analogous structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this kind of the same picture here,
comparing homologous structures,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they have similar structure,
but different function, and analogous
[SPEAKER_00]: structures, keep in mind, have different
structure, but similar functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These homologous structures, comparing the
function of the phalanges in the human to
[SPEAKER_00]: the bat, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just showing one here,
where we're looking at the homologous,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is right up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans, the phalanges, those are your
fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're used for compared to the bat,
again, ours is for gripping and grabbing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the bat, it would be for flying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, changes in the human skeleton that do
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: In embryos, the skeleton is primarily
hyaline cartilage.
[SPEAKER_00]: During development, much of this cartilage
is replaced by bone, not all of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but much of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is cartilage that does remain in the
body, and that's like, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: your ears, your nose, and your throat
region, and also within your rib cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's different areas also within
your joints, you can still have some
[SPEAKER_00]: remaining cartilage.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the development of the skeletal
system, at birth, the skull bones are not
[SPEAKER_00]: quite complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually kind of room for them to
move, and there's actually, they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: quite fully fused yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adult human only has 206 bones that
have grown together from about 300 bones
[SPEAKER_00]: at birth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within the skull, just as an example,
bones are joined by fibrous membranes
[SPEAKER_00]: called fontanels.
[SPEAKER_00]: These fontanels are completely replaced
with bone within the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within two years after birth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a very early newborn,
there'll actually be little soft spots in
[SPEAKER_00]: their head, and those are the fontanels.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the gap between the plates within
their skull that haven't quite fused yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's to help with the birthing process,
and also allow the brain to grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, functions of the skeletal system in
general might be, some of them might be
[SPEAKER_00]: very obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They support the framework, create all the
soft organs that you have, that helps
[SPEAKER_00]: provide them with protection, in case of
brain or spinal cord or vital organs,
[SPEAKER_00]: that spinal cord runs right down the
vertebrae, all encased in bone there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's responsible for movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives the muscle something to pull on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives kind of that lever system for
muscles to pull on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it acts as mineral storage,
which is a way the body can kind of store
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals, especially calcium and
phosphorus, to be used to help radiate
[SPEAKER_00]: other levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, calcium, there's very little
of it in the blood, but it's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: crucial amount in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will actually take it from the bones if
it needs to, to help maintain that very
[SPEAKER_00]: precise level.
[SPEAKER_00]: In bone, the skeletal system is important
for blood cell formation, because within
[SPEAKER_00]: the bone marrow, as we'll see,
is responsible for many of the components
[SPEAKER_00]: of the circulatory system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about that cartilage,
bones in the cartilage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's different types of cartilage,
so that's important to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hyaline, there's fibrocartilage,
and there's elastic cartilage,
[SPEAKER_00]: located in different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hyaline cartilage is for smooth
surface and gliding of particular joints,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you can see kind of in your ball and
socket joint, in your elbow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have elastic cartilage,
which is very flexible and makes up the
[SPEAKER_00]: exterior of the ear and also your
epiglottis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your fibrocartilage is resisting strong
forces, very fibrous compression and
[SPEAKER_00]: tension that would be very important to
have in your vertebrae, between your
[SPEAKER_00]: vertebrae of your spinal cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different classifications of
bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's flat bones, irregular,
short bones, long bones, and sesamide
[SPEAKER_00]: bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just helpful classifications,
and a lot of them make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flat bones are flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irregulars are kind of those odd kind of
shaped short bones, long bones,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the sesamide bones here are kind of
like your specialty bones, as we see in
[SPEAKER_00]: the patella or kneecap.
[SPEAKER_00]: The composition of bone in general,
we have an organic component, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: your osteoblasts, which is your
bone-forming cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your osteocytes, which are mature bone
cells that maintain mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations, and then your osteoclasts,
which are large cells that reabsorb or
[SPEAKER_00]: break down the bone matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while these all kind of all start with
osteo, blasts are bone-forming,
[SPEAKER_00]: sites are the mature bone cells,
and clasts are the large cells that
[SPEAKER_00]: reabsorb or break down the bone matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these four types of cells are found
within the bone tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see kind of they're all organized
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cells, osteogenic cells,
are undifferentiated and develop into
[SPEAKER_00]: osteoblasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of have this kind of formation of
these different cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when osteoblasts get trapped
within the calcified matrix, their
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and function changes and become
osteocytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these have the unique ability
to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, our osteoclasts develop from
monocytes and acrophages and differ in
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance from other bone cells if you
were to look at them under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have our inorganic or mineral
components to the bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 67% bone by mass as minerals,
mainly calcium and phosphates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while a bone is composed of 39%
calcium, if you take all the bones in your
[SPEAKER_00]: body, it is 99% of the body's calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 1% is in the blood and that's a very
important 1% to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minerals are responsible for the bone
hardiness and resistance to compression.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can again just see the comparison
of what a bone is made out of and what
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage it makes up of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium and phosphate being key ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: While a bone is 17% phosphate,
it's again 99% of your total phosphate in
[SPEAKER_00]: your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gross anatomy of bones are bone
textures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adult skeleton has 206 bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a compact bone, which is the dense
outer layer, which gives it a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: really good strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then inside there's a honeycomb,
which is a spongy bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is to help reduce weight and
allow areas to be filled with bone marrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could be red or yellow depending on
your age.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's tough compact bone on the
outside really gives bones a lot of their
[SPEAKER_00]: total strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marrow produces necessary components of
the circulatory system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that marrow, particularly of the long
bones, we see kind of a superimposed image
[SPEAKER_00]: here, is making your red blood cells,
your white blood cells, and also your
[SPEAKER_00]: platelets.
[SPEAKER_00]: All very important for a fully functional
circulatory system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red bone marrow is a soft, spongy tissue
at the center of bones that produces red
[SPEAKER_00]: blood cells, white blood cells,
and also those all important platelets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since production of red blood cells
requires iron, the marrow is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: places in the body that normally stores a
supply of iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of gives you a real world image
of what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also contains stem cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stem cells are cells that can kind of
be made into anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at specifically cells
that will go along the path to help or aid
[SPEAKER_00]: in the circulatory system in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see the outer surface of the bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the red bone marrow and we have
the yellow bone marrow in the center here
[SPEAKER_00]: in this particular image.
[SPEAKER_00]: That yellow bone marrow that I mentioned,
it's an important component and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: increase with age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it contains, yellow bone marrow
contains mostly fat and begins to replace
[SPEAKER_00]: red bone marrow in long bones after about
five years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're younger, our bones contain very
little fat and as we age, the percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: of fat in the marrow increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an infant less than one year old,
composed mostly of that red bone marrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then childhood, one to 10 years old,
we see that yellow is starting to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adolescence, 10 to 20 years old,
much more yellow bones, kind of a yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: marrow within the bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're an adult, considered to be 25
years old, plus in this case, you see the
[SPEAKER_00]: vast majority has been replaced with
yellow bone marrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have that vital red bone marrow
to help keep producing some of those vital
[SPEAKER_00]: components of the cell, but you could see
not nearly as great percentage as it was
[SPEAKER_00]: when you were an infant.
