[SPEAKER_00]: Do you ever wonder what conditions you
should keep your mother or stock cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here we're going to go over the
details on how to maximize the conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: for your mother or stock plant here on
Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into the ideal
conditions for your mother or stock
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the goals keep the material
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is paramount.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not necessarily looking for yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, the goal is to produce plant
biomass in a form of active shoot tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at cloning that mother
or stock plant and keeping them healthy is
[SPEAKER_00]: very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: A growing plant is good, but the real goal
of a stock plant is to be a source of more
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, we do some things slightly
different than we would in the vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: growing phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while the vegetative environment in
general is a good representation of what
[SPEAKER_00]: you should have for a stock or mother
plant, going to make some slight tweaks to
[SPEAKER_00]: those general recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do those slight adjustments look
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've provided them here in an
organized list.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, we want approximately an 18
hour photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure we're keeping that
plant in the vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature for day and night should
be maintained was around that 70 or 20
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Celsius and keeping that
relatively warm conditions, but not
[SPEAKER_00]: excessively hot conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relative humidity around that 63% is
advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: To help keep the chance for disease down
and help reduce water stress on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're growing that mother or
stock plant, it's carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: enrichment can be at a concentration level
of about 650 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers will look at that and
say, well, why even add carbon dioxide at
[SPEAKER_00]: all?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't necessarily have to,
or why don't you bump that up to like a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand or 1,100 parts per million?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, keep in mind, we're looking at
growing the plant, but we're not looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at necessarily speed growing the plant per
se.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could always increase that to help
increase biomass and yield a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, our goal here is really to
produce more actively growing shoot tips
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce more asexual vegetative
propagation points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother plants typically grow in five to 10
plus gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some in very large containers
and that depends on the growers area or
[SPEAKER_00]: the age that they want to keep that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stock plants of about 10 months old should
have between 20 and 25 nodes on their main
[SPEAKER_00]: stem, just to give you kind of a general
kind of target there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a 10 month old plant,
approximately how big it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, you might want to look at your
conditions to see if they match these and
[SPEAKER_00]: see if you want to make any adjustments to
those conditions to keep the mother and
[SPEAKER_00]: stock plant in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only do you have a healthy plant,
a plant that will produce many clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this can help improve the efficiency
of your operation overall.
Thank you.
