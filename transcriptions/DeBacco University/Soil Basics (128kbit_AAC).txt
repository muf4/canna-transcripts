[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over some
basics of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while initially you may think this is
an area where kind of worms live,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep in mind that there is inorganic
mineral matter that composes 75%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, 5% organic matter which
contains microorganisms and
[SPEAKER_00]: macro-organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 50% of it is actually defined as
air and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what makes up soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, what is soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's mineral-based material that
also contains air, water, and organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times people, I think,
get hung up on the organic matter Keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind air and water are also vital
components there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good for growing plant conditions,
25% air, 25% water, 50% solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compacted soil, this is where we're kind
of squeezing out some of that air,
[SPEAKER_00]: still retaining 25% water, but increasing
that solid percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poorly drained soils, we also have that 5%
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've increased that water amount quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while the solid is still 50% here that
matches the good growing conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case we have an excessive amount
of water, suffocating those roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing plant performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particle size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the size of particles determines the
classification to the impact on open space
[SPEAKER_00]: between those particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most soils are a mixture of different
particle sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clay is defined as less than 0.002
millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the smallest of the particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gravel is the largest, 2 mils to about 75
millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sand and silt and clay are going to be the
three we're going to kind of focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silt is that 0.002, so from basically clay
up to 0.05 millimeters and sand would be
[SPEAKER_00]: larger, that 0.05 to about that 2
millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see just in comparison,
while we may think of sand particles being
[SPEAKER_00]: very small, it is clay that is actually
the smallest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, how do those look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have clay soils, we have sandy
soils, we have loamy soils here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clay being comprised of those smallest
particles and then loam kind of being in
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle and sand being the largest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, clay soils contain the smallest
particles and they have a tendency to pack
[SPEAKER_00]: together, reducing air spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greatest amount of surface area and they
have a great impact on soil properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: This soil will crack when dry and tends to
stick to equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've ever worked with clay in
like a pottery class, it has a very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar consistency in extreme cases to
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kind of see here where we're having
that stickiness appearance here,
[SPEAKER_00]: that sheeting that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be very indicative of a clay or
very, very small particle-based soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: A field test to determine clay,
simply take a sample of the soil in your
[SPEAKER_00]: hand, add a little water, and try to form
a ball, as we see here, and attempt to
[SPEAKER_00]: squeeze the ball into a flat ribbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the ribbon reaches about two inches
long or more before breaking, this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: sign you have clay soil because those
small particles are able to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of one quick way,
and not a 100% accurate way, but a quick
[SPEAKER_00]: way to give you an idea of does that soil
contain a lot of clay-based particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sandy soils, there's a largest of the soil
particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy to cultivate in sand,
however, they tend to dry out quickly and
[SPEAKER_00]: can be easily flushed of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while they can support plants because
of their large particle size, typically
[SPEAKER_00]: water can drain through them and soak in
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I typically don't see a lot
of plants being grown in desert regions
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's all sand, simply because of the
low rainfall and the tendency for the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: to dry out anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loamy soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The combination of particles about equal
parts, which is about 40% of sand,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40% of silt, offers many properties that
supports plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can hold nutrients, which is great,
while still allowing water to percolate
[SPEAKER_00]: through and air to infiltrate,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's a large range of loamy
soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of see three different subsurface
areas of loam here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dark brown is the fine kind of sandy
loam, subsurface layer is kind of this
[SPEAKER_00]: pale brown is like this kind of also along
those sandy-ish loam lines, and the red
[SPEAKER_00]: clay is a red clay loam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of see some variability
that does occur, but in general loamy
[SPEAKER_00]: soils do favor crop development.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil triangle, so it's important to be
able to read this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just on an initial kind of overview take,
you can see that clay is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: influence, but you'll notice there's of
course three sides of this triangle,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how we'd go about reading that is if
we had a soil that had 30% clay and 30%
[SPEAKER_00]: sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take that 30% line over here,
see where intersects our 30% line right
[SPEAKER_00]: here, so 30 and 30 here, and 30 and 30
would be 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40% would have to be silt.
[SPEAKER_00]: See this line that comes down here?
[SPEAKER_00]: All three intersect right at this point
here, indicating that soil would be a clay
[SPEAKER_00]: loam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you would take your three
percentages of clay, silt, and sand,
[SPEAKER_00]: and wherever those intersect would give
you the soil type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice that clay again,
because it's small particles, high surface
[SPEAKER_00]: area, has a great influence on the type of
soil it may be classified as.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sand, very difficult to be considered a
fully sand soil, and you can see those
[SPEAKER_00]: loamy soils are kind of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a true loam, a clay loam,
sandy loam, sandy clay loam, all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different forms of classification,
but you can see how you can kind of read
[SPEAKER_00]: this soil triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, you don't want to use soil if
you're growing in containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to just go out and dig a
bunch of soil, put it in containers and go
[SPEAKER_00]: grow in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often heavy and mineral based,
which can lead to issues utilized in
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water holding properties are not
conducive to container growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor soil is great for outdoor
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because plants may grow good outdoors
doesn't mean that will translate into the
[SPEAKER_00]: high stress environment of indoor
container gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
