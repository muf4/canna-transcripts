[SPEAKER_00]: So physiological disorders in tomatoes,
what causes them?
[SPEAKER_00]: The main cause is both extremes,
extreme cold or extreme heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at extreme cold,
we're looking at frost damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be blackened splotches on the
leaves, most evident in the upper leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent will protect your plants in
some way with some sort of cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or really how to control it, just add
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or be mindful if you're putting them on
early planting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put all your tomatoes out so you
don't lose the entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf burns, the other one, it's a browning
of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here, often confused with disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful when you make applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be evidence of spray damage
with high sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to shade your young seedlings
when they first go out into the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how to control it, well nothing can be
done once the leaves burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very quick rundown of the
extremes that cause physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: disorders in tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
