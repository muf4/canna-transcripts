[SPEAKER_01]: There are many options when it comes to
cover crops and supporting plants growing
[SPEAKER_01]: in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: On this Tobacco University video,
we're going to go out and see how the CBG
[SPEAKER_01]: gurus do both their cover cropping method
as well as their plant support.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so a lot of options out there,
but let's take a look and see one example
[SPEAKER_01]: here, how a hemp grower in southern New
England handles this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first off, who are these CBG gurus?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they are built around the belief of
producing a premium quality craft hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: product with the manufacture of stability
alignment and alignment with nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use wood chips basically on the
ground there to really help improve soil
[SPEAKER_01]: quality and structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also implement many of the Korean
natural farming methods as well in
[SPEAKER_01]: combination with modern science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sean and Jacob have been great to kind of
work with and allow me into their field to
[SPEAKER_01]: give you their contact information as well
as their website to take a look at,
[SPEAKER_01]: which will also be in the description.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to kind of the CBG gurus who
they are, some things we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: discuss in this particular video is going
to be the cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while different areas can have
different cover crop, ideal cover crops to
[SPEAKER_01]: utilize, this is a great resource there to
give you many different options.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see a couple mentioned today,
but this is a great resource also to take
[SPEAKER_01]: a look at there if you're interested in
cover cropping fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, this plant support system that
they utilize, they use trellis netting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They simply take trellis netting and mount
it horizontally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of use a modified screen of green
method with the key to basically make this
[SPEAKER_01]: system work is really the heavy duty metal
stakes that they use on the ends and
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the field to really give that
some support there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully you find this information
useful and interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we go out to the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we see here is a very unique cover
cropping system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now only do we have mulch here,
wood chips essentially to protect the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground from moisture loss in weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also see integrated cover crops as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have a diversified group of cover
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got oats here, which,
you know, we're getting into late July,
[SPEAKER_01]: early August, and you know, they're kind
of going by the wayside and they're being
[SPEAKER_01]: cut down with a weed whacker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also have daikon radishes, as we can see
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something else unique, cause it's kind
of an inter planting, we're noticing sweet
[SPEAKER_01]: potatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're nice, low growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not really competing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can clearly see the canvas plants
growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've got our nice cover crop
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's giving our soil diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's giving a great way to kind of get
something established, give something back
[SPEAKER_01]: to the soil and very easy to manage from
the grower standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So both of those features make it really
nice to have this kind of system working
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we see the row, it's just been
weed whacked and we can kind of see that
[SPEAKER_01]: wood chip mulch there at the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also see what an easy knockdown it
is for those selected cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here's a daikon radish a little late
here in the summer, but we can see one
[SPEAKER_01]: actively growing right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also see remnants of past crops as
well, daikon radishes, as well as some old
[SPEAKER_01]: potatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of this is giving this area diversity
and we're not really tilling the soil here
[SPEAKER_01]: in this example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's giving everything kind of a set
in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those oats will go down really nice,
obliterate really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see we're left with this nice
walking path.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also going to suppress soil splash.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see drip irrigation if needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also see the netting here and
that's allowing us to kind of have this
[SPEAKER_01]: support for the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Metal stakes are strongly advised because
they are so strong against the winds and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing a couple layer system as we see with
some of the mother plants allows us to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of hold those plants in place,
hold those in their respective areas and
[SPEAKER_01]: then not worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if we do get a wind event when the
plants are below this netting,
[SPEAKER_01]: well they're usually too small to be too
harmed by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is only about two and a half feet up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once they get to that and start working
their way through, that's when they need
[SPEAKER_00]: the support and that's when they will get
it with the first layer of the screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's good enough to do once.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good enough to do many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that nice replication here of
the rows of this nice screening,
[SPEAKER_01]: nice trellis netting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty taut so that's going to hold
it very level.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to allow us to allow those
plants to grow up it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see here second tier are ready to
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants just coming through that first
tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great way to be very efficient
with your time and really to focus on one
[SPEAKER_01]: row.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now to help the growers, also planting the
same variety in each can allow you to
[SPEAKER_01]: manage those well within each row in
different rows, different varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different care that they may need but
keeping the same variety in the row or at
[SPEAKER_01]: least most of the row will really help you
go through and be able to be efficient
[SPEAKER_01]: with what you're setting up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Metal stakes again very much advised.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have taller plants, shorter plants,
older plants, seeing a nice little mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping good records so we know kind of
what works and then hopefully repeat what
[SPEAKER_01]: works next year on a larger scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here we're able to see our mother
plants and we're seeing our three tier
[SPEAKER_01]: system of these screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have space pretty evenly to give those
plants support.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have metal stakes here to really
provide the entire structure support
[SPEAKER_01]: because it is on the end here in case
there's a wind event.
[SPEAKER_01]: See those plants grow right up through it
very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a couple just starting to poke
through the second layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already have the third layer in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why you want that third layer
in place is you don't want to have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: worrying about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set it all up once.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know the plants are going to get
big, set it all up at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have to worry about it and you
can spend more time training those plants
[SPEAKER_01]: up through it.
Thank you.
