[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to investigate some
of the pros and cons to cloning cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting off with cloning cannabis,
this is a vegetative propagation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones are genetically identical to their
parent or mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also sometimes called the stock
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps ensure consistency and gender
of the offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the clone army in Star Wars,
we're generating identical copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the benefits of cloning, the goals
produce many identical copies of a chosen
[SPEAKER_00]: individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: This preserves the chosen or desirable
traits, unlike seeds that produce a high
[SPEAKER_00]: degree of variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: This ensures only female plants are
produced, so we won't be wasting our time
[SPEAKER_00]: with the males, so that we're only getting
the buds in cannabinoid production that's
[SPEAKER_00]: very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, this is a very efficient
production method, not only in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: of the end product, but also the process
to generate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It limits the needs to sex plants,
because you're guaranteed that they'll all
[SPEAKER_00]: be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as you're starting with a
female plant, then they can be planted as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as the roots develop, there's not a
lot of lag time in that seedling stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time to harvest can be reduced when
compared with initial seedling delay when
[SPEAKER_00]: starting with seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not only improving your time
efficiency, but you're kind of making this
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice repeatable process there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drawbacks that for all clones have or
lack resistance to disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's possible to lose an entire crop
due to the lack of variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give the example here of bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cavendish bananas that we're all
familiar with eating are very susceptible
[SPEAKER_00]: to a Fusarium disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, since they're all clones,
bananas are actually clones of one
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the disease figures one out,
it's able to kind of spread in this
[SPEAKER_00]: domino-like effect and wipe out
potentially an entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that here where this plant's
resistant, this plant's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we were cloning this plant,
all of the offspring would also not be
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to the particular disease,
and as a result, we could lose them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cloning for sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, since we've gone into cloning for
whether you have a male or a female plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: what this does, this involves taking a
clone early from a plant and placing it in
[SPEAKER_00]: that 12 hours of light and 12 hours of
dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will induce flowering very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help you determine if it's a
male or female earlier in development.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can allow you to make an educated
decision whether you're going to keep or
[SPEAKER_00]: discard that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key is to label each plant that you
take these cuttings from and where the
[SPEAKER_00]: cuttings are going for accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, PCR, polymerous chain reaction,
has made this obsolete for large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this can be an expensive process
that some, as a way to reduce costs,
[SPEAKER_00]: are just simply taking a small clone from
a plant that they grew from seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: flipping it to 12 hours a day,
12 hours a night, to see what types of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers it produces, and then deciding
whether or not they're going to keep or
[SPEAKER_00]: discard that individual.
Thank you.
