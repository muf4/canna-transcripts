[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be focused on the gas
exchange that occurs in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while there's a bunch of other things
going on here, we're specifically looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the carbon dioxide and the oxygen in
this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Realize that those are used as part of
different reactions that are going on
[SPEAKER_00]: within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's water and there's all these other
kind of molecules that are being either
[SPEAKER_00]: produced or consumed, but here we're
focusing simply on the exchange of carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide and oxygen in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants need to breathe just like we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, unlike us, plants need to consume
carbon dioxide and they exhale oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking in carbon dioxide from the
air and they're releasing oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, through our breathing, we do the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're consuming oxygen and producing
carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the importance of the carbon cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look up here, seeing a little
bit of our kind of carbon dioxide within a
[SPEAKER_00]: forest system, but the same is true for
all plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carbon dioxide abbreviated CO2 is
taken in from the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the clear here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the carbon dioxide taken from the
air and is assembled into sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through the process of photosynthesis,
which you see occurring here, we're taking
[SPEAKER_00]: in the sun's light energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burning of plants, see down here,
we see a couple of reds pop up here and
[SPEAKER_00]: here, will release carbon dioxide back
into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the yellow here is the sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red appears here, here, and here is
fire or respiration that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the carbon dioxide molecules,
the clear ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green is just carbon, which is stored in
the trunk of trees or plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And blue is water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, those are all coming together right
here for this photosynthetic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now plants regulate carbon dioxide and
water via the stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stomata are pores, they're not holes,
in leaves that allow the plant to take in
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: These might say they're pores,
they're not holes, as they're able to be
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this one opening and closing
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what they look like on the leaf
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look straight, if you kind of scan
that leaf surface with a microscope,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what you may see.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a greater concentration on the
undersides of leaves in most plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: except not in lily pads because of the
water there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically on the underside of the leaf,
it's where you'll find the stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important because when we're
foliar spraying our plants and looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: get nutrients and other products inside
the leaf, the stomata is one way where we
[SPEAKER_00]: can kind of easily get something into the
interior portions of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants also regulate carbon dioxide and
water via these stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when the stomata are open,
they let CO2 in, which is great,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at the same time, they're also losing
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're in a continual balance here of
taking in carbon dioxide and losing that
[SPEAKER_00]: precious water they absorbed through the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are in this battle of trying to
regulate stomata to take in carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: so they can produce the sugars that they
need, but not lose too much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I have the seesaw here to
kind of show that balance of taking in one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, but losing another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly here, the roots of the plant,
we can't forget those in gas exchange,
[SPEAKER_00]: they respire just like us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, they're consuming oxygen
and releasing carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important that roots have oxygen
present along with sufficient water and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it is possible to drown plants
and by adding too much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we just talked about, these roots
taking in oxygen and also sugars,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will be releasing carbon dioxide and
water, and the stomata in the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to take in carbon dioxide from the
air through the process of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keeping in mind, we have to look at
what the leaves are doing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: chloroplast and also what the roots are
doing, because they're kind of both
[SPEAKER_00]: complete, this continual cycle here of gas
exchange in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for joining us.
