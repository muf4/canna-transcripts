[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this video on the basic body
orientation terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this might seem pretty simplistic,
it is important to be able to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these terms and vocabulary because
if you're generating a report or reading
[SPEAKER_00]: an autopsy these are the terms that are
going to be used so it's important that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have an understanding of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these anatomical positions are used to
describe regions of the body in common
[SPEAKER_00]: terms and vocabulary and this is how
scientists can communicate easily with one
[SPEAKER_00]: another so that everyone has the same
mental image and everyone's on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at some of the key terms
you should be familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well one is the superior and the inferior.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the example here, the superior is
towards the head and the inferior is
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind when we're looking at
describing something or where something
[SPEAKER_00]: might be progressing to we're looking at
kind of towards the head or towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: feet we'd use the terms superior or
inferior here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have terms called dorsal and
ventral and dorsal is towards the back and
[SPEAKER_00]: ventral is towards the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have the picture of the fish here
because a lot of times we think of the
[SPEAKER_00]: dorsal fin which is on the top here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the back of the fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ventral side to the underside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relating this to humans, that dorsal
cavity would be kind of where the backbone
[SPEAKER_00]: vertebrae are and the ventral cavity is
more towards the front here where the
[SPEAKER_00]: chest and stomach are located.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind of that dorsal and ventral
no matter what the orientation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: organism is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting to proximal and distal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proximal is towards the point of
attachment and distal away from the point
[SPEAKER_00]: of attachment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking kind of the arm the
proximal area is closer towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: shoulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: The distal region is getting out towards
the hand there away from the point of
[SPEAKER_00]: attachment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again this might be important in
particular of limbs looking at lacerations
[SPEAKER_00]: and describing them as far as where they
might be located or they might be
[SPEAKER_00]: traveling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have potentially discovering a
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be on the supine or the prone
position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supine is laying on the back side which we
can see evident as this person is and then
[SPEAKER_00]: prone would be laying on the belly side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So describing how a potential victim was
found at a crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: These terms will often be used if the
victim is lying horizontally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have anterior and posterior and
anterior is the front side and posterior
[SPEAKER_00]: is the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that evident here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again keeping in mind some of these
orientation positions will help aid in a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly we have something called
medial and then we have a lateral.
[SPEAKER_00]: So medial is closer to the midline of the
body and lateral be away from the midline
[SPEAKER_00]: of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that described or shown right
here along with some of the other terms
[SPEAKER_00]: that we covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again some of this is just that
memorization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But knowing these terms will not only
allow you to produce a quality report but
[SPEAKER_00]: read one that might be generated from
somebody else.
