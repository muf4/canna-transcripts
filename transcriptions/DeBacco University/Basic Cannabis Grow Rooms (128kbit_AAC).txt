[SPEAKER_00]: So when producing cannabis, to be
efficient, grow rooms may be divided into
[SPEAKER_00]: different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some basic rooms would be a clone room,
a mother room, a vegetative room,
[SPEAKER_00]: a flower room, and a dry and cure room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's just some of the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go over just an overview of
what each of these rooms may entail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting common to all of these rooms
should be cleanliness, good air
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation, and monitoring systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way to control different aspects and
environments within the room and ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: check to make sure everything's working
and functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The check protocols is a great way to
hopefully notice that something's going
[SPEAKER_00]: awry very early so it doesn't damage the
crop permanently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rooms may not always be physically
separate, so some operations, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: typically the smaller ones, will have dual
purpose rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can reduce the efficiencies and
possibly cause contamination and spread of
[SPEAKER_00]: disease quicker when you have these dual
functional rooms, and that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: cleanliness is even more important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Older plants with the younger plants begin
as older plants may be sick or can carry
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases, potential insects, and it could
infect the younger plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also lighting intensities may need to be
adjusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Older plants may not be getting enough
light, while younger plants could be
[SPEAKER_00]: getting too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of really that one room kind
of fits all and does everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why typically there's sections put
into rooms and partitions to allow them
[SPEAKER_00]: each to be treated slightly differently to
maximize production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clone room, so this is also referred
to as a propagation room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds can be started or clones can be
rooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically this room will have higher
humidity than the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, there's less intense light
required if you don't want to burn the
[SPEAKER_00]: timber foliage, and this needs frequent
monitoring, especially if you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at clone operations, to make sure pH is
kept well, make sure you're getting roots
[SPEAKER_00]: out of your clones here, make sure your
seedlings are started because we're kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of starting those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very critical part of the entire
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is often one that can be a little
smaller because the plants of course are
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller, but needs to have very careful
monitoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at the mother or
stock plant room, and this is where the
[SPEAKER_00]: mother or stock plants are kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically fewer but larger plants,
and we want these plants to remain in the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative state, so keep in mind it's
giving them 16 plus hours of continuous
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers may even choose to run 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is often where rare and unique
genetics may be kept, so monitoring this
[SPEAKER_00]: area is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Security is also a high priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unique individuals, you have the picture
of the albino here, is found.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goal is to clone that plant to
produce many of those desired copies of
[SPEAKER_00]: that offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, I have this picture here
because growers may want to choose to
[SPEAKER_00]: prune them a little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to increase the branching to
increase the availability of clones that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be used for propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the vegetative room, this is where
plants are focused on growing leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not looking at flowers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping that 16 plus hours of continuous
light is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, if you cut that down below
that, you run the risk of your entire room
[SPEAKER_00]: going into flower prematurely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers again run even this area in
24 hours of light, but this often leads to
[SPEAKER_00]: wasted light and diminishing returns on
investment because of the increased cost
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with running those lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the plants well fed, as this is a
very important stage for development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure those plants are not stressed at
all and able to produce as many leaves as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you can see this kind of purple hue
to these leaves, and that's because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's an LED light with that purple
heavy purple spectrum running in this area
[SPEAKER_00]: of the vegetative room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flower room, I hear the photo here
should be adjusted to 12 hours of light
[SPEAKER_00]: and 12 hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this is commonly referred to as the
money room, setting up your plants well in
[SPEAKER_00]: the vegetative room is important for their
success during this stressful flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know these have kind of that yellow look
to them because they're running high
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure sodium lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is again often referred to as the
money room, even though really setting
[SPEAKER_00]: this plants up in the vegetative room is
very important to allow them to perform
[SPEAKER_00]: well when they go into the flowering room
or the flowering stage of development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the drying cure room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the last stage of the process and
controlled and consistent conditions are
[SPEAKER_00]: very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to lose your harvest this
late in the season, this late in the game
[SPEAKER_00]: as you have the maximum amount of
investment in your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping the lights as minimum as possible
and control over humidity are very
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have mold that increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be sure that you're able to
dry them efficiently and effectively so
[SPEAKER_00]: you get the maximum return on your
investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
