[SPEAKER_00]: In this tobacco university video,
we're going to look at fascination with
[SPEAKER_00]: fascination on a cannabis mother and clone
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to hear from Connor out from
the greenhouse to show us one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that is going through and cloning,
as you can see in the picture here,
[SPEAKER_00]: to see if we can perpetuate this
fascination trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, I should define this in
fascination.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not aware, it is really defined
as development of elongated, flattened,
[SPEAKER_00]: and stems on a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can clearly see that here compared to
the normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be also expressed in the flowers
from the apical part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see this one in comparison to the
normal one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dandelions can also have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see the normal dandelions in the
background with this fascination one here
[SPEAKER_00]: in the foreground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is this good or bad, particularly
related to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, typically it's not considered to be
advantageous other than a unique
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in cannabis, this change in
flower morphology can lead to some
[SPEAKER_00]: interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see all these plants exhibit
fascination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the question is, is this good or is
this bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely is looking very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some potential causes for
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: To get it kind of like the root causes,
what this might occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is typically the result of a
genetic mutation of the meristematic
[SPEAKER_00]: region of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, meristematic region is the area
of high cell division.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is evident by the elongated and
flattened cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of what the top of the plant
looks like right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As seen in the example here, it's the
apical meristem showing the change in this
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really not shown on the side
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see that in a moment with
Connor out in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since this occurrence is typically
isolated, it could be pruned out if the
[SPEAKER_00]: grower decided.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, the grower has attempted
to clean and clone it for the future to
[SPEAKER_00]: see if this trait will continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, does fascination equal a super bud?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're seeing this change in
morphology in that apical meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, is that going to make a super bud?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, typically the apical bud,
the top bud can initially look very
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive, but often the actual
development is quite poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it may look like it might be a
super dense bud, sometimes there is a lack
[SPEAKER_00]: of density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to the rarity, there is the reason for
the cloning is to simply increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: sample size to see if this is,
if this initial observation repeats
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, even if a good structured super
bud was to develop, you have to keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind that the odds of botrytis would
likely be much greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: So extra attention would have to be taken
for this plant to ensure you're not losing
[SPEAKER_00]: this unique quality to a botrytis or a bud
rot mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go out to Connor and see what he
has to show us with the fascination plant
[SPEAKER_00]: we've seen in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, we are back here in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here looking at our fascinated
plants again, our mutations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we have one of our original
fascinated plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it started down way down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It started getting wide, started thinning
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you follow along up, you can see it
only keeps getting wider.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's around two and a half inches,
almost getting to three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually up here started to curl in
on itself, almost like a piece of celery.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a crease that goes down the middle
and that eventually follows all the way up
[SPEAKER_01]: to this new apical meristem growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this plant specifically has some of
the most unique growth because there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: fascination on any of the side branches
coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the difference between the
thickness of that main stem and this
[SPEAKER_01]: branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absurd.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once again, if you look up to the top,
near the apical meristem, you can see how
[SPEAKER_01]: bushy it's really getting compared to a
normal standard growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little nervous as it as it starts to
bud that we might be running into some
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity, moisture issues with this large
mass of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to watch it carefully and
make sure to thin out any leaves that I
[SPEAKER_01]: need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is just a beautiful work of nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want a little comparison for
size, that is, of course, a quarter
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting in the middle of the stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just looks crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I look forward to what this plant
comes to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping for a really unique kind of
wide flower, nice big bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once again, I do have to worry about
those moisture issues as it does bush up
[SPEAKER_01]: some more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here looking at our faciated plants
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: These mutations along the stem were so
unique that I decided that I wanted to try
[SPEAKER_01]: to continue on the legacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we have two clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are a Bayox strain, a high CBD
variety, and they were taken from this
[SPEAKER_01]: faciated branch right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at these clones,
they have continued to faciate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have these long, wide stems that are
really strong and dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see how thick it really is when you
get those angles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both clones are exhibiting this feature.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one almost already like a half an
inch wide, when in reality it should only
[SPEAKER_01]: be millimeters thick at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really trying to keep these going
and possibly get a whole bay of faciated
[SPEAKER_01]: plants if possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love this mutation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't wait to see what it does once
it fully flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see you next time.
