[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tobacco University video,
we're going to be exploring CBD-based hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, giving you a little bit of
background of the summary of the story of
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlotte's Web, as Charlotte here is
thought to be one of the great
[SPEAKER_00]: contributors to science to be able to
really help support and really start a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole wave looking really at CBD for
potential medical treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, well, who is Charlotte Figge
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see her pictured here.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a child with castrophic type of
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She became a symbol of positive impacts
that CBD can have on individuals,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly young children in this
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlotte had Dravet syndrome,
which is a rare form of epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, she did pass away in April 7th in
the year 2020 at only the age of 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her cause of death was thought to be
pneumonia, but in that short life that she
[SPEAKER_00]: did have, she did have a great
contribution here to the cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she had that rare form of epilepsy,
which is basically that Dravet syndrome,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a kind of seizures that start
very early on during the first year of
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of showing brainwave patterns
of a seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlotte at the age of six was having a
seizure about every 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only were they potentially very
severe, but they were reoccurring at a
[SPEAKER_00]: very short intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over two years, her parents,
Paige and Matt, had tried many different
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sought out a lot of advice and
medical kind of advice from different
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors, and they tried a whole bunch of
different things, diet alterations,
[SPEAKER_00]: acupuncture, drugs, with really no changes
from any of the above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really sadly at the peak, Charlotte was
having about 300 seizures a week or about
[SPEAKER_00]: two every hour, and at certain times was
not talking, not moving, and then doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: really were looking at some very
experimental-type options.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, half a world away, Matt,
the father, was deployed to Afghanistan,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he was researching online,
and he found evidence that cannabis may
[SPEAKER_00]: help reduce seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of just odd that he was in
Afghanistan in a lot of areas where
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially cannabis or certain forms of
cannabis may have originated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a kind of connection there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thank him for his service as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this leads us to these Stanley
brothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are they involved?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the Stanley brothers were marijuana
growers in Colorado, and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: cross-breeding a strain of marijuana
that's high in CBD and low in THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, THC is that psychoactive
ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their focus was to breed down the THC and
breed up in concentration the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were able to achieve a CBD level of
about 21% while still maintaining a THC
[SPEAKER_00]: level under 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a very stark difference between
those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason was not for recreational
smoking, which is typically associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with THC, but for the potential for
medical benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Stanley brothers were really
seeking the highest grade of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, and here, looking at the
CBD, breeding that up in concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: while reducing the THC levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at this kind of flower
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mother went to a local Denver,
Colorado dispensary and purchased some
[SPEAKER_00]: high CBD variety cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The owner were actually surprised of the
request since nobody really wanted it
[SPEAKER_00]: because it didn't have really any effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That high CBD level doesn't really have
that psychoactive high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That low THC and high CBD really lacks
that recreational kind of psychoactive
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thought to be potentially what was called
R4 at the time had a CBD level of 17.61%
[SPEAKER_00]: and a THC level under 1% of only 0.76%.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it is important to note that even
0.76% by the current 2018 farm bill would
[SPEAKER_00]: still be considered federally illegal or
marijuana at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mother, after taking the flower
home, extracted the CBD from that flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of extracted that particular
compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the impact of the actual treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day that she was given, that Charlotte
was given the CBD oil treatment under the
[SPEAKER_00]: tongue, she did not have a seizure that
day, which continued into the night and
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, there was a sharp decline in
seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very notable and again,
very positive here.
[SPEAKER_00]: She went from having 300 seizures a week
to only having one a week just from this
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: She went from being on a feeding tube,
this is Charlotte, to eating on her own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she started talking and also walking
on her own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this really cause an eye-opening
experience at large in the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: industry as well that CBD treatment may
really provide a lot of potential when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at seizures in this example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at does Charlotte's Web equal
CW2A?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was according to the US Patent and
Trademark Office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joel Stanley filed a patent application in
May 2018 on behalf of his company,
[SPEAKER_00]: also named Charlotte's Web.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the public documents, Stanley
describes a plant type capable of
[SPEAKER_00]: producing 6.24% CBD content and 0.27% CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.3% THC content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're looking at these numbers and
from what I just previously described,
[SPEAKER_00]: say it's much lower, but keep in mind
here, this is staying with or under that
[SPEAKER_00]: federal limit of 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, the CBD conservation was
reduced, but still having 6.24%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very high producing CBD strain here
and still staying with under that federal
[SPEAKER_00]: limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the patent was actually approved in
July of 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you search it on the internet,
you likely can probably find this patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new cultivar, CW2A, was asexually
reproduced via stem cuttings of vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: and or flowering plants and cloning by the
inventor and the inventor's greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: nurseries, fields, and our facilities in
Colorado Springs, Colorado, according to
[SPEAKER_00]: the patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Asexual clones from the original source
have been tested in greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: nurseries, fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: The properties of each clone from its
cultivar were found to be transmissible by
[SPEAKER_00]: such asexual reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cultivar is stable and reproduces true
to type in successful generations of
[SPEAKER_00]: asexual reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of just proves or shows here
that it wasn't just a one-off plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't just one unique individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is reproducible through asexual
reproduction, typically using vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation known as clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant patent specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the patent was issued by CW Holdings
as a plant patent, not a broader utility
[SPEAKER_00]: patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to be careful in the definition
between those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means it is good only for legal
protection against a competitor growing
[SPEAKER_00]: the same cultivar from a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though this may be overall limited
protection, it is groundbreaking,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is the first and only plant
patent for hemp cultivar issued within the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, again, shows you what the utility
patent covers, gives you kind of some
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptions here as far as looking at the
utility patent that's case-dependent and
[SPEAKER_00]: can include all of this phenotypes
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you that general overview
here with the plant patent specifics here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just keep in mind that this is not a
broader utility patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just looking for that kind of way of
protecting for a competitor growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: same clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The value of having this patent here,
what's the advantage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would it go through this process?
[SPEAKER_00]: The patent doesn't prevent others from
developing their own strain of similar
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an important note.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal from the breeder standpoint,
though, is to protect the strain you have
[SPEAKER_00]: put time into and resources to develop and
protect your specific strain here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patent does not prevent a competitor
competition in general, but can provide an
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's advantageous for them
to go through and have that patent for
[SPEAKER_00]: their plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The specifics of Charlotte's Web.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a sativa-based strain with a
state of 13% CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the patent does state officially
6.2%.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24% CBD and that THC below that 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: These unique proprietary genetics are used
by Charlotte's Web, the company,
[SPEAKER_00]: to create extracts for a variety of health
and wellness products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contrary to popular belief, Charlotte's
Web products are hemp-derived and are
[SPEAKER_00]: non-intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lack any strong levels of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: New consumers should consult their doctor
with any medical concerns, but this I felt
[SPEAKER_00]: important to kind of address this story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did get a national publication and
really gave cannabis really kind of ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: in the market to allow doctors to even
look at it further and really to
[SPEAKER_00]: investigate the CBD for its potential
medical benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Charlotte, again, sadly in her short
life there, was able really to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: radically change the cannabis industry and
people's perceptions of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has led to hopefully continuation
for it to be used and to help other
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
