[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, we're going to look at seed
plants or plants that produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave two representative samples
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean these are the only two.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, this would be the dandelion
and the pine tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the evolution of seed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed is a critical adaptation to life
on land because it protects the embryonic
[SPEAKER_00]: plant when it is at its most vulnerable
stage of its life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed plants produce two kinds of
gametophytes, male and female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which develop completely within the
sporophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male gametophyte is called the pollen
grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gives rise to the microspores.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female gametophyte contains the egg
within the ovule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this develops into the megaspore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a way to try to remember this is
you think it's like a sperm and an egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sperm is very small in comparison to
the egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sperm in this case represents the
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the male portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very small region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the egg or the ovule is the megaspore
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much larger in comparison in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So evolution of seed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All seed plants are derived from a single
common ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's two main branch points here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have gymnosperms and angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gymnosperms, the ovules are not
completely enclosed by the sporophyte
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue at the time of pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's evident by our pine cone here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microscopic female gametophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: N is inside the ovulate cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And microscopic male gametophyte N inside
the pollen cone here also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see if you've looked very carefully
at pine trees, yes they have the cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also produce these male microspores
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is containing the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Angiosperms, in the other case here,
are ones that produce flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They most recently evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ovules are completely enclosed in the
sporophyte tissue called the carpal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is at the time of pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're the ones producing the true
flowers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microscopic female gametophyte N inside
the parts of the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the microscopic male gametophyte
inside these flower parts here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is again the sporophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two N and the pollen is the N along
with the egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: The evolution of the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed has three visible parts to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endosperm is a source of food that
develops that the developing embryo needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some seeds the endosperm is used up by
the embryo and stored as food in
[SPEAKER_00]: structures called cotyledons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about monocots and
dicots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dicot meaning, di meaning two.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's basically two seed leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monocot meaning one seed leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: The embryo is the simple small little
plantlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just kind of what's going to
host the genetic information that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to develop into the full size plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the coat is a drought resistance
protective layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the outside here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the comparison between a bean
seed and a corn seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we'll have another video that
describes monocots and dicots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be able to further understand the
difference between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now just looking at the seeds
you see they have a lot of the same parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key difference here is the cotyledon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have cotyledon here pointing to two,
meaning dicots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two seed leaves in this bean seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cotyledon in the corn is only one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So benefits of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, seeds offer a lot of benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It benefits the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dispersal is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It facilitates the migration to new
habitats.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here by the wind carrying new seeds of
dandelion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This permits plants to delay the
development until conditions are
[SPEAKER_00]: favorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plant doesn't necessarily want to
germinate in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be able to tolerate the
harsh winter, particularly here in New
[SPEAKER_00]: England.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germination controls when the plant
develops so that it can be synchronized
[SPEAKER_00]: with critical aspects of the plant's
habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants may want to time the germination
and delay their dormancy so once most
[SPEAKER_00]: favorable for them to actually grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In nourishment, seeds provide nourishment
of the young plant during the critical
[SPEAKER_00]: period just after germination as we see
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So relating to dormancy and germination,
this young seedling here may want to wait
[SPEAKER_00]: until the spring when the larger trees and
shade that it might be around it aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: fully developed yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is getting some nutrients here to allow
it to fully expand its leaves before it
[SPEAKER_00]: starts making its own sugars from the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Improved seed dispersal is fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fruits are a great way plants have
developed to be able to disperse their
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A mature ovary surrounds the ovule,
becomes all or part of the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our angiosperms, again our flower
producing plants, they use fruits to
[SPEAKER_00]: induce animals to disperse the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although eaten by animals, the seeds
within the fruit are resistant to chewing
[SPEAKER_00]: and digestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pass out of the animal in the feces,
ready to germinate at a new location far
[SPEAKER_00]: from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why typically farmers may add
manure to their fields because it helps
[SPEAKER_00]: plants grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be a potential reason why that
occurs is plants are used to being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: pass through the digestive system and then
grow in fertile manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some fruits are dispersed by wind or
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here the coconut by water and our
dandelion again by wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just because a bird comes through and
picks up a berry here doesn't mean it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: bad thing for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being dispersed to different regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Us, watermelons, we take them to picnics
and the monkeys and the squirrels here,
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to disperse things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, seeds can kind of attach themselves,
in this case physically, to clothing or
[SPEAKER_00]: other animals through these burrs and be
dispersed that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these are ways that plants have
evolved to help increase their ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: disperse their seeds and take over and be
introduced to new locations.
Thank you.
