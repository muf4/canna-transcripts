[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we'll look at some of the
basics of nutrient management for squash,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it can be whether you're managing
organic nutrients or chemical fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to start with a soil test and to
amend our soil so that we are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: optimum conditions to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now nutrient deficiencies in squash,
we have nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What to look for is yellowing of older
leaves, stunted vine growth, and overall
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of limey green color.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to fertilize with a
nitrogen-based fertilizer, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: early in the season when the soil is cold
if you didn't have a chance to warm up
[SPEAKER_00]: quite yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continue regular but small doses of
nitrogen fertilizer until we get the kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of fruit set and you can back off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The picture I want to show you here that
I've taken of a field really shows
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen deficiencies and how they can
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the plants in the back here
are stunted in yellow compared to the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very small area, two,
three, four, five, only about six,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven plants long, and we can see that the
nitrogen shifts between here, here,
[SPEAKER_00]: here, particularly knowing the background
of this field personally, this was a
[SPEAKER_00]: wetter area and as a result this leached
out more of the nitrogen and this held
[SPEAKER_00]: more than nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be even in this small plot of an
area, you can have different requirements
[SPEAKER_00]: for nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just something to keep in mind there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium deficiencies, this is leaf
browning typically at the margins,
[SPEAKER_00]: which typically coincides with fruit set
or occurs shortly after fruits begins to
[SPEAKER_00]: swell.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent this well if you're known
to be low in this you can by adding,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can start adding some potassium,
what about the flowers start to open so
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't get into this deficiency
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: If caught early it can be corrected,
however if it's caught late yields may
[SPEAKER_00]: suffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: High potassium fertilizer like potassium
sulfate is recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that here that I spotted here
in this field, the margins are starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: burn, this was late in the season so not a
major issue but a sign that this field in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future is probably low in potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have the low end side, we also have
the high end side.
[SPEAKER_00]: High nitrogen improves plant growth but
can actually impact and reduce yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch foliar applications as large and
thin leaves of squash can burn very
[SPEAKER_00]: easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also get thin and crack,
they can get this really aged look.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a picture of me here with some
really tall leaves here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a typical gardener's glove with a
giant leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all in the case of excessive
nutrients which we want to avoid because
[SPEAKER_00]: not only are we wasting the time and the
money of applying them, also could be
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing to soil contaminants.
