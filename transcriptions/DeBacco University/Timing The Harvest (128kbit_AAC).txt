[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, with cannabis, you want to be
careful and time your harvest properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we see kind of in this image here with
all the birds and the cleverly placed
[SPEAKER_00]: glass that makes it look like they're
flying out, the timing of your harvest can
[SPEAKER_00]: be very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that timing, the goal is to hit the
peak of maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too early and the buds will be immature
and not have quite the cannabinoid content
[SPEAKER_00]: that you may want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And too late, the substances,
cannabinoids, terpenes will break down,
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing its desirability of your
particular end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your goal is to time it just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just at the perfect time to get
the maximum amount of yield, maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of terpenes, maximum amount of
cannabinoids in your particular bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now timing can help improve the harvest
because the aging and curing process is
[SPEAKER_00]: also important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to negate that to help
improve taste and fragrances while also
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, depending on the specific
compounds targeted, the harvest time may
[SPEAKER_00]: differ to ensure that you're maximizing
the harvest of your particular end
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for THC, production typically increases
at the very end of the plant's life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, high THC, elevated levels of THC
will classify something as marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at CBD or hemp in
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in regards to CBD production,
peak CBD production typically occurs
[SPEAKER_00]: before peak THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important for cultivators that are
playing a close line with the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: limit to know when one cannabinoid may
peak versus another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, here if you let it go too far,
THC may increase too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why that's important is the
classification of hemp to marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, it's possible for a cannabis
plant to be legal below 0.3% THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then later in the season could become
illegal, meaning it will test higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So testing is important to know your
cultivar that you're using as a grower and
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure you're playing that line as
hemp and not getting into the marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: classification with that elevated level of
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some varieties, for some
cultivars, that could potentially happen
[SPEAKER_00]: if you let it go too long because THC
production occurs later in the life cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: of a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids in general are found in
greatest concentrations in the flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: with some found in nearby leaves,
like for example here and here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this is where your greatest
concentration is going to be here and
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post-harvest cannabinoid content can begin
to slowly degrade with light and high
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: High temperatures defined as 80 degrees
Fahrenheit and above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, excessive handling and high humidity
conditions can speed up this degradation
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, these are conditions that you
want to keep your harvest away from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And determining the peak ripeness,
looking carefully at the resin production
[SPEAKER_00]: in the flowers, is how you tell when the
peak of ripeness has been reached.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be done with a naked eye,
but it's much easier with a small handheld
[SPEAKER_00]: magnifying loop here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, a 30X power is what's
recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has its own internal light,
an LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of the best ones you can
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: An ideal for determining the harvest time
and also scanning for potential insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you're looking for those resin
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them perfectly clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them perfectly milky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want them that slight
translucent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let them go too long, they'll start
to dry out and get orangey brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit too far gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just going through and
inspecting the actual buds that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: will allow you to determine the exact peak
of ripeness to maximize your harvest and
[SPEAKER_00]: yield from your crop.
Thank you.
