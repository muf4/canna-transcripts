[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video,
where I'm going to go over ozone
[SPEAKER_00]: generators if you're looking at reducing
odor associated with cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've come here to learn more about
ozone generators, you've come to the right
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Tobacco University, let's get into
ozone generators for odor control in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, ozone generators,
no surprise, use ozone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ozone is this O3 molecule,
which is simply three oxygen molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: bonded together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will remove odors from your grow
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ozone can reduce contamination such as
mold, bacteria, odors, as well as some
[SPEAKER_00]: pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ozone generators should be appropriately
sized to match your grow space and or
[SPEAKER_00]: ducting system and are the most
technologically advanced method for odor
[SPEAKER_00]: removal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see just a basic little diagram here of
what's going on inside the ozone
[SPEAKER_00]: generator.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the incorporation of UV light
fans to help move air through again and
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing the odor through this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So word of caution, if you are considering
utilizing an ozone generator, they should
[SPEAKER_00]: only be used in commercial applications in
areas that are unoccupied.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look right here, I circled it on
the unit itself, it says warning,
[SPEAKER_00]: use only in unoccupied spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because an EPA report warns
regarding ozone that when inhaled,
[SPEAKER_00]: ozone can damage the lungs, relatively low
amounts can cause chest pain, coughing,
[SPEAKER_00]: shortness of breath, and throat
irritation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ozone may also worsen chronic respiratory
diseases such as asthma and compromise the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability of the body to fight respiratory
infections.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I use an unoccupied space is
absent of humans or animals in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the ozone generation limits and the
limited benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the FDA or Food and Drug Administration
limits the amount of ozone put out by
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor medical devices to 0.04 to 0.05
parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: That number falls below the amounts needed
to provide any antibacterial and
[SPEAKER_00]: antifungal benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at the generation
levels of ozone, while the output for
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor ozone generators may be minimal,
higher levels can accumulate indoors
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the circumstances of the
growing environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 1995 EPA study found that when run on
high with the doors closed, some ozone
[SPEAKER_00]: generators produced a concentration of 0.2
parts per million to 0.3 parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is four to six times higher than the
FDA recommended standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep in mind of the generation
levels that occur to the levels they occur
[SPEAKER_00]: and the threat that they could pose to
those in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now ozone is not just hazardous to the
animals or humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the area, it also could be potentially
damaging to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ozone generators can damage plants in
indoor environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: High levels of ozone can inhibit plants in
the stomata, which are responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: water and gas regulation in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Signs of ozone damage on your plants would
be chlorosis, which is yellowing due to
[SPEAKER_00]: insufficient chlorophyll production,
necrosis, which is dying of cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: and stipples, which is tan irregular
spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see some of those represented here
on this example leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are looking at potentially
adding an ozone generator to reduce your
[SPEAKER_00]: odors, keep in mind of some of these other
environmental impacts you might want to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider to make sure it's a best fit for
your growing environment.
So thank you for watching, and have a
great day.
