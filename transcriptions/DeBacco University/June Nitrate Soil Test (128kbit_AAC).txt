[SPEAKER_00]: So on this DeBacco University video,
we're going to go over the June nitrate
[SPEAKER_00]: soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way to evaluate the nitrogen
in your soil, which is constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: changing, but this test is a good job of
evaluating that content of nitrogen in
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the June nitrate
soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, looking at that June nitrate test
here, the June nitrate test also goes by
[SPEAKER_00]: the name of pre-side dress nitrate test or
the PSNT.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was developed in the mid 1980s and was
the first soil test for nitrogen in humid
[SPEAKER_00]: regions like New England.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we typically see it associated with
corn as it is here, but it can be used for
[SPEAKER_00]: other crops as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind that while you'll see
a lot of images or a lot of correlation
[SPEAKER_00]: with it for corn, yes, that was where it
developed us from, but it is applicable to
[SPEAKER_00]: many other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The June nitrate test is commonly
associated with corn production,
[SPEAKER_00]: but can also be applied to other field
grown crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though the images might show you
here the graphs for corn, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: realize it is applicable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the data generated from this test can
be applied to other crops and field
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're seeing the soil nitrate
concentration in parts per million and the
[SPEAKER_00]: relative corn yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do see this kind of like general,
this kind of curve here where if we
[SPEAKER_00]: increase our soil nitrogen concentration
much above that region here, we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: there's really not that much increase in
relative corn yield, at least on a
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that June nitrate, the test is based on
concentrations of nitrate nitrogen or NO3N
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the soil nitrate concentration is
greater than 25 parts per million,
[SPEAKER_00]: the probability of increased yield from N
fertilizer applied to the field is very
[SPEAKER_00]: low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why with that PSNT test,
depending on what the values come back as,
[SPEAKER_00]: estimate nitrogen to apply in pounds per
acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see that there are values,
and that's typically above that 25 parts
[SPEAKER_00]: per million range, that no additional
nitrogen fertilizer would be recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's 21 to 24, about 10% likely loss,
so expected yield response, consider side
[SPEAKER_00]: dressing with 20 to 50 pounds of nitrogen
per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less than 21, we look at here,
other specific guidelines that are
[SPEAKER_00]: presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But realize about 25 and above,
really no need to apply any nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this test provide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the test provides an indication of
how much nitrogen will be available to the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop during the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit more than just a point in
time, trying to estimate during a growing
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It measures nitrate in the soil at a point
in time, but makes estimations going
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sampling is timed to match before corn
goes into the higher requirement for
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, which is why it's commonly
referred to as the June nitrate test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really for other crops as well,
sampling in June would also be
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to minimize the uncertainty
when you're making those fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations from the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this test can be performed during
other months, but typically in June a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the labs offer their quickest
turnaround time, which can be very
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're collecting a sample,
so it's kind of like a soil sample,
[SPEAKER_00]: but slightly different, because unlike
traditional mineral-based soil tests,
[SPEAKER_00]: the June nitrate test soil sample should
be collected from the surface foot of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the very top all the way down,
instead of six to nine inches,
[SPEAKER_00]: down to 12 inches down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sample should be placed in a paper bag
and gotten to the lab as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not want to put them in plastic
because that will cause the nitrogen to
[SPEAKER_00]: react and not give you a proper field
representative sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Results are sent to growers within 24
hours of being processed by the lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically only during the month of June.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's typically called the
June nitrate test.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because soil samples are collected
when corn is about six to 12 inches tall,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's actively growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So farmers need to be able to get
equipment into the field, if necessary,
[SPEAKER_00]: to add fertilizer before the plants get
too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why the lab has such a quick
turnaround time when they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the optimum rate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, excessive would be greater than 30
parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Optimum is at 20 to 30 parts per million,
and deficient would be under 20 parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million of that nitrate nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing your field history and keeping
records can help you dial in your nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: and maximize yields, while minimizing
potential for environmental contamination
[SPEAKER_00]: and increasing your overall costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here again, another recommendation
based on your soil nitrate level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at silage corn again, but
applicable to other crops as far as how
[SPEAKER_00]: much nitrogen should you add.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we can see that there are some
indications where you don't want to add
[SPEAKER_00]: any nitrogen fertilizer because you're
just not going to get any return on that
[SPEAKER_00]: investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that explains a little bit
more about the nitrate test and how you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to sample the first foot,
get the lab as quickly as possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't use a plastic bag, and it helps to
determine your nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, you may not need to add
any nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for your attention.
