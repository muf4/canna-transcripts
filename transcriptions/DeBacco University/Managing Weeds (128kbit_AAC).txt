[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we're looking at managing weeds,
which no matter the year, the weather,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the location, I can say that the weeds,
they will grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seems like it's consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Year to year, even in the smallest and
tiniest of places where you don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: want something to grow, seem like they
grow just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a whole plethora of tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to combat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go over some of them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, it's important to identify
what type of weed species you're dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can really help with the control
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's in the astra family,
we've got crabgrass, we've got the daisy
[SPEAKER_00]: family here, the gallant soga.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these different types have
different ways we can address them to best
[SPEAKER_00]: combat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So identification is an important first
step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how some growers choose to deal with it
is just mow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: High tunnels may limit the use of large
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not ideal, but it does get the job
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be careful on the mower that
you choose here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be throwing the debris out to the
right-hand side that could be damaging
[SPEAKER_00]: your crops going down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A mulching head would be better because it
doesn't throw them in any direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not to say the best, but it does
get the job done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideal, we're looking at reducing weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to keep our tunnels clean,
and it takes time and initially takes up
[SPEAKER_00]: some money to be able to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laying down some fabric material here that
does let water through, punching the holes
[SPEAKER_00]: at very precise and consistent spacings to
allow our crops to be as efficient as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could see this does reduce the
weeds, does reduce the time in season,
[SPEAKER_00]: can get a very clean look, can help with a
lot of things overall during the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great way to approach it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, these are high tunnels,
but can also, the same idea can be applied
[SPEAKER_00]: to field-grown crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mechanical mowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mowing an intended or planted cover crop
can help hold soil together and still
[SPEAKER_00]: allow for water to infiltrate through
without any residual material at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the season, such as plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be difficult to initially
get the in-between row cover established
[SPEAKER_00]: here and here, but once established,
it does offer a lot of benefits in that
[SPEAKER_00]: regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, plastic is still being used for the
main crop, but the area here, dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: that soil, dealing with that mud that
could develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just simply mowing this and have nice
clean covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it can work with plastic
ulter, it can work with row covers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it can work on the large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using that plastic mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here, if you haven't used one,
this is the type of equipment it requires.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically a decent size tractor,
depending on the mulch layer, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're pulling, depending on your
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically need a minimum of 30 to 40
horsepower to be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to use one mil embossed
plastic as recommended, because that
[SPEAKER_00]: reduces tearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing you want to do is get
halfway down your field and have this tear
[SPEAKER_00]: and have to repair or the wind catches it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can go with all sorts of issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, specialized equipment here,
but it does offer some advantages if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have the right equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That physical barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, here's our onion plants,
and then here's that same material we saw
[SPEAKER_00]: in the high tunnel or could be used in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeps the walking path clean and even
eliminates transfer of soil by workers
[SPEAKER_00]: from field to field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's two advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil borne diseases are a big issue,
and if you have one field that's
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminated, it's very easy for workers
or even yourself to walk in the field and
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer over to another field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, creating a little bit more of a
barrier, reducing the chance that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are expensive, and there's always
the weed edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here and here, there are some
still weeds that do develop around 100%,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they do reduce it significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more than just in between rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can cover an entire field,
you got to watch the wind on set up and
[SPEAKER_00]: during, so you don't want it to cut or
damage your new transplants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a plant that vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This grower here, we have some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be watermelons or could be some
squash plants that are going to vine out
[SPEAKER_00]: of melons in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, no weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean, clean fruit makes it easy to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only have your own crop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind though that mice do like this
area to kind of live in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is wise to wrap this up at the end of
the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Place sandbags in season to help hold it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the season, make sure you
wrap it up and store it outside the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Onions.
[SPEAKER_00]: To reduce weeds and frips, I suggest
growing onions in reflective or silver
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic mulch, as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silver is not necessarily the same as
gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want reflective, shiny, bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that's doing is that confuses some of
the insects, which way the sun is,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it can help reduce your frip pressure,
in particular with onions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also helps reduce the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might think, well, with onions,
I'm punching a lot of holes, right,
[SPEAKER_00]: for all my individual plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true, but there's still benefits
offered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I still recommend that if you're
planting onions, and doing them in rows,
[SPEAKER_00]: you plant on the silver or reflective
mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can really save a lot with insect
pressure later in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: With any plastic, whether it's silver,
or brown, or black, or red, or any other
[SPEAKER_00]: color that they offer, field cleanup is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time consuming, and you have to find
a way to dispose of that material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, with every pro there's a con,
something to consider when we're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to find a way to dispose of this,
and we need to take the time to remove
[SPEAKER_00]: that from our fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people use mulch between rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once established, it can offer many
benefits of manufactured weed block.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's often hard to get the mulch
to do all the rows, a lot of area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be time consuming to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers sometimes get round bales,
kind of try to roll them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used initially, but good in
between rows, in between plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, once established, it can be great,
but can be time consuming to get this all
[SPEAKER_00]: eaten orderly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also chemical control options,
such as herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many options, certain chemistries have
longer lasting effects than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to protect the main crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going down and spraying in between
rows, here we see no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice on this set up here, we have
barriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nozzles that spray in here,
killing our weeds in between rows,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going to drift over and kill our
main crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herbicides are different chemistries to
match the application.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have residuals, and that can be a
concern about drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if used effectively, as we see here,
very efficient kill, very directed,
[SPEAKER_00]: only in the area we want it, and not here.
[SPEAKER_00]: See these crops are doing just fine
without the competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick to apply over large areas,
or you can even spot spray herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to do the whole field,
you can do just one area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you miss an area, you're going to
know it, because it shows how specific
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicides can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times herbicides, oh,
they're horrible, they're going to kill
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can really see how effective they
can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in here, in a large scale application,
that grower just missed that little thin
[SPEAKER_00]: strip there, and you can see those plants
are doing just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, herbicides do allow you some
opportunities, some options, if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also no-till operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily require herbicides,
but often used in conjunction with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, to burn down the cover crop,
where pumpkins can help keep the pumpkins
[SPEAKER_00]: clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: But watch for mice, they like to hide in
this residual cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, less trips in the field,
reduces costs, allows these vining crops
[SPEAKER_00]: to vine out without much competition,
so that's some advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, especially late in the season,
the mice can start burrowing holes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: pumpkins at an increased rate,
because they have all of this forage to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of hide in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also zone tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is tilling only thin rows,
and then the plants will actually be
[SPEAKER_00]: started.
[SPEAKER_00]: This leaves most of the soil undisturbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage is it can break up soil
compaction, because it goes deeper than
[SPEAKER_00]: most tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduce fuel consumption, reduce time in
the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some examples by Jude Boucher,
he drew up some figures on time and fuel
[SPEAKER_00]: savings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduce field prep time by 66 to 83
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fuel savings, 72 to 77 percent fuel
savings, because you're only going through
[SPEAKER_00]: one area, instead of plowing and harrowing
the entire field.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage to this method does take
special equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can require a bigger tractor,
for example, a two-row zone builder here,
[SPEAKER_00]: takes about 70 horsepower is recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a four-row, it would be 120
horsepower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be out of the league for some
people, other people just may need the
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms can also share the equipment,
so that can reduce your individual costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivation, another way to deal with
weeds, can be limiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: With plant height, measure the tractor for
clearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where, if you saw my previous view
of the farm equipment, the John Deere M
[SPEAKER_00]: had a lot of ground clearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can easily run over rows, particularly
for potatoes, without a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 22 to 24 inches of ground clearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some tractors do not offer that,
so you want to be careful and mindful of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you have to space the rows a
little bit more, so you can just drive in
[SPEAKER_00]: between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times you can just drive right over
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just something to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the planning comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stale seed bed is another method.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is not to go very deep when
you're cultivating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to scuff the surface,
as these two farm all tractors show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tractors with good ground clearance
are ideal, so you can get in between the
[SPEAKER_00]: rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are trike set up here, and the wide
front here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're just kind of going through and
just scuffing the surface up to knock the
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds down, and our middle row here is our
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basket weeders are another option.
[SPEAKER_00]: This looks very similar to the Alice
Charmer G, because you're able to look
[SPEAKER_00]: down, the engine is mounted in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spacing is important on these,
and depends on the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say here you want to avoid cultivator
blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: What cultivator blight is, when the
cultivator is running down and just slips
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit to the left or right,
and cultivates the actual crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's causing the blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're actually damaging the main crop,
so you want to try to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your cultivator's got a good
coffee in the morning, and is willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: go and stay focused on watching that,
only taking the weeds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also flame weeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to have a little fun
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't till right after you flame weed,
because they're just going to bring up
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds that are deep in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to flame weed and just kill
the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good for killing recently germinated
weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can be done just after planting to ensure
the crop has a head start.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of burners here with the
tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also good in areas with impervious surface
to go through and burn them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, has its advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good example, and there's a lot
of words here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always pause the video to read
this, but carrots, as you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've grown those, inherent with
weeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timing is very important, as I mentioned
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, carrots grow slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reeds grow quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to clean the bed before weeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example someone gave.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did two rows here, planted,
and then reaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were recently flame weeded and then
flame weeded very early.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be tilled in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the amount of weed pressure
here is greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does get a little less deeper in the
row, a little further away, but this is
[SPEAKER_00]: our ideal case here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left a double rows of carrots,
four rows in total, were flame weeded and
[SPEAKER_00]: planted early.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weed pressure is near greater at the
near end and at the far end.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right-hand side, though,
several more rows of carrots were planted,
[SPEAKER_00]: flame weeded and planted two weeks later.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weeds don't all germinate at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to flame weed an area,
let it rest for a little bit, let the
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds regrow, flame weed it again,
plant, so you kind of get your crop a head
[SPEAKER_00]: start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this last forever?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but it gives your crop a big head
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where keeping records and timing
is important, because you definitely want
[SPEAKER_00]: your rows to look like this and not like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solidization is another option for you if
you have a big piece of plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used for disease control,
but it's better suited for weed
[SPEAKER_00]: suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, it's quoted as suppression for
a resting disease, and it can,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the hard part is getting it to go deep
enough into the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you do this, please don't till,
because you completed for maximum weed
[SPEAKER_00]: suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you solarize and then till,
you're bringing up those weed seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: are down deeper up to the surface,
and you're kind of negating your whole
[SPEAKER_00]: solidization process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, this plastic would be removed,
and your crop would be directly planted
[SPEAKER_00]: into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hand weeding tools are also great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stirrup hoe, one of the best weeding
tools, keeps you upright, handles in
[SPEAKER_00]: between rows real easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just kind of constantly keep after it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharpen that blade up, a little rotating
head there, and it makes it a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did pretty large areas with a little
stirrup hoe, and it works great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to keep after it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, that was helpful in reducing
your time you spend weeding this growing season.
