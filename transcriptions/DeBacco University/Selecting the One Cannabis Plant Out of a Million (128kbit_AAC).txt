[SPEAKER_00]: So welcome to this tobacco university
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be looking at selecting
the one cannabis plant out of a million,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like playing the lottery here,
finding that one unique individual that
[SPEAKER_00]: would be warranted for going through the
process, maybe of propagating and cloning
[SPEAKER_00]: and breeding out further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So realize that with plants, there's some
genetic and inherent genetic variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: When growing a population of plants,
there's some that sometimes just one just
[SPEAKER_00]: stands out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what causes that plant to stand out
may be different for different growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That standout is basically at the
discretion of the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Standouts could be the morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a tall or short plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it produce a lot of CBD or CBG for
cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of terpene profile does it have?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things to consider as well as
the time that it flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it an earlier late flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this plant tend to yield a lot of
quantity or is it a plant that is
[SPEAKER_00]: producing a lot of quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it need a lot of pruning and is it
resistant to diseases?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, which ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just some topics we'll be
covering here in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the morphology is the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, morphology is looking at
the structure of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tall plants may be better suited for
larger yields per plant, while shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are more advantageous for the
indoor market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of growers may be breeding for
those that are growing in grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a targeted audience, so that can be
advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inter-node spacing is what should be
measured, and that's the space between
[SPEAKER_00]: nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tighter inter-node spacing means it's
going to be a more compact plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and greater inter-node spacing means it's
going to be a taller plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you get those tight,
compact plants, that can also increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: density and also increase the potential
for diseases or insects to kind of hide
[SPEAKER_00]: within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So THC and CBD are what it's commonly
selected for, but some breeders are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking now into developing strains that
have greater concentrations of other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, breeding for CBG has gained
some interest for its potential uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just another consideration there that
just goes beyond the THC and the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at breeding and finding
a genetic standout.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, there's terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only are the cannabinoids
important, but the effects of a given
[SPEAKER_00]: product are receiving more attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding for and selecting a unique
terpene profile can make a strain standout
[SPEAKER_00]: and be sought after.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difficult part is that the terpene
profiles can be associated with taste and
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, which are going to be interpreted
differently by different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why typically the cannabinoids
and the percentage of those is given a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more weight or a little bit
more kind of favoritism than the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's kind of flavors what one
person may like, another person may not
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can relate to when preflowers are
first seen or when an autoflower actually
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to get into the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early flowering can help reduce the
duration needed to complete the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can be important for growers
getting more generations in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: duration of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And delaying the flower time can increase
the time in the required vegetative phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can help build a bigger plant
structure, which may be advantageous if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're seeking to breed a high biomass
producing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you can see again, the pros and
cons with each there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into just general yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much is the plant producing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, regarding yields, this can be
related to one of two main factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: One could be quantity for those looking to
just the total amount of plant product,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much product is produced by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's also quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here there'll be just looking more at
the chemicals and compounds produced and
[SPEAKER_00]: not so much the total plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, most growers would like both,
high quality and a lot of product that is
[SPEAKER_00]: of high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes you may have to select one
over the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers will sacrifice the total
quantity for improved quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can be directly related to the
terpenes produced, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to plant behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how much you want to fight
with the plant, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: How easy is the plant to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: This can refer to how well the plant
supports itself on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a strong plant, does it kind of
require or need staking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also consider how much pruning or what
pruning method might be a good fit for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's natural style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weaker plants that require staking should
be considered more for indoor applications
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to those growing outdoor or those
that want to be a little more hands off in
[SPEAKER_00]: production of their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is often overlooked, but how
resistant is a plant strain to a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: disease is can be a very important to be
bred into genetic lineages, very important
[SPEAKER_00]: trait to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can become obvious in a large growing
area of all plants have a disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there is one that disease,
quote, missed in the sense that it just
[SPEAKER_00]: simply has resistance to that because this
doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like powdery millow, for example,
would spread over the whole area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that one plant that isn't a
disease has inherent resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that can be very advantageous to any
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be a very desirable quality and
makes for a great addition to a breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program if you can get some disease
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see in the images powdery mildew,
but there's also bud rot to consider as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, as well as a host of others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different is not always better,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you're growing a thousand
plants and one of them is different,
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations are often not beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the case where they are,
growers should consider propping that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to preserve those genetics,
often cloning is suggested to ensure the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact same genetics are copied and then
multiplied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such as important mutations, typically not
a good thing, but in certain cases they
[SPEAKER_00]: can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to make sure you have methods
of preserving, recognizing that number one
[SPEAKER_00]: and then preserving those genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where attention to detail is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to look carefully at all plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping good records is an important part
of this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you happen to get lucky and find that
unique genetic kind of profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to be able to capture and
preserve it and not lose it or lose track
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that you're able to
take advantage of that unique situation
[SPEAKER_00]: because it might be truly that one in a
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that selection process that you may go
through can take a long time, even longer
[SPEAKER_00]: if you do not know what you're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even being very selective and targeted
still can take a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either select a standout plant,
continue to breed it and select for
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent repeatable qualities or
determine what you want to breed for and
[SPEAKER_00]: then start to select for those qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's two different routes you can
kind of take with the breeding process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, being attention to detail,
knowing what you're looking for,
[SPEAKER_00]: finding genetic stands out, having good
cloning procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all ways that when you identify
that one in a million, you can hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: capture that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you the best of luck in this
process if you wish to go down this route
[SPEAKER_00]: because it can be challenging and take a
lot of time, but also very rewarding in
[SPEAKER_00]: the end.
