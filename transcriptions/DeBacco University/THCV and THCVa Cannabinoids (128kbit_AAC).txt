[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
we're going to go over THCV and THCVA
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid and give you kind of some
insights into the potential future because
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not exactly sure where this one
might be going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you find this video lecture
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into THCV and THCVA
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're really interested in
cannabinoids and want to learn more,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a great research article.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to check out with some more
details for this cannabinoid as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: others you might find on this channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a great kind of information
with the citation here in reference so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can go through and learn all about the
cannabinoids that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, looking at THCV,
the active form of THCVA has been shown to
[SPEAKER_00]: have psychoactive effect and an impact on
modulating the CB1 receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has shown to be a fraction of the
strength of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it does have some similarities to
THC, it's clearly not as strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does have some of those psychoactive
effects, which is looking in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will this be regulated is something to
consider if this is shown to have
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive effects, even though it may
not be as strong as was found in the THC
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So THCV and diabetes, so there are some
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been shown to kind of ameliorate
insulin sensitivity in at least mouse
[SPEAKER_00]: models, indicating that it may prove to be
an effect of treatment for diabetes or at
[SPEAKER_00]: least a contributing factor to reducing
the negative effects of diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, it's been found to be both a
stimulant and an appetite suppressant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just other things to kind of
look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see some things listed right here
and this does warrant further research.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, looking at the future,
particularly with THCV and other variant
[SPEAKER_00]: type cannabinoids are being eagerly
studied currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon CBD has currently released a
variety of polyploid hemp that will
[SPEAKER_00]: express the variant type cannabinoids,
but they are focused on CBDV production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is difficult to predict whether or not
THCV will be tightly regulated or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: as it does have some psychoactive
potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as strong as THC, but some
psychoactive potential may cause it to be
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it should be cautiously
studied and look at the true medical
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, having the psychoactive makes
some researchers and some breeders a
[SPEAKER_00]: little wary that it might be right
regulated in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this might limit some of the initial
breeding that occurs, but it should not
[SPEAKER_00]: limit any potential chance for beneficial
clinical trials.
