[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to briefly cover gross base
humidity, because it's something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: often forgotten about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not treated properly, it can
drastically impact your plants that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what is humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the moisture in the air, like this
kind of like fog in the air, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that hanging humidity,
hanging moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature, though, does affect the
amount of water air can hold, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: an important factor to keep in mind that
that temperature regulation will also
[SPEAKER_00]: directly impact your humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warmer air can hold more moisture,
so moisture holding capacity doubles every
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 degrees Fahrenheit increase in
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why typically in the morning,
in the cool mornings, you'll find dew on
[SPEAKER_00]: the grass, because that moisture that was
in the air can come out of that air and
[SPEAKER_00]: then attach to the surfaces of the grass
blades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relating this to your grow area,
the target humidity levels will vary with
[SPEAKER_00]: the stage of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clones are 70 to 90% humidity would be
ideal, that high humidity environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as they progress and get older,
you're slowly reduce that humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vigid heat of 50 to 60%, flying 40 to 60,
and then the curing room should be the
[SPEAKER_00]: driest, a maximum of 45 to 55% humidity
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the spider webs here
showing that varying amount of humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: varying amount of moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is important to keep track of it and
also know what stage your plants are in
[SPEAKER_00]: and about where you should be as far as
humidity goes, so you're reducing the
[SPEAKER_00]: stress on those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And temperature, as I said, can influence
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of important that these two
things correlate together.
[SPEAKER_00]: For an efficient grow operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
