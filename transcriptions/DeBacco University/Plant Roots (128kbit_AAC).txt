[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to spend some time going
over a little bit more in depth of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great image that I took of one
of the plants that I was growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: showing you what the roots look like below
the soil line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here a lot of kind of root
hairs that are protruding here,
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing the surface area, allowing for
efficient water and nutrient absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So continuing on, roots in general,
they anchor the plant and they absorb
[SPEAKER_00]: water and minerals in solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important in solution needs to be in
a water solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here for anchoring the plant,
like mangroves grown down in Florida to
[SPEAKER_00]: help support this tree, and this is what
they look like kind of growing in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and some are protruding up above the
soil and continuing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these are help anchoring the plant and
also absorbing water and minerals for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to spend a little time on
this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a little initially complex,
but I want you to focus in on two points
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the xylem here, and we're
looking at getting all water and minerals
[SPEAKER_00]: into the xylem, and we do this through our
roots, particularly our root hairs,
[SPEAKER_00]: those fine structures, and there's two
main ways that we can get water and
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals uptake through the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one root here, again in no particular
order, we have the symplastic root.
[SPEAKER_00]: This involves transport of water and
minerals through the symplast or cell
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoplasm, which is linked by plasma
dismata.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plasma dismata are holes, literally holes
within the cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we follow this blue root here,
we notice that we're entering the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoplasm of the cell, and we're crossing
through the holes in the cell membrane,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we see going through here,
going through here, ultimately getting to
[SPEAKER_00]: our xylem here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the symplastic root involves
transporting water and minerals through
[SPEAKER_00]: the symplast or cell cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to contrast that, we're here going to
look at the apoplastic root.
[SPEAKER_00]: This involves transporting water and
minerals through the apoplastic root,
[SPEAKER_00]: which includes the cell walls,
the xylem, and the intercellular space
[SPEAKER_00]: between cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So notice this root, I should say,
for water and minerals is a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're noticing we're not going in the
cytoplasm here, we're going literally
[SPEAKER_00]: through the cell walls and to get to their
xylem here, staying within the cell walls
[SPEAKER_00]: and the space between those, the
intercellular space, to get ultimately to
[SPEAKER_00]: our xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now within the roots, we have something
called this endodermis here, and this
[SPEAKER_00]: casperian strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within all roots, we have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a waxy barrier, so we're in
the lipid family here, in the epiplas that
[SPEAKER_00]: force anything in the epiplas to cross the
cell membrane for filtration before
[SPEAKER_00]: entering the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll notice that this is a barrier
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're allowing some water and minerals
to come in, but there is kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: physical check that allows or prevents
certain materials from getting through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember our xylem here, which is the dead
part of the epiplast with a bulk flow up
[SPEAKER_00]: to the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see this arrow going up,
because remember xylem goes from the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: to the shoots, so that's what we're
following here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just to recap quickly,
some plastic roots going through the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoplasm, and the epiplastic root is
literally going right along the cell walls
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember our casperian strip is that
waxy barrier, particularly for the
[SPEAKER_00]: epiplastic root, allowing filtration
before getting into the xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that wasn't too bad there for
getting into the water and mineral uptake
[SPEAKER_00]: for roots to get into the xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look a little bit more deeper here
at our root structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are going to be three regions I'm
going to focus on in a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Area of cell division, elongation,
and maturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the very tip, we have something
called the root cap, and that's evident
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This protects the newly forming root tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: It secretes a lubricant to aid in the
movement of the root cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a root tip through the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember these root tips are actively
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of those apical meristems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since it magnified about 100 times,
and see the meristem, and we see some dead
[SPEAKER_00]: cells in the elongation zone, kind of
working our way up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're focused right now on this area,
the root cap, and this is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: protecting all our recently dividing cells
here as this pushes its way through the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here this is meristem,
and the numbers are listed should be one,
[SPEAKER_00]: two, three, four, and five.
[SPEAKER_00]: This elongation zone I'm going to focus in
a little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Realize the meristem, the highest rate of
mitosis occurs at this number one right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this area of cell division,
the root apical meristem is located right
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and it's protected by the root cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's to allow that root to kind of
push through the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working our way back from the root tip,
we have the area of elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our cells expand in length.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cells are not actually being moved through
the soil here, they're just expanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the root cap and meristems are the
ones actually pushing through the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here our cells are simply just expanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Area of maturation, so our cells are kind
of getting more mature, getting more
[SPEAKER_00]: specialized in our structures,
and we see the evidence of root here is
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are side shoots to the root that
can increase the surface area for better
[SPEAKER_00]: absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our vascular similar here,
remember that's our xylem inflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of puts it all together,
you can see I just simply took this image
[SPEAKER_00]: and broke it apart in different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be familiar with each and what
occurs in each of these three areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microrrhizae that I mentioned in a
previous video also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microrrhizae is a fungus root,
it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here what it looks like when
the root has a microrrhizae association
[SPEAKER_00]: versus one when it does not.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps increase the surface area of
roots to absorb nutrients and water in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: One particular nutrient of note is
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus does not move very much in the
soils, it's kind of fixed in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this microrrhizae, this beneficial
fungus, helps increase the surface area
[SPEAKER_00]: and it can help the plant uptake
phosphorus, particularly if it's low in
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: This increased web or netting increases
the contact, increasing the likelihood
[SPEAKER_00]: that these fungus will come in contact
with phosphorus that can take it up for
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the plant in return gives the
fungus some sugars that it made up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, and this is a true symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focusing a little bit more on that
casperian strip that I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is cellular feature found in roots
of all higher plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The casperian strip is a waterproof
barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that evident right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemicals must cross the casperian strip
to enter the xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it acts as a little bit of a
barrier and a way to filter things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the apoplastic root and the
symplastic root here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, symplastic is going through the
plasma desmata through simple holes in the
cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: The apoplastic root is traveling kind of
on the side here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also shows you here the plasma
desmata, those holes in the cell wall,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then our apoplastic pathway is
literally through the cell versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: symplastic pathway being through the
cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to be able to, a quick comparison,
be able to recognize what a monocot root
[SPEAKER_00]: would look like versus a herbaceous dicot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember herbaceous is referring to plants
that don't have a woody stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Woody dicot would be another example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be able to recognize what a
monocot looks like, that central kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: ring here, and herbaceous dicot kind of
has that little T, that little X,
[SPEAKER_00]: that little kind of center small circle
region and then surrounded by a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: cells here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That K center region distinguishes a dicot
from a large center region here,
[SPEAKER_00]: a monocot root.
So just be able to recognize what a
monocot root would look like versus a herbaceous
