[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at water
and carbon dioxide during the vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: growth phase of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that plants will be growing
drastically during this phase,
[SPEAKER_00]: so irrigation may need to be changed to
meet demands.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can mean changing the frequency,
the amount of times that you water those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in a day, and or the duration,
the length of time that you give those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind this is going to change as
the plants grow, as they get bigger,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be a greater demand for
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether you meet that with increased
frequency, or duration may depend on your
[SPEAKER_00]: particular operations constraints or
setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now methods of water delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hand watering, which is not
advised long-term solution, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very labor intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can, great when they're small,
can be used to kind of spot, add some
[SPEAKER_00]: plants maybe on the edge, or a plant in
your fan just getting a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: breeze on it, which shouldn't be
implemented for the entire grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flood and drain is possible if you can
implement a large tray system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a four by two tray here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a drip and emitter system we see
here on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the only way it needs to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can be very versatile and can meet
changing conditions as the plants grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: or as they switch to different rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2's impact on the veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: If CO2, if using CO2, it's recommended
basically from emergence through the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically through the entire growth
phase of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it can be most beneficial during
the vegetative phase to help increase
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass of the plant, to try to get a
bigger plant, a quicker plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: to fill an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding CO2, if you have not added CO2
before and have a set plan for your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in the sense of kind of, I know I've
seeded them on this day, I transfer them
[SPEAKER_00]: here, I flip them then, you will most
likely need to make adjustments to that
[SPEAKER_00]: original plan that you may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Odds are the plants are going to grow
quicker and larger, so this may offset
[SPEAKER_00]: initial plans that you have if you're
looking at historical data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the size of your grow space,
it may require either more space,
[SPEAKER_00]: because your plants become bigger so you
may need to accommodate for the space,
[SPEAKER_00]: or reduce time to flower, which can be
advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on a limited space and want to
maintain the same plant numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants will fill the area faster,
resulting in shorter duration to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that can be advantageous for
some growers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon dioxide specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aiming for levels of 700 to 1,000 is
advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest using 1,200 parts per million as
the maximum, simply because going beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: this level will not likely result in any
improvement in yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see this chart here going from
zero to 1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see it start to taper off here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind natural levels are right
around 400, so you can see going up to
[SPEAKER_00]: about 1,000 here, we start to level off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are getting an increase in the
photosynthetic process, but going again
[SPEAKER_00]: much below above 1,200, not really going
to give you that much greater yield and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
