[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at plants, we're probably
very familiar with the stems and the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: and the leaves, but we also have to
consider and also remember the major plant
[SPEAKER_00]: cell components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of those plant cells, what is each one
of those individual cells?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they made out of?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they contain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they contain a nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This controls the cell's actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often referred to as the command
center of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains most of the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mitochondria and chloroplasts do have
some of their own unique DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be the vast majority of the
DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the outside of the nucleus,
we have the nuclear envelope.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nuclear pores here that regulate
what can come in, what can come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is the command center,
it's very important the cell keeps this
[SPEAKER_00]: information protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mitochondria, this is the site where
food is converted into energy through the
[SPEAKER_00]: process of cellular respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does contain some of its own unique DNA
and it's the site's specifically what we
[SPEAKER_00]: call ATP synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Densine triphosphate is the energy
currency of the cell and this is the main
[SPEAKER_00]: site where it is synthesized or made.
[SPEAKER_00]: To say it's the powerhouse of the cell,
as many students will tell me it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is not really a proper reference to its
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: The synthesis of ATP is a much more
accurate description of what this
[SPEAKER_00]: organelle does.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chloroplasts contain the green
pigment, it's called chlorophyll,
[SPEAKER_00]: that capture light for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also contains some of its own unique DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a high concentration of
chloroplasts giving the plants this green
[SPEAKER_00]: color.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may notice here in New England in the
fall, some trees lose their green color
[SPEAKER_00]: and will start to turn different colors
and that's as a result the breakdown of
[SPEAKER_00]: the chlorophyll, which is located in the
chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also some other pigments,
but chlorophyll is the most dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vacuoles we see here has a large set
that contains water, stored foods,
[SPEAKER_00]: salts, pigments, and other waste products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take up the majority of the volume
of the cell, so it can vary, but it can
[SPEAKER_00]: take almost up to about 90% of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ribosomes are the site of proteins
synthesis and it's where amino acids are
[SPEAKER_00]: linked together.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ribosomes are these complex here,
we can see one indicated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to get into too much into
the protein synthesis pathway,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's where all the amino acids are
linked together to form polypeptides,
[SPEAKER_00]: also known as proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specific types of proteins would be an
example of the enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endoplasmic reticulum, or ER,
contains these interconnected network of
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane-enclosed tube-like structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's rough ER, which has ribosomes kind
of put on top here, kind of studded on
[SPEAKER_00]: top, and we have smooth ER, which is more
the site of lipid or fat synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golgi bodies are the site of protein
processing, storage, and modification.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here's our nucleus,
here's our rough ER, and then we would go
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Golgi apparatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tends to be one of the more finishing
bodies where kind of we're modifying those
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins that may have been produced from
the rough ER and just tweaking them before
[SPEAKER_00]: they may be released outside the cell or
put into the cell membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cell membrane specifically is also
known as a plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what's called a phospholipid bilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a phospholipid, and it is a
bilayer, meaning there's two layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This together helps the cell regulate what
can enter and exit the cell, causing this
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-permeable layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's present in both plant and animal
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cell wall is only present in plant
cells, so the cell membrane, plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: animal, cell wall, only plant cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here onion cells and the root tips
in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cell walls are composed mainly of
cellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cellulose is a complex sugar molecule,
giving a lot of strength and rigidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the cell stops growing, the wall
will thicken and become rigid,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not present in animal cells,
so that's kind of what gives these kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct almost box-like look appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the formation of that thick and rigid
cell wall when a plant cell reaches the
[SPEAKER_00]: point of maturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
