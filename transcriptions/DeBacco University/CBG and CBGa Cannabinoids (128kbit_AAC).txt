[SPEAKER_00]: In this tobacco university video,
we're going to go over CBG and CBGA
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and some of the more advanced
processes that these are involved as the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant goes through and produces various
other cannabinoids and where does CBG fall
[SPEAKER_00]: in that particular process.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into CBG and CBGA
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is a research article.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for more information on
this cannabinoid as well as others,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's the proper citation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go take a look at it for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting into the specifics of this
article, this video lecture, I've derived
[SPEAKER_00]: from information from that article as well
as others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the CBGA pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of looking at this before I get
into the details, looking at CBGA being
[SPEAKER_00]: located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a quick general sense, what you're
noticing is a lot of other pathways,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of other things coming down the
chain, kind of getting to this bottleneck
[SPEAKER_00]: restriction pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have CBGA and then we have a
division from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why CBGA is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got a bunch of ancillary
processes that come down to CBGA and then
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a division step from there as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that restriction point
molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that CBGA is produced, you can see
here from the GPP and OA by the synthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: of aromatic pyrimine transferase or just
AP.
[SPEAKER_00]: This biochemistry takes place in the
plastid, which is also where the pathway
[SPEAKER_00]: produces the GPP and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing some overlap to other
plant processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: GPP is shared substance in both
cannabinoids as well as terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, showing some overlap in these
pathways within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the CBGA is synthesized,
is transported out of the plastid to the
[SPEAKER_00]: highland glob into the epiplast,
which is all occurring again within that
[SPEAKER_00]: trichrome structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the conversion of CBGA to
subsequent cannabinoids takes place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those subsequent cannabinoids can be
THCA or CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CBGA is not converted into subsequent
cannabinoids, which will accumulate in the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now heat may cause a conversion to its
neutral active form, just CBG,
[SPEAKER_00]: because heat will cause CBGA to basically
be converted to CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the take home message here is if we're
more familiar with potentially THC or CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we're looking back at the chemical
processes of the plant, it all kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: originated in the CBGA production of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a plant cannot produce a lot of CBGA
or is a poor producer, it is also be a
[SPEAKER_00]: poor producer of some other potentially
cannabinoids you might be more familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the interaction with the cannabinoids
and the receptors is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBGA and CBG have been shown to interact
with cannabinoid receptors that bind to
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD and also THC modulating their effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting into this could also
potentially kind of get into competing
[SPEAKER_00]: with effects of other cannabinoids based
on how they bind specific receptors in the
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why research needs to be done to
better understand these potential
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions as well as binding steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's anecdotal reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many anecdotal reports have shown that
CBG has similar effects to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical studies have shown that CBG is a
potent androreceptor antagonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other studies have shown CBG has
antibiotic properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is worth noting that all of the general
side chain cannabinoids have shown to
[SPEAKER_00]: exhibit potential antimicrobial
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would make sense if this falls
into the same category.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned these are from more anecdotal
reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of anecdotal reports really
aren't valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need clinical trials, even though you
may say that, oh, enough people say it
[SPEAKER_00]: must be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we need those clinical trials to
have a double blind study to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: prove potential effects and maybe find
other pathways or sequences we may not
[SPEAKER_00]: have originally considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, looking at the cannabinoid
biosynthesis pathway, CBGA is a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid precursor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we see all these kind of
cannabinoid processes going through all
[SPEAKER_00]: arrows leading to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBGA, and then from there, all arrows
coming from CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This biosynthesis pathway leads through,
or at least can be restricted by CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's an important kind of
precursor to understand not only how
[SPEAKER_00]: plants produce it, but how it goes on to
produce other compounds in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That restriction point there can be vital
and great for future research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
