[SPEAKER_00]: So welcome to this video here at DeBaca
University, looking at forensics
[SPEAKER_00]: entomology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do insects relate to forensics and
their involvement within crime scenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though they're probably not the ones
committing the crime?
[SPEAKER_00]: So entomology in general, what is that
referring to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, entomology is the study of insects
in relationship to humans, environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and other organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Entomologists make great contributors to
such diverse fields, such as agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at crop loss or potential pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemistry, biology, human and animal
health, molecular sciences, criminology,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the focus today is forensics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So insects have a lot of contributions and
a lot of potential areas of study within
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple areas within science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why study insects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, insect species arrive at a corpse in
waves like clockwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at a crime scene,
why are we looking at insects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they have a very distinctive and
repeatable habit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this, it provides a good
estimation of the time that has passed
[SPEAKER_00]: since the individual has perished.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great reason why entomology
or insects are such a major focus within
[SPEAKER_00]: forensics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this forensics entomology,
flies and maggots also provide an
[SPEAKER_00]: approximate time of death, which is very
useful in cases where the body has been
[SPEAKER_00]: long dead, where we're not necessarily
fresh on the scene as happened over a
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And discovered later, entomology can play
a great role in that because only certain
[SPEAKER_00]: insects will feed and lay eggs on a dead
corpse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the forensics entomologists can study
these insects or larval cycles and
[SPEAKER_00]: thereafter, and can determine whether the
body has been dead for just one day or up
[SPEAKER_00]: to three or four weeks potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, great resource for information
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now entomologists aid in this process,
in this process of studying of the person
[SPEAKER_00]: who has passed away by identifying the
insects in the various stages of their
[SPEAKER_00]: life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only knowing what insects are
there, but are they in the egg stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: the larval stage or present as adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: By collecting and preserving insects as
evidence, this can ensure proper
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation procedures and ensure that
those insects are kind of frozen in time
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can help determine the estimate of
post-mortem interval or PMI, time between
[SPEAKER_00]: death and the discovery of the body,
which can help provide an approximation
[SPEAKER_00]: for where further investigation should be
focused on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Factors such as insect evidence,
the weather conditions that have occurred,
[SPEAKER_00]: the location and condition of the body are
all useful as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Entomologists can also testify in court to
explain insect related evidence found in
[SPEAKER_00]: the crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, they can aid by providing
expert testimony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insect species and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at the species and
the actual time that's passed by,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can calculate the heat slash thermal
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is equated in degree hours required
for each stage of, for example here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the green bottle flies life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one insect that can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibly the greatest potential source of
error is using the arthropod's
[SPEAKER_00]: successional patterns lies in the
collection of the actual specimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why entomologists would typically
be used and focused in on this area to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most only done correctly to sample the
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure we're getting a
good sample, but also we're getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: correct sampling of those insects in the
various life cycles that we may notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So insects typically that we'll be
focusing on would be like flies or
[SPEAKER_00]: beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Species may also provide clues in some
feed on fresh corpses, while others prefer
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that have been dead for a couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, proper identification can really
help a forensic scientist try to pinpoint
[SPEAKER_00]: the time of death, which can help further
investigation and allocation of resources.
