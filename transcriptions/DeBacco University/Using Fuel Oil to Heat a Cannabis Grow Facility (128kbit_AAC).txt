[SPEAKER_00]: So you're interested in learning more
about using fuel oil to heat a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: grow facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you've come to the right place here
at Tobacco University because that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm going to explain here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the details of
using fuel oil to heat a cannabis grow
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off with any oil we want to be
considerate and we take into
[SPEAKER_00]: considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly with oil we want to consider
the oil tank that's going to be required
[SPEAKER_00]: to be on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an above ground storage tank that
must have a containment in the event of a
[SPEAKER_00]: leak or a spill.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an outdoor storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pumping the oil out in cold winter months
could be a problem, could gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insulated tanks or additives to the fuel
to protect against this hazard need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: implemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just kind of that always like
the gasoline in your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oil storage tanks sometimes can have
issues in that cold winter months if not
[SPEAKER_00]: pretreated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The oil can actually gel in the tank and
cause it to become unburnable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's number two oil, which is home
heating oil, which you're most familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with if you have oil to heat your house or
facility already.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is number two oils nearly identical
to diesel engine fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a relatively clean fuel that demands
slightly more burner maintenance than a
[SPEAKER_00]: gas burner in comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cleaner due to the recent switch in
the United States to ultra low sulfur fuel
[SPEAKER_00]: that just caused it to become cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not 100% clean, but at least cleaner,
at least an improvement of what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have number four and number six
fuel oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: These oils have higher heating value than
number two fuel oil, but require
[SPEAKER_00]: preheating and a greater attention to
equipment operation because they're more
[SPEAKER_00]: viscous, which means they're thicker than
number two oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contracting for the winter fuel needs to
be when prices are low, which is typically
[SPEAKER_00]: in August.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get those contracts in and
signed usually around August or early
[SPEAKER_00]: September.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this can cause considerable
savings and money and ensure that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: a supply for the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not something you just buy
necessarily on demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is definitely advantageous to go
through and seek a contract out towards
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then lastly, there is waste oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So waste oil comes from the collection
centers from cars and trucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of this oil is cleaned and reused for
lubrication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much of it is available as fuel at a few
cents per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Waste oil that has not been processed
requires a settling tank to trap water and
[SPEAKER_00]: sludge that might be present.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have to be disposed of to meet EPA
regulations to their classification as a
[SPEAKER_00]: hazardous waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, waste oil has a heat equivalent
of about 150,000 BTUs per gallon,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very similar to number two fuel
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it can be a lot cheaper to get
potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does require some other specialized
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these are subcategories under
adding fuel oil as a heat source for a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis grow facility.
