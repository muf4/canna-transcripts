[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to look at how
different types of macromolecules are
[SPEAKER_00]: formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to realize there's four
main classifications to macromolecules,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are DNA and RNA, also known as
nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: and lipids, which also you may know as
fats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is a macromolecule?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're carbon-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they consist of a carbon-based core
with specialized groups attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go over some of those
specialized groups, but because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking here about macromolecules,
it's an organic molecule, and here the
[SPEAKER_00]: organic is meaning that there is a
carbon-based core to the molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: These groups have specialized properties
and are referred to as functional groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a carbon-based core, as I
mentioned here, because it's special
[SPEAKER_00]: groups attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: What those special groups are are
functional groups, and here's a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: main ones located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Functional group, we have the hydroxyl
group, the methyl group, the carboxyl,
[SPEAKER_00]: amino, the phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are different types of groups,
and you can see they have very distinctive
[SPEAKER_00]: structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's important that these structures
are defined because these particular
[SPEAKER_00]: structures will define the various
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hydroxyl group, we have this OH
attached to R as kind of that variable
[SPEAKER_00]: group here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, methyl group, this variable
chain is attached to a CH3.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you just some examples of some
of the functional groups related to
[SPEAKER_00]: macromolecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So macromolecules can be formed or they
can be broke down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Macromolecules are made by the process
called dehydration synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dehydration is the loss of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're losing water, we see an OH and
an H, also known as H2O, leaving,
[SPEAKER_00]: and here we now have two monomers,
two single monomer one, monomer two,
[SPEAKER_00]: are now linked together by a covalent
bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have two single monomers that
are now being linked together here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is dehydration synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're synthesizing or putting these two
monomers together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opposite of that, with a breakdown,
our macromolecules are broken by a process
[SPEAKER_00]: called hydrolysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have our two monomers linked
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're adding water, we're now creating
or breaking into two monomers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of break this word apart
into hydrolysis, hydro meaning we're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking in water, lysis means to cut or to
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these processes, both dehydration
synthesis, we're removing water to join
[SPEAKER_00]: two monomers together, and hydrolysis,
where we're adding water to kind of break
[SPEAKER_00]: apart these monomers that are linked
together, breaking apart that linkage into
[SPEAKER_00]: our individual monomers, both of these
require enzymes, and we'll have other
[SPEAKER_00]: lectures to talk about those.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part here, dehydration synthesis,
dehydration, removal of water,
[SPEAKER_00]: to put things together, to synthesize
them, and hydrolysis, taking in water here
[SPEAKER_00]: to separate out two individual monomers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organisms are primarily made of four kinds
of macromolecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to be able to identify
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbohydrates, lipids, proteins,
and nucleic acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Memoranducleic acids includes both DNA and
RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are termed macromolecules,
and they're the basic building materials
[SPEAKER_00]: and machinery for a cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working our way up from kind of
small atoms to molecules to now
[SPEAKER_00]: macromolecules, and working our way into
these are the primary molecules that are
[SPEAKER_00]: used for both the machinery and also the
building blocks for the cell.
