[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
we'll go over transitioning your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants from the vegetative stage to the
flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this may depend on the strain you're
growing or indoor or outdoor, try to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you helpful hints in all of those
situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over transitioning
cannabis from vegetative to the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: stage, sometimes called flipping the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, making the change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can depend on the starting material
and what type of plant type you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, you're growing seeds,
or do you start from clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you have a photo period dependent,
or do you have an auto flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to kind of influence
significantly when you make that change,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if the plants make that change on their
own, you're dealing with auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the seeds compared to
clones comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: When timing the transition, be aware of
the stage of root development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones tend to have an aggressive top or
vegetative growth, and they grow that a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: faster than seeds in the early stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure also to inspect the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going through any plant,
it's good to kind of take it out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can inspect the roots, make sure
the root structure one is looking healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: and well-developed before you're going to
put it under the strain of going through
[SPEAKER_00]: the flipping from the vegetative to the
flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're looking at photo period
dependent, so strains, they change from
[SPEAKER_00]: the vegetative to the flowering cycles
based purely on the duration of light or
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period that they're exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: For auto flower strains, remember the
transition space to only unplanned age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing when you started them will
influence when they're naturally going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go through that flip automatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those growing photo period strains,
you have a little bit more options,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at when do you decide to
make that flip of the photo period from
[SPEAKER_00]: the vegetative stage to the flowering
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can also depend, as I said,
indoor, you have that control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors, not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: These transitions will occur for both
indoor and outdoor locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: For indoor locations, offer more grower
control of timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind for the indoor growers that
might be growing in grow tents or ceiling
[SPEAKER_00]: height limited areas, plants are still
going to continue to grow vertically after
[SPEAKER_00]: you change their vegetative to flowering
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to run them all the way
to the top and then flip them thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to stunt and stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still going to continue to
stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: For outdoor growers, this will require
growers to make decisions based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions that are out of growers'
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning the photo period is going to
change naturally in the outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the outdoor grower has control over
is when they start those plants or when
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants go in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can influence and time it well with
the natural photo period to match up when
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll naturally change over and flip to
match so that you'll have a well-developed
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the great debate of leaves versus
buds, vegetative or flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a need for a plant to produce
quality leaves and good morphology to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to support flowers or buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: While growers tend to focus on the buds,
it is important to consider the general
[SPEAKER_00]: plant shape and productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have enough leaves to capture
the sun, they won't have enough energy to
[SPEAKER_00]: push quality buds or flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without a quality plant structure,
the buds will suffer so timing is
[SPEAKER_00]: important for growers to maximize this
total production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a little bit of a balance,
documentation both in written and picture
[SPEAKER_00]: form to know when you flipped your plants
is important to try to determine did you
[SPEAKER_00]: leave in the vegetative stage too long?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you not leave in the vegetative stage
long enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you getting the quality production and
are you getting it in the maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this gives you a little
insight in making that transition from the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative to the flowering stage
depending on your specific conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
