[SPEAKER_00]: What's becoming very popular in the
cannabis industry, and for good reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: is called integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, the cannabis industry is
seeking integrated pest managers to help
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigate pests while minimizing impacts on
the plant and final products produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're interested in learning more
about this job, continue watching this
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco university video.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into learning about a
cannabis integrated pest manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, their general job
description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it may be a little varied.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may depend on the size of the
institution you're working at,
[SPEAKER_00]: but integrated pest management,
or IPM, a spray technician is one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: They provide daily care for the crops in
keeping them healthy, looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: potential infestations, as well as
disease, and correcting them as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are responsible for a kind of quality
assurance specialist as they perform
[SPEAKER_00]: inspections and testing of products as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they make the final approval for
shipments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Involved in this, we're looking at that
IPM, that pest management communication,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to mitigate or reduce the chance of
any negative impacts on the crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: while also mitigating any sort of negative
effects on the long-term end products
[SPEAKER_00]: being produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, spraying pesticides might be
a great way to control an insect,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's going to leave a potential
residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe looking at utilizing cultural
practices or beneficial insects might be a
[SPEAKER_00]: great way to get the same level of control
for an insect, while still reducing the
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of any sort of contaminants being
passed on to the final end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are their day-to-day activities?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, their spray technician is they
inspect all plants and rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That inspection is very important,
scouting and attention to detail is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they do find any infestations,
they need to assess those infestations and
[SPEAKER_00]: the degree of severity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, maintaining records to know when an
infestation came in, what room it was in,
[SPEAKER_00]: is important for documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also involved in taking plant
samples, as well as samples of potential
[SPEAKER_00]: disease or insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they complete spray assignments when
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also maintain proper equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They assist in data entry and track and
trace, which is a very important process
[SPEAKER_00]: of the documentation involved with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you're looking at kind of
getting into like, oh, have an insect have
[SPEAKER_00]: a disease, go and grab a chemical and
spray, that's the very last part,
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly because we have the toxicity level
being the greatest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cultural practices using good
sanitation and habits change and analyzing
[SPEAKER_00]: those is a great initial step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physical or mechanical ways to kind of
eliminate a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then looking at biological means and then
chemicals kind of the last resort and kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of the conventional methods is the
absolute last resort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it may take care of the problem,
but it may have other negative side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects to the final crop or production
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the qualities a person must have
if they're looking at pursuing this as a
[SPEAKER_00]: potential career?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, bachelor's degree in biological
sciences or agricultural sciences is
[SPEAKER_00]: usually required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basic knowledge of plant pathology and
pest identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowledge of associated safety
precautions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Field experience is usually advised
because there's a lot of outdoor grows and
[SPEAKER_00]: insects outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Computer alertacy to be able to kind of
integrate everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ability to conduct repetitive tasks and
lift 50 pounds for a lot of movement of
[SPEAKER_00]: products and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relevant professional licenses if you're
looking at our spraying something must be
[SPEAKER_00]: at least 21 years old or older and must
successfully pass a comprehensive
[SPEAKER_00]: background check to work at a cannabis
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the specific connections to cannabis
facility is an IPM technician and quality
[SPEAKER_00]: assurance specialist ensure that the
medicinal product being processed follows
[SPEAKER_00]: all proper testing requirements and
regulations for the state that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: working in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, different states will
have different rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without these vigorous testers,
the quality of the cannabis available
[SPEAKER_00]: today would be unregulated, unhealthy,
and possibly dangerous to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers if proper health standards were
not met.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this manager that's coming in and
making sure that any products that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: applying to get the end result that they
want are going to have the least amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: potential impacts on the actual final
cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be the dry flower,
that could be the end product going
[SPEAKER_00]: through and then going through the
extraction process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very important, good communication
skills to work with others involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is gaining popularity and for
good reason to produce still a quality end
[SPEAKER_00]: product with minimum chance of failures
for pesticides or microbial analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much for joining us.
Thank you.
