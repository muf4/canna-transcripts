[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at active
forms of hydroponic systems, the basics of
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes they require a pump or in some
way to move water that might be considered
[SPEAKER_00]: unnatural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, not necessarily a bad thing,
but something that we need to do to make
[SPEAKER_00]: that water move where we want it to so
it's efficiently delivered to our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's many more options with active
hydroponic systems compared to those
[SPEAKER_00]: passive systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: These passive systems rely on capillary
action and a wick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have an increased amount of
options to move these nutrient solutions
[SPEAKER_00]: due to the diverse amount of water pumps
that are available that will be scaled in
[SPEAKER_00]: size to fit particular operations to
maximize efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are recirculation pumps and these
are systems in place that will reuse
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient solution and reduce loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of that recirculation,
that kind of recycling of that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if this system is not clean and
it includes all parts of the system,
[SPEAKER_00]: disease can spread very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if this one container
became infected or recircling that water
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst all of these containers,
they could all transmit that disease and
[SPEAKER_00]: all become infected and cause the entire
area here of production to have a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there are one-way systems and these
often lead to increased cost due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: waste generated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of pumping the water one way
and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to also cause an area of soil
or water contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, this is a lot of times with
overhead systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many hydroponic systems will reuse some
form of recirculation and this is why
[SPEAKER_00]: cleanliness is so important.
