[SPEAKER_00]: Ever wonder what reflective wall material
you should use for your grow tent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to investigate that
question here on DeBaco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at some of the
reflective wall options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, when we're setting up a
grow tent or a grow room, you may wonder,
[SPEAKER_00]: what should we put the walls with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Since indoor growing areas will have walls
and growers are paying for that light,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to maximize the efficiency of
those light units that you're paying for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since indoor areas have walls,
maximizing the reflectivity of those walls
[SPEAKER_00]: can be a simple way to provide plants more
light without increasing costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kamas is a high light demand plant,
so a good reflective surface is
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the data presented here is from the
video here on MicroLight.com here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He presents pretty good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just providing a summary, but I
welcome you to check that video out for
[SPEAKER_00]: more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the equipment that he used there are
looking at a 600 watt HPS with a wing
[SPEAKER_00]: reflector, and he also used a 400 watt LED
panel, which is a Mars Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: No reflectors in the fixture, high-power
purple light fixture there was utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not these exact images, but gives you a
good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: How he's measuring light was with a
quantum sensor, the Apogee SQ500 here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, let's start with the
control, and that is basically no walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just set up kind of a growing box
in a bigger room and put any walls,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, looking at the amount of light that
was gotten and received, 640, this is
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFD, is what they're measured in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All other trials will be provided a
percent of increase from this baseline
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 640 and 400 are our baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's if we had a grow area with no
walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we put the walls up with just a
plain wooden wall, which would be kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: our most basic form of walls, well,
we get a 7.81% increase of our HPS and a
[SPEAKER_00]: 5% increase with our LED, and we could see
the PPFD readings that we are up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we upgrade or take those wooden
walls and put a white paint on that,
[SPEAKER_00]: a matte white paint, we see an 18.75%
increase and a 10% increase from those
[SPEAKER_00]: base levels where there were no walls
added originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here we're getting a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what if we use white marble,
which is like a shiny plastic material?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that for HPS, it had the same
PPFD as the matte white paint and on plain
[SPEAKER_00]: wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not as much of a benefit there to add
the plastic for high pressure sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: setup, but for LEDs, we saw a little bit
more of an increase, 12.5 over no walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, so there's silver mylar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of getting the white,
what about the silver, the aluminum coated
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, definitely saw an increase in both
in the high pressure sodium and the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what got us the greatest or what was
creating the data with the greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: increase with that photosynthetic light
activity was the silver mylar with the
[SPEAKER_00]: diamond pattern, very commonly found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And grow tint materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see why that only is an
increased amount of reflective light,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also reduces the chance for hotspots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is all this data?
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw it kind of in one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I just kind of put all here in a
nice little summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see how no walls with our baseline,
plain wood, white matte painted on the
[SPEAKER_00]: wood, white mylar, silver mylar and the
silver mylar and the diamond pattern,
[SPEAKER_00]: how that did generate the greatest return
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a grower looking at set up a
grow room, what would I suggest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, basically your light source is less
important than the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surface used while any clean wall surface
will benefit over no wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using silver mylar with diamond patterns
results in the greatest amount of light
[SPEAKER_00]: reflected.
[SPEAKER_00]: This material is found in most grow tents,
but make sure it is in your growing space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, consider adding it so you get the
greatest reflectivity of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less light loss that you're paying for
anyway to hopefully maximize your plant production.
