[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this tobacco university.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be exploring a video here on
polyplotization for the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement of cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically, we're going to be
breaking down a scientific study that
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at investigating this particular
type of poly of ploidy levels in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're talking about ploidy levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep in mind we are diploid
organisms, so polyplotings referring to an
[SPEAKER_00]: abnormal or an increased number in copies
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll explain that more as the video
goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, I want to be mindful that this
is the research article.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to look at it yourself,
provided with the reference here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the citation and a direct link,
as well as a copy of the first page here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what is this
polyplotization?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is the multiplication of the
whole chromosome complement that has
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred frequently in vascular plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as a quick biology review,
your haploid is your gametes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, if we're talking about
plants, this would be your egg cells or
[SPEAKER_00]: your pollen grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diploid would be the normal organism,
but here we're looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: polyplotization, the 3N or the tetraploid,
the 4N, multiple copies here from what
[SPEAKER_00]: would be considered normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The maintenance of a stable polyploid
state over generations requires specific
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms to control pairing and
distribution of more than two homologous
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes during meiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just a brief overview of what
we're investigating here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to see how this actually changes
the cannabis plant's morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, why investigate this in the
first place?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the justification for even
considering this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, polyplotization is considered a
valuable tool in the genetic improvement
[SPEAKER_00]: of crop plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The evolutionary success of polyploid
plants in nature and under domestication
[SPEAKER_00]: has been attributed to the buffering of
mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this in comparison, looking at the
regular diploid compared to some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other types of ploidy levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most evident here with the strawberries,
we have a wild strawberries to our
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivated strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone wants larger, bigger fruits,
and this is kind of one way potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: through genetics and these ploidy levels
to accomplish this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking specifically now at cannabis,
leaf stomata morphology of mature fan
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing this comparison here of A
is diploid, B is tetraploid, and we see
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing here with the stomata with
C and D.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the leaves collected after four weeks
of vegetative growth and one week under
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when this material was collected
from the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down here, this black and white images,
we're looking at nail polish impressions
[SPEAKER_00]: to show the stomata on the kind of
underside surface of the fan leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: the abaxil surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we talk about nail polish
impressions, that's literally kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: way that you can put nail polish down and
kind of lift that to get an idea of what
[SPEAKER_00]: the stomata look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, the stomata are the pores in the
underside of the leaves that regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: water loss and carbon dioxide intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stomata appear larger in size on the
tetraploidy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These bars represent the same size.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see these are clearly larger than the
diploid organisms here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then looked at trichome density.
[SPEAKER_00]: So specifically speaking to trichomes,
which is very important in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at trichomes,
the images show the trichome density,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, at that same leaf surface there of
the fourth sugar leaf of cannabis sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants A and B are diploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's A and B.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are both diploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: C and D are the tetraploid down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves were imaged on the seventh week of
flowering and note the scale bars are one
[SPEAKER_00]: millimeter to give you a size comparison
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can clearly see if there is definitely
more trichomes or increased density here
[SPEAKER_00]: on the tetraploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the inflorescence architecture,
looking at the specific colas or the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inflorescence apex, top cola and buds
shown for two plants during the eighth
[SPEAKER_00]: week of flowering of cannabis sativa
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week 12 after transplanting and one week
before harvest to give you an idea when
[SPEAKER_00]: this was occurring in this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A and B are diploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, A and C are the diploid here in
that same column here.
[SPEAKER_00]: B and D here are the tetraploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: In images, A and D represent the cola and
C and D represent the bud morphology,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking a little bit closer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're not seeing stark differences
here, but if you look at them long enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can definitely see that there are some
morphological differences in the influence
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking more at the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the large scale look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how does these actually compare when
we look at some of the graphs in data
[SPEAKER_00]: generated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the phytochemical content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dried buds and leaves of cannabis sativa
plants of different ploidy were assessed
[SPEAKER_00]: using HPLC and GC for cannabinoids and
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's high pressure liquid chromatography
and gas chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are abbreviations.
[SPEAKER_00]: A is the cannabinoid profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see right up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And B is the terpene profile, the chart
down at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Data are means plus or minus the standard
error where 10 diploids and nine
[SPEAKER_00]: tetraploids were analyzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Means of different upper and lowercase
letters are significantly different using
[SPEAKER_00]: the ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test with
a P value greater than 0.05.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you an idea of the statistics
behind this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's the summary here?
[SPEAKER_00]: As we kind of look at the bars in
different colors, what are we looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the phytochemical content in the
lower leaves is high enough for the trim
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf material to be used for extraction in
both ploidy levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Studies which could almost double the
total production yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important to remember that the trim
leaf material also does contribute to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain a level that would be worth going
through the phase of extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total terpene content of tetraploid leaves
is comparable to the diploid bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And terpene extracts from the tetraploid
leaves may have commercial value despite
[SPEAKER_00]: low levels of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kind of see that comparison there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at our diploid and our tetraploid,
our differences here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, everything is reduced in the leaf
overall, but does give it some thought
[SPEAKER_00]: there as far as potentially taking that
material, not just discarding it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but going through the process of
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here in the diploid, we see the leaves
being lower than the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see the leaves overall being a
little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that bud definitely being a B,
making it a little bit higher there,
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating more genetic similarities here,
but being distinctly higher in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tetraploid bud compared to the diploid
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just looking at some of the
stats, we can clearly see there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: differences on the phytochemical content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what do these results indicate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, tetraploid cannabinous plants
generally grow comparable to traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: diploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good note for those that are
actively growing this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to behave pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tetraploid cannabis plants reduced
rooting was noted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that just might be an area of concern
or something to keep an eye on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tetraploid cannabis have a similar
chemical profile to diploids with notable
[SPEAKER_00]: increases in CBD and subsequent terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that increase in CBD is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what makes it advantageous to
be potentially considering this as a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower here of producing cannabis to look
at tetraploids potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's that kind of grower's
suggestion, general summary?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, using polyploidization in cannabis
plants may be an effective method for
[SPEAKER_00]: maximizing CBD and terpene production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very important note there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to make note that if you do read
the article in a little bit more detail,
[SPEAKER_00]: they do state that really they did not see
much of a change in the THC levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was noticed in CBD and definitely
terpene production for these polyploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just something there to
consider, something you may not have been
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking of before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this just allows or shows how
scientific research can really potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: continue the breeding process in the
improving of cannabis plants.
