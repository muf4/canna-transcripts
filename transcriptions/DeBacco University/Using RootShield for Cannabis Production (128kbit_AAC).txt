[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this Tobacco University video
we're going to be looking at a product you
[SPEAKER_00]: might be familiar with called Root Shield
and see how it relates to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this video I'm going to go over
using Root Shield for cannabis production
[SPEAKER_00]: and give you some studies that looked at
investigating the effectiveness of this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off here is a reference poster
and here's the long link you can also see
[SPEAKER_00]: in the description linked to all
resources, but this is also the poster
[SPEAKER_00]: where they looked at Fusarium in
particular with some other biological
[SPEAKER_00]: controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll provide you the general summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what is Root Shield?
[SPEAKER_00]: I figure I should just first off describe
what it actually is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does have active ingredients and
this is there's Root Shield and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: Root Shield Plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the plus stand for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it contains two versions of
trichoderma, two different strains of
[SPEAKER_00]: trichoderma here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is trichoderma?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an organic biological fungicide with
dual active ingredients, since we have
[SPEAKER_00]: those two strains there, to prevent a
broad spectrum of root diseases and
[SPEAKER_00]: promote a healthy root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's registered for use in the United
States, except Alaska, REI of four hours
[SPEAKER_00]: and post-hours interval of zero days.
[SPEAKER_00]: This biological control agent has been
reported to be effective against a range
[SPEAKER_00]: of root pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this study, Root Shield Plus,
WP, which stands for wettable powder,
[SPEAKER_00]: was applied at a rate of 0.02%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at biological control,
biological fungicides in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: the evaluation of biological agents
against pathogenic fungi can be
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging due to the environmental
variability that naturally exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to look at these studies and
kind of see if they apply, see what
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions had occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at comparisons,
focused on a single pathogen, may seem
[SPEAKER_00]: limiting for growers' viewpoint,
but it does offer some degree of useful
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully you find that with this
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Fusarium, I'll look at the Oxosporium
and Polyphyteterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pathogens have been isolated from
all stages of plant growth, from
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative cuts to mother plants that
typically show as wilt systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a grower may recognize, I know it's a
pepper plant, but may recognize these
[SPEAKER_00]: wilting systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at it through a
microscope, this is what the Fusarium
[SPEAKER_00]: would actually kind of look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're associating with a root.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to plate it on a Petri dish,
this is what it may look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So treatments impact on disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get the study presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root Shield containing Trichodermin,
reduced infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Negative control means a control plant
that was grown without any disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a positive control is when it was
inoculated with disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see how these different
products compare and how they definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: show different degrees of effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the conclusion based on the
cannabis data provided there was that Root
[SPEAKER_00]: Shield did produce a notable level of
disease reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, Regalia produced a statistically
significant level of disease reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to go back to that for a second,
this is where Regalia was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was shown in that study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on this data, Regalia may be a
better option, but Root Shield would still
[SPEAKER_00]: be potential for offer some protection and
it may offer reduction in other diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it should be considered as a potential
biopesticide when it comes to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, this would be root applied and
drenched as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found another article here looking at
the Trichoderma and kind of presented
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm providing just a general
overview this was looking at growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: development of CBD content of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the study specifics, we're looking at
the study aimed to investigate the effect
[SPEAKER_00]: of Trichoderma Hysterium inoculation on
agronomically and quality characteristics
[SPEAKER_00]: of two Moniches hemp varieties,
Fedora 17 and Felina planted in 12 liter
[SPEAKER_00]: pots filled with soil and eight liters of
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the study for more details on
exactly the materials and methods if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to learn more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the product they used was
Trichoderma Hysterium and was a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the details provided here with the
concentration of that product as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a greenhouse pot experiment was
conducted in a complete randomized design
[SPEAKER_00]: of two treatments of the Trichoderma
Hysterium, both at a low and a high dose
[SPEAKER_00]: represented by T1 and T2.
[SPEAKER_00]: The split applications were carried out
through fertigation at 10 and 30 days
[SPEAKER_00]: after sowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is in the ground, so the plants 10
days after and the next one was 30 days
[SPEAKER_00]: after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see the control where no
amount was added, T1 and T2 where they
[SPEAKER_00]: basically doubled the amount of applied
fungal spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yield characteristics related here to
the CBD content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yield characteristics in CBD content was
affected by different Trichoderma
[SPEAKER_00]: Hysterium treatments in hemp varieties for
the Fedora 17 and also Felina.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're looking here percent CBD,
we are seeing a change and these letters
[SPEAKER_00]: represent statistics that lead different
levels there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can pause the video and take a
look at the bud dry weight, the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: length, the bud compact index,
the percent CBD and also the CBD yield
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed in grams per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the conclusion of their study?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you looked, you can go back and pause
the data, but the conclusion was the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest values of plant height and dry
weight were noticed with T2, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Felina variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichoderma Hysterium positively
influenced characteristics of
[SPEAKER_00]: inflorescence such as the number,
fresh weight moisture and compactness in
[SPEAKER_00]: both varieties while the dry weight length
and dry yield of inflorescence was not
[SPEAKER_00]: improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, the fertigation of Trichoderma
Hysterium in hemp plants was beneficial at
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing cannabidiol or CBD content,
especially in the elevated treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here's just comparison of the
control to the treatment levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something based on this data you may want
to consider adding to your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run a control, run a trial yourself,
see if it does make a difference,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at least there's some data here to
support that it might be worth the
[SPEAKER_00]: investment in labor to incorporate into
your growing operation.
