[SPEAKER_00]: Looking specifically at the immune system,
our body needs many defenses because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: under continual attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our body needs to build like a fortress to
help protect itself, but this isn't good
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only does it need to have a fortress,
it also needs ways to mobilize quickly to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to defend itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if something is able to breach the
borders and get by the initial first
[SPEAKER_00]: response, it needs a way to be able to
hunt down and destroy those invaders
[SPEAKER_00]: within our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking specifically at a wonderful video
that I can have a love-hate relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: with personally, it's a great video and
has great animation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to check this link out.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, some of the terms they use to
describe that I feel don't go into as much
[SPEAKER_00]: science as I would like.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, I've provided some key
translations here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, when they use purple things,
that stands for virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're able to watch the video and be
able to at least immensely translate their
[SPEAKER_00]: terms into what those actual correspond
with regarding the cell, then you probably
[SPEAKER_00]: have developed a good understanding of
what's going on in that particular video
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part is our body's under constant
attacks, so we need a way to help protect
[SPEAKER_00]: and maintain borders and also address
invaders that occur to avoid the body
[SPEAKER_00]: having its machinery being used for
purposes that do not benefit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you approach this problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a general idea of the immune
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, step one is to secure the borders,
kind of have a good strong and
[SPEAKER_00]: well-maintained skin in our case,
that physical barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, you want to mobilize
quickly to block a breach.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a cut in your skin,
you want to be able to rush some help out
[SPEAKER_00]: to that area to prevent infection from
spreading to the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, third line of defense is to hunt
down successful invaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those microorganisms that are able to
penetrate and get into our body,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to have a system in place that's
able to seek them out and destroy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This general summary, a little bit more
detail, would be the first line to secure
[SPEAKER_00]: the borders is basically to prevent the
problem from occurring in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes an ounce of prevention is better
than a pound of correction, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skin, mucous membranes, try to prevent or
at least limit the entry of
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, keep in mind, not every microorganism
is completely harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have many that we depend on,
but we're looking here at the specific
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that want to do the body harm,
certain pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to securing the borders,
we need a way to mobilize quickly to block
[SPEAKER_00]: a breach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Antimicrobial proteins, phagocytotic cells
to localize an invasion and potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: control it right then and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to repair the border is the
ultimate solution and this is why our skin
[SPEAKER_00]: will scab over to kind of help maintain
that physical barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, inflammation is the hallmark
and most important mechanism to help block
[SPEAKER_00]: and limit the potential spread of
organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, our third line of defense is to
hunt down successful invaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to profile the enemy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this takes a little time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch, immobilize, and destroy invaders
within the body fluids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This identifying, destroying, and removing
the body cells that are already infected
[SPEAKER_00]: is a time-consuming process and is where
the immune system needs to take some time
[SPEAKER_00]: and to be able to clear out those invaders
that have been able to get into our body
[SPEAKER_00]: and sometimes that's why we're sick for a
couple days and then ideally get better
[SPEAKER_00]: while this process is occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
