[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to focus on heart
anatomy, being able to identify certain
[SPEAKER_00]: sections of the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this lesson, we're going to focus
on the four chambered heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the heart location,
we're going to focus on the human heart in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's about the size of your fist,
that's proportional for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its location is superior surface to the
diaphragm, left of the midline,
[SPEAKER_00]: anterior of the vertebral column,
and posterior of the sternum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is not located perfectly in the
center of your body, it is left of the
[SPEAKER_00]: midline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, these terms, superior,
anterior, posterior, left of the midline,
[SPEAKER_00]: all come into play yet again, as we see
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the mammalian or bird circulation,
all take advantage of this four chambered
[SPEAKER_00]: heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we're focusing on humans,
a lot of this same would apply to mammals
[SPEAKER_00]: and birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: One pumps, one portion of the heart pumps
blood to the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called the pulmonary circuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, pulmonary arteries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other portion of the heart pumps
blood to the rest of the body called the
[SPEAKER_00]: systemic circuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two pumps operate together within a
single unit of the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the vertebrate heart are separated
into two types of chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the atria, or singular atrium,
as you see here, our right atrium and left
[SPEAKER_00]: atrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They receive blood from the body,
or the lungs, and contractions of the
[SPEAKER_00]: atria send blood through a valve to the
ventricles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically taking the blood here and
sending it to the ventricles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ventricle portions here, they receive
blood from the atria, and they contract to
[SPEAKER_00]: send blood to the body or the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So notice here, the muscles here for the
ventricles are much larger than that of
[SPEAKER_00]: the atria, the atrium up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because the ventricles have to
send all the way to the lungs,
[SPEAKER_00]: or even a greater distance to the rest of
the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we see this larger muscle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The atrium is simply collecting the blood
and pumping it to the ventricles.
[SPEAKER_00]: A human circulatory system, again,
you can see it is quite complex,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of arteries, a lot of veins going
through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This diagram kind of gives you an idea of
the percentage of blood and where it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What might be interesting if you look,
okay, three, three, the bones,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, the skin, 6%, 6%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The liver is only receiving 6% directly to
it, but 27% is leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because the liver has such a strong
connection to the gastro, GI system,
[SPEAKER_00]: gastrointestinal system, and also the
spleen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while 21% of the blood's going there,
it's not leaving there, it's being
[SPEAKER_00]: diverted and going to the liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the liver's very important for blood
filtration, and as a result, only gets 6%
[SPEAKER_00]: directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get that additional 21% indirectly,
so 27% goes back to the veins and leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: the liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dual pump operation, this GIF kind of
shows here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The four-chambered heart acts as two
pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, the atria contract, forcing blood to
the ventricles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the ventricles contract, forcing
blood through the arteries to the lungs
[SPEAKER_00]: and the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cycle ends and the heart relaxes and then
repeats again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that here's our atria sending it
to the ventricles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ventricles are pumping and sending
that, in this case, this would be going to
[SPEAKER_00]: the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, this would be going to the
rest of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see our valves here opening and
closing, allowing blood to be controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: and pumped in efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping time, the sinoatrial node,
the SA node, is the nervous tissue that
[SPEAKER_00]: times the heartbeats.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SA node causes the atria to contract
and sends a signal to the atrioventricular
[SPEAKER_00]: node, which is also known as the AV node,
and that's located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a sense of a slight delay,
which is a good thing, because once our
[SPEAKER_00]: atria can contract, that signal is then
being sent to the ventricles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being sent to the AV node and
signaling the ventricles to contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: If these both contract at the exact same
time, blood would have nowhere to go and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything would just lock up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need the blood to go from the atria
here to get to the ventricles,
[SPEAKER_00]: a slight delay before then it's sent out
to either the lungs or the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cystal pumping and diastole is filling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see our cystals, the actual pumping,
and diastoles at filling portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the part with cardiac cycle
during which the heart refills with blood
[SPEAKER_00]: after emptying done from the systole or
the contraction stage there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need a filling stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a slight delay so that blood can
fill in, in this case to our ventricles,
[SPEAKER_00]: before being pumped out to either the
lungs or the rest of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the timing is very important in the
sense of what contracts when, and there
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be a slight delay to allow that
blood to kind of fill and accumulate and
[SPEAKER_00]: then seal those valves up before it's
pumped to the next portion of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart valves is kind of an interesting gif
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps control blood flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be able to open completely to
allow for efficient blood flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also needs to close very tightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see some locations in the names of
those particular valves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tricuspid valve has actually three
components to it, pulmonary valve here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the mitral valve, and the aortic valve
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each of them is labeled differently and
that's going to help us when we start
[SPEAKER_00]: tracking blood flowing through the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see them opening and closing here and
how much that heart does kind of move here
[SPEAKER_00]: as our atria contract and you can notice
our valves here opening and then closing
[SPEAKER_00]: tight and these valves are opening,
allowing blood to come in and force its
[SPEAKER_00]: way through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important that all these valves
open and close efficiently to allow blood
[SPEAKER_00]: to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the heart sounds, there's kind of a
love dub and that's occurring due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: opening and closing of valves and the
pressure that's being built up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what gives the heart its sound is that
simple opening and slamming close of the
[SPEAKER_00]: valves as the heart, that muscle,
is constantly moving and forcing blood to
[SPEAKER_00]: different regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, our heart murmur is the easiest
method for diagnosis is to listen to it
[SPEAKER_00]: with a stethoscope here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If valves are not fully open or closing,
turbulence gets created and this is what's
[SPEAKER_00]: called the heart murmur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically this is done on newborns and
young individuals here who just listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: the heart and we're trying to having that
distinct love dub.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, there's that murmur and that's
causing of turbulence and that could
[SPEAKER_00]: indicate there might be a problem with one
of the valves either not fully opening or
[SPEAKER_00]: not fully closing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
you
