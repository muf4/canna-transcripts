[SPEAKER_00]: As the title implies, I'm going to be
going over transplanting, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: critical step, especially when we're
growing container-grown crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how and when to transplant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, once the clone is filled its
container, you want to remove it and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: it into a larger container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can vary depending on the size
container it originated in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one that originated in a very small
plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you water the clone, flip the
container upside down and place it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-made hole into the larger container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to water everything in and keep it
under constant conditions to reduce plant
[SPEAKER_00]: shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants that are transplanted late will
become pot bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a little bit of a timing
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to wait too long or go too
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be one that would go much
longer than that just looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of roots in this plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suggested container size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically three-gallon pots to
ten-gallon pots are what's commonly used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three-gallon pots are typically
recommended for plants up to about three
[SPEAKER_00]: feet tall and are advised for plants that
are two to three-ish months old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven-gallon containers can hold a plant
for its full term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people prefer ten-gallon containers
and hold a plant for over a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: To some extent, when you get into like
seven or ten-gallon pots, it comes down to
[SPEAKER_00]: personal preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers really like the tens,
some really like the sevens, some are
[SPEAKER_00]: transitioning from one to another or
trying different sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no quote set one-gallon pot
size that will work in all instances.
[SPEAKER_00]: When selecting our container size,
it's debated but larger containers use
[SPEAKER_00]: more media and are often more forgiving
and can reduce plant stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a specific variety habit can
dictate what size the containers use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have the image here, there's always kind
of pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of got to weigh each side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better containers are more forgiving with
these more media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, whatever fits your condition,
people have grown great plants in a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of sizes of containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The container material though is
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, there's solid wall and there's
breathable materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solid walls reduce water loss but can
cause roots to kind of circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breathable materials such as grow bags or
in this case, we have the slats cut in
[SPEAKER_00]: here can cause root pruning which helps
create a dense root ball without the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: getting root bounds called kind of air
pruning that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, both of these in this case,
there's the same size or gallon size but
[SPEAKER_00]: very different methods and we have to
consider both options and figure out what
[SPEAKER_00]: works best.
[SPEAKER_00]: When transplanting, during transplant
process, it's a good time to inoculate
[SPEAKER_00]: roots if you choose to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it's typically a good amount of root
surface area to come in contact with
[SPEAKER_00]: applied products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a requirement but can allow for a very
efficient transfer of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants can also be watered in with low
dose fertilizers at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really want to go with high dose
because of those freshly exposed roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd have the chance of burning them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grower induced root pruning, well,
why cut the roots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it can help restart plant that has
become pot bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get something that's really dense
and pot bound, you can go through and cut
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these roots to help rejuvenate the
plant, kind of get it back going.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be encouraged to start growing
again even it's kept in the same size
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a plant out, cut some of the roots
and put it right back in the same size
[SPEAKER_00]: container because the root mass has been
reduced causing that kind of tricking the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to kind of rejuvenate itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proper media fill height.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers often want to fill the pot to
the very top because kind of like the ice
[SPEAKER_00]: cream cone effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see this in this instance
where the potting means right up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to leave about this two to three
inch gap to the lip to the soil line.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows you to combine hand water very
easily and ensures all the media remains
[SPEAKER_00]: in the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you fill the media high, it's going to
reduce the cleanliness of conditions but
[SPEAKER_00]: can lead to irrigation issues with
imprecise runoff, poor infiltration and
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigating on the floor causing a great
habitat for potential unwanted organisms
[SPEAKER_00]: to be living.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I fill and not pack the media,
a lot of times people go through and pack
[SPEAKER_00]: in the media and make it really dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep some porosity to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really want to press it all down
and squeeze out all these air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure where growers think all the media
is going to escape to but packing media
[SPEAKER_00]: will reduce air infiltration and make it
harder for the roots to breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind the roots like us need to
exchange oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our roots respire just like you do so
suffocating them is not advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like to squeeze out all
that moisture and all that kind of air
[SPEAKER_00]: pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also place the cutting end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pack it in very lightly but keep
in mind the whole point is to have some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of air in that container in that
media to allow the roots to breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
