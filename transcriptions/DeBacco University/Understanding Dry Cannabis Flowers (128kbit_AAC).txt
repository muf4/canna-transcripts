[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to learn more about dry
flower cannabis, this Tobacco University
[SPEAKER_00]: video is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's go over understanding dry
cannabis flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, I want to thank CT Pharma here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Special thanks for making their
information, analytical reports,
[SPEAKER_00]: product labels, and information publicly
available online.
[SPEAKER_00]: The description is provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll give you some insight into dry
flower cannabis and also kind of what an
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical report, an example of one is so
you can be an informed consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at just the general description
of dry flower products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, dry flower cannabis is looking at
large clusters of dense plant material
[SPEAKER_00]: filled with numerous medical benefits,
mainly green, but dependent on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar can be filled with color hues of
purple and orange as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't think that it always has to be
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be a lot of anthocyanins will be
associated with a purple coloration that
[SPEAKER_00]: you may see.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different cultivars,
all with individual names, different
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid percentages and unique terpene
profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just don't get locked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one particular image that you
need to find to show good dry flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the description of dry flower
just in general is basically the flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested from the best, I put that in
quotes, part of the plant and is
[SPEAKER_00]: handpicked based on quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should come with a certificate of
analysis and a label on the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does not come with one, you should
be sure to definitely request one and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see an example of one in this
lecture series.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example will be provided here later
that you can go through and research.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least this one was provided at the
current point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind there is dry flower
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hundreds of different cultivars,
all with different terpene profiles with
[SPEAKER_00]: different effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Main groups are your sativas, your
indicas, your hybrids, but there's also
[SPEAKER_00]: technically your auto flowers or
ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prices can range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, don't get locked in any one
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of options and that's a
good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabinoid concentrations range from
10% up towards a 35% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and CBD mixes are also available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this just shows you down here some of
the morphology of the leaves of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the uses for dry flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's one of the most popular choices
at dispensaries as it's easy to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoke vaporized for access to medical
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very quickly and easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Effects could be felt within seconds to
minutes after consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also offers easy storage since it
can be kept at room temperature and is a
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly stable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example of a certificate of
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is just showing you looking
at the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here looking at their certificate of
analysis, we can see there's microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters testing, heavy metal testing,
mycotoxin testing, pesticide testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can see a pass on all these.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also gives the results, recommended
limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all good information you should
be getting with any flower you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, you're looking at terpenes
and cannabinoids also expressed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind, while most people will
go to this, we also have to be mindful
[SPEAKER_00]: with that dry flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be mindful of microbial
analysis, heavy metals, mycotoxins,
[SPEAKER_00]: and pesticides as well as the terpenes and
cannabinoids we might be interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the label look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, give you some of that summary there
of some of the components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that they do give the general
quick summary of past all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mycotoxins, heavy metals, microbiological,
and chemical residue testing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even beyond the label, you have the
right as a consumer to go back and ask for
[SPEAKER_00]: a certificate of analysis here to confirm
that and make sure the lot numbers match
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this provides you just a little bit
more information about dry flower so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can be an informed consumer.
Thank you.
