[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, gonna go over some Punnett square
basics here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've talked about these, they're the
simple squares here, so it'd be a
[SPEAKER_00]: mono-hybrid cross, that's what we're gonna
focus on right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, Punnett squares,
consider Mendel's cross, a purple flowered
[SPEAKER_00]: with white flowered pea plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peas can represent dominant allele,
as we're saying for purple flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and little pea, or lowercase peas,
represent white flowers, or the recessive
[SPEAKER_00]: allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using these conversions to the above cross
symbolize big P, big P, homozygous
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant with homozygous dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Punnett square is a grid structure that
enables the calculations of the result
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possible gametes are listed along two
opposite sides, and the genotype of
[SPEAKER_00]: offsprings are represented by the cells in
the squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: The frequency of these genotypes in the
offspring is caused by probability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our square.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this is our Punnett square,
and that's where it gets its name from,
[SPEAKER_00]: the square.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna put our gametes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are, as a result, we cross a
homozygous dominant with a homozygous
[SPEAKER_00]: recessive, meaning our possible gametes
from that resulting offspring are
[SPEAKER_00]: heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: One big P with one little P, one big P
with one little P. So here's our dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: recessive allele, it's a dominant
recessive allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can see in the previous ones,
to flip that for a second, sometimes the
[SPEAKER_00]: male goes on top and the female on the
side here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, because they're both
heterozygous, we don't have to distinguish
[SPEAKER_00]: which one's which.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all we're gonna simply do is carry
these down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this would look like is our little
P comes down here, and this little P comes
[SPEAKER_00]: over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be homozygous recessive,
two little Ps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we repeat that from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our big P would come down here,
and our little P would come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This offspring would be heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd also do the same thing here,
big P, little P would be heterozygous,
[SPEAKER_00]: and here would be homozygous dominant
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how we go through and do a
Punnett square.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply carry the offsprings through,
and again, gametes, you need one from mom,
[SPEAKER_00]: one from dad, and resulting in our diploid
organism here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, how that looks on the large
scale here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, big B is gonna represent
purple, and little B is white.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is that same cross, just a little
bit more of a representative here for the
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype and also providing with the
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see while these three differ in
genotype, the phenotype, what they look
[SPEAKER_00]: like, would be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And evident here, Mendel's flower color is
a Punnett square.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our two dominant alleles,
two recessive, resulting in our
[SPEAKER_00]: heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take those heterozygous, we cross those
together, and that's where the white one
[SPEAKER_00]: comes back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take these heterozygous,
I'm sorry, homozygous dominant and
[SPEAKER_00]: homozygous recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're generating all these offspring,
100% of the offspring may be purple,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're also 100% genotypically our
heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take these offspring, we cross those
together, and that's where the homozygous
[SPEAKER_00]: recessive comes back, and in 25% of the
cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we're looking at the dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, it's hard to tell,
and we can't tell based on looks,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's homozygous dominant or
heterozygous, because that dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: allele, we only need one copy for it to be
evident or seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's called a test cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we take a brown colored
mouse, can be homozygous or heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't tell by simply looking at the
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: One can tell from results of the cross
between the test mouse with the homozygous
[SPEAKER_00]: recessive mouse, and that's what we have
pictured here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the white mouse represents
homozygous recessive, two little a's,
[SPEAKER_00]: two little a's.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we cross our brown mouse with our
white mouse, if all the offspring are
[SPEAKER_00]: brown, we know that that original mouse,
that parent mouse here, was homozygous
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant, because that is passed its
traits onto all the offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, if it was heterozygous, that
recessive allele's gonna match up with
[SPEAKER_00]: this recessive allele, and as a result,
we're gonna get 50% of the offspring here
[SPEAKER_00]: that will be homozygous recessive,
resulting, and we know now, the genotype
[SPEAKER_00]: of that mouse to be heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this test cross is testing whether or
not the organism, in this case the mouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: representing the dominant trait,
is genotypically heterozygous or
[SPEAKER_00]: homozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that same example here with our
yellow pods.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, to be heterozygous,
we see those recessive alleles being
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed in some of the offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So opponent squares show a typical test
cross with two potential outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The individual in question may be either
homozygous, in which half the offspring
[SPEAKER_00]: will be heterozygous, and half will be
homozygous recessive, or homozygous
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant, in which all of the offspring
would be heterozygous, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: represented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if it was homozygous dominant,
all the offspring will have that one
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant allele, and they'll also have
that same color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, if it was heterozygous to begin
with, we'll notice that the recessive
[SPEAKER_00]: allele is shown phenotypically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that gives you a quick look and
basic understanding of opponent squares
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can build from in future lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
