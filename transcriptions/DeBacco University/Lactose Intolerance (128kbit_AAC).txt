[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, here I'm gonna go over lactose
intolerance and the production of
[SPEAKER_00]: lactose-free milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lactose naturally occurs in cow's milk
and it's found in many milk and
[SPEAKER_00]: milk-related products here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a disaccharide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need an enzyme to be able to break
down lactose in our bodies to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: use it for energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people actually have problems with
the digestion of milk and milk products.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is if they do drink a glass of milk
or consume lactose and have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: unpleasant side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across the world, there are certain
regions that have higher chances of having
[SPEAKER_00]: this lactose intolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worldwide, more than 80% of adults cannot
digest milk, sugar, or the lactose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this condition is called lactose
intolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's inability to have the enzyme to
break down lactose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that represented here on the
world map with the darker colors being a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, about 80% of adults worldwide
do not produce lactase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lactase, the last three letters being
A-S-E, that suffix ace tends to refer to
[SPEAKER_00]: an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, this is the enzyme lactase,
which would break down lactose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see these darker regions again here
are where the higher odds of being lactose
[SPEAKER_00]: intolerant are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these lighter greens are reduced odds
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of gives you an idea what
the molecule kind of looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say the enzyme here, lactase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lactose intolerant adults begin their
lives drinking milk from a bottle or
[SPEAKER_00]: breastfeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this allows them to digest it
completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early on in life, babies produce this
enzyme lactase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's pictured right here in
their small intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This end in breaks down lactose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, ace for last suffix breaks down
lactose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, if we look at babies,
babies are lactose tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as humans, we start our lives as
lactose tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lactase is a pair of molecules that we
need to break apart here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the enzyme lactase will snip the
disaccharide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disaccharide meaning two sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see two sugars located right here of
lactose into two simple sugars or
[SPEAKER_00]: monosaccharides here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Galactose and galactose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And glucose here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see them being broken apart here
with the lactase enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see water here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lactose tolerant individuals produce
lactase per life.
[SPEAKER_00]: For them, eating and consuming milk is
perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people enjoy milk chocolate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perfectly fine experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, for those of lactose intolerant,
how the body reacts to not being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: break down this disaccharide, you see a
lot of negatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloated
feelings, and stomach cramps.
[SPEAKER_00]: To help people that are lactose
intolerant, the undigested lactose in the
[SPEAKER_00]: small and large intestine is what causes
the discomforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, we have ways to kind of
combat this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lactase tablets, which can be
taken with lactose-containing meals to
[SPEAKER_00]: help break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of consuming the enzyme that
your body doesn't naturally produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lactose-free milk products are produced by
breaking down lactose using lactase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's supplementing that beforehand,
before the product comes to the person
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, there's sour milk products,
where the lactose is converted to lactic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid using microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the ways we can help people that
are lactose intolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a market for lactose-free products
that's on the rise, such as ice creams,
[SPEAKER_00]: yogurts, and puddings, cheeses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's increasing demand for this because
of the high percentage of people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: lactose intolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an increasing range of options
because of the different mechanisms we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to reduce the presence of lactose in
certain products.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those is large-scale industrial
production of lactose-free milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have all these beads in this
beaker, and what happens is we can produce
[SPEAKER_00]: lactase enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it's expensive, it can be
manufactured by microorganisms and then
[SPEAKER_00]: purified from these microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we can coat these small beads here
with the lactase enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here we can run milk through this and
be a large column.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can run milk continuously plump
through this, and because enzymes are not
[SPEAKER_00]: consumed and used up, they will go through
and break down the lactose with the
[SPEAKER_00]: lactase enzymes, and this will result in
the end product being a lactose-free milk
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no residual lactase in the milk,
and the enzyme can be reused frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by using this lactase enzyme,
kind of artificially creating it and
[SPEAKER_00]: running milk products through it,
we can take our lactase enzyme that's
[SPEAKER_00]: coated here and break down the lactose so
that people that lack the lactase enzyme
[SPEAKER_00]: can consume milk in related products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that gives you just a little
bit of a background if you know someone or
[SPEAKER_00]: even yourself is lactose intolerant.
