[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to be looking at water
absorption in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we water plants, we just assume
they absorb the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may think it's kind of like a sponge
here absorbing the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit more complicated than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to go over a couple key
aspects of how plants absorb water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one here, the main site of
water absorption is the fine root here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a key component there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fine root here is because this is
where there's a lot of surface area to
[SPEAKER_00]: volume, a lot of contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: These, not only the roots, but the fine
root here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the major site of water
absorption occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once it gets through these very fine
hair-like structures, it can enter either
[SPEAKER_00]: an apoplastic or cymplastic root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that means is the apoplastic root
is through the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that here and we see that down
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the cymplastic root,
which is through the cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, regardless of the way that the
water initially enters, it's all going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be kind of funneled to and translated to
these vast vascular bundles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see kind of a microscopic view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these vascular bundles are ultimately
going to transport the water to the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Investigating these vascular bundles in a
little bit more detail, we see there's two
[SPEAKER_00]: main types.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's what we call xylem and what we
call phloem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the xylem is transporting mainly water
and some ions up the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the xylem goes from the roots upward to
the shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the roots to like the stems or the
leaves in that kind of one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phloem though moves carbohydrates,
the byproduct of photosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it moves those carbohydrates up and
down the plant from source cells to sink
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is source cells are
like the leaves that are first making
[SPEAKER_00]: those sugar molecules and they're being
transported to sink cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those sink cells could be actually
developing roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be the flower buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a growing part of the plant
that needs a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what the phloem is doing up and
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from the site of production,
to wherever it needs to be transported to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you don't have to go look in great
detail, but the vascular bundles,
[SPEAKER_00]: D, is the xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're a little bit larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're almost, consider them almost like
straws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And E is the phloem fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see the E because there's
moving up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's transporting the source to sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot of smaller cells here because
they're involved a lot more of the active
[SPEAKER_00]: transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Xylem just moving kind of that bulk water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think of it like pipes moving
through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's moving the bulk of the water from
the roots to the shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that helps kind of illustrate
a little bit the examples here of water
[SPEAKER_00]: absorption plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
