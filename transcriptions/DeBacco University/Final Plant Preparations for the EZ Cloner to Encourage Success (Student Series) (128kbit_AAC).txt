[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this tobacco university student
series video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at final plant
preparations for the EZ Cloner to
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are a couple key things you need
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This video will walk you through those
steps, but hopefully you've got everything
[SPEAKER_00]: taken care of as far as mechanics go,
harvested your plants, and now this will
[SPEAKER_00]: help you increase the odds of rooting
success for your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're going to take the clones that
we just cut from the field, pick one out
[SPEAKER_01]: from the water, and we got to prepare it
to go into the cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you can see, this one's a little
tall for our operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want the top getting burnt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to cut it down to a better
size to fit our cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to choose to cut it from the
next node up, which is right about here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just discard the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next, I'm going to get the foam collar
ready to go about an inch up the branch
[SPEAKER_01]: from the bottom of the branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be sure to be careful when putting it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to break the branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're going to take your clone next
rooting solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dip the bottom in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will allow for the roots to callus
quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it can be moved into its new home and
start growing again.
[SPEAKER_01]: For this plant specifically, we kind of
have a lot going on down at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to choose to take one of
these branches off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, based on the damage that this one
has, it has some looks like bug damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like a bug went in and ate that a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to take that leaf off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as if you're taking a clone,
just try to get as close to the branch as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible and snip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that we have a little bit more area to
work with, we could take the foam collar
[SPEAKER_01]: and try to give it as much space on the
bottom as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to go all the way up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next, I'm going to take our clone next
rooting solution and dip the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: This allows for the rooting on the bottom
to begin callusing quicker than it would
[SPEAKER_01]: without it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm going to place the clone into
its new house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you may be wondering how this is
efficient considering that it's bending
[SPEAKER_01]: over this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But luckily, after it's spent some time in
the cloner due to tropism, it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: start looking back up towards the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's leaning is not something that we
have to worry about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you can see, we've reached the final
step of setting up our cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've put every single one of our clones
that we found outside into the cloner,
[SPEAKER_01]: adjusted them accordingly by cutting them
a little bit, adding clone X to the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can see that they're looking a
little sad, a little droopy, but it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: to worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just because they were just moved
from an outside environment to a sterile
[SPEAKER_01]: inside environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a big change for them,
especially since they're no longer on the
[SPEAKER_01]: mother plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretty much left to fend for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you see over the next night morning,
even the next day that they're seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: seeming a little droopy, that's completely
normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give them a little bit of time,
make sure the nutrients and conductivity
[SPEAKER_01]: are where they're supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you should be also set.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we're going to do.
