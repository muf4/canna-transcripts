[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at gunshot residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you may not think, initial fire,
bullets fired, how much residue is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually exposed around the gun,
but this kind of freeze frame high-speed
[SPEAKER_00]: shot shows the bullet in motion,
shows the fire still coming out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: barrel, and does show the residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind this is a revolver here,
so there can be a little bit more because
[SPEAKER_00]: we have that firing chamber curve right in
the cylinder here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gunshot residue, a lot of times
abbreviated GSR, is a mixture of materials
[SPEAKER_00]: that originate from the firing of a gun,
and it's residue that is deposited on the
[SPEAKER_00]: hands and clothes of someone who
discharges the firearm, and really
[SPEAKER_00]: anything nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Residue can be found on both the firearm
and the individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this again shows another revolver,
kind of shows the angle of projection of
[SPEAKER_00]: that residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the bullet, again caught right
in motion right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives you a good idea of just where
this may be deposited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now gunshot residue, is principally
composed of burnt and unburnt particles
[SPEAKER_00]: from the explosive primer and the
propellant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the possibility of fragments
of the bullet cartridge case and the
[SPEAKER_00]: firearm present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just to say just the
propellant that we see here with the
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could also be a chance that there
could be some of that cartridge case,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the actual bullet component.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are other things to be mindful of
when you're evaluating a scene for gunshot
[SPEAKER_00]: residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the collection of said gunshot residue
the process in general, we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: investigators should use gloves to limit
potential contamination of the scene,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we are looking at something that
is very fine and is found in very small
[SPEAKER_00]: quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Investigators should test the clothing and
skin of people for gunshot residue to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine if they were near the gun when
it was discharged.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you saw with those images, you can see
here, it's not just around the gun,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is some expansion of that,
at least near the site of that initial
[SPEAKER_00]: explosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gunshot residue can travel about over
three to five feet from the gun or about
[SPEAKER_00]: one to one and a half meters away from the
gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind at those kind of ranges
of that, only very few trace particles
[SPEAKER_00]: might be present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gonna be very hard to find those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's important to try to
pinpoint where the gun was actually fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in that gunshot residue, and if you go
through and you go bring it into a lab and
[SPEAKER_00]: analyze it, we're gonna be looking for
elements such as barium, antimony,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are typically found at high levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanna use a probable microscope,
in this case a scanning electron
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope can help kind of look for that
residue that might be present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also a chemical test to
determine what elements might be present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And making the match, well, if the
ammunition used was specifically tagged in
[SPEAKER_00]: some way with special elements,
it's possible to know the cartridge used
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce the gunshot residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using scanning electron microscopes or a
dispersive X-ray spectrometry can also
[SPEAKER_00]: help or aid in this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole goal of going through this
process is to match the bullet to the gun
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to try to determine or start
developing links of what occurred at the
[SPEAKER_00]: crime scene to what materials were used at
the crime scene.
