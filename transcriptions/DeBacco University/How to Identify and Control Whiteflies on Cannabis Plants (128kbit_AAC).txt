[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over how to identify and
[SPEAKER_00]: control whiteflies if you identify them on
your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of a unique look here at some
whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This video is going to focus on how to
identify them, control them on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the description of
whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, whiteflies are a piercing and
sucking insect that feed on the plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: sap.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can develop quickly in warm weather
and they can mass multiply.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to inspect the underside of the
leaves for the actual insects,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also inspect for the small
dots, which are the eggs, which will show
[SPEAKER_00]: just the pressure that is to come for
whiteflies on your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, identification of whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, luckily, whiteflies are large and
typically easy to spot with regular
[SPEAKER_00]: inspections.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not super small like some other
insects are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feed on young plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can cause leaf curling and plant
distortion because they're just basically
[SPEAKER_00]: piercing and sucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to cause that plant to take
on that kind of crinkled look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another reason for concern is the
potential for viral transmission via
[SPEAKER_00]: whiteflies being the virus vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of general feeding, you can see that
kind of stippling on the leaves here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flipping this over would likely reveal
whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you go about managing
whiteflies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, whiteflies can quickly develop a
resistance to pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this should only be used if there's an
initial large population to kind of reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: or knock down their numbers before
implementing another method of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that other method of control should
be a biological control, such as the
[SPEAKER_00]: pirate bugs in green lacewings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you see a pirate bug feeding on the
larvae of whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be in effective control,
at least if they're established early when
[SPEAKER_00]: populations are small.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why if you have a large population,
you can catch it early knocking that down
[SPEAKER_00]: with pesticides potential option,
but really utilizing these beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: insects is what's advised because it
requires no chemical residue or
[SPEAKER_00]: applications to your actual cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
