[SPEAKER_00]: If you're considering cocoa coir for your
indoor plant production, hopefully you
[SPEAKER_00]: tune into this video to gain some helpful
information provided by Tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into cocoa coir for
indoor cannabis plant production here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cocoa for Coconuts, we're looking here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa coir is made up of the husk of the
coconut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see right here, and there's also
other products from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's produced primarily in Sri Lanka,
Philippines, Indonesia, Mexico,
[SPEAKER_00]: and parts of the Caribbean and South
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very popular growing substrate,
and it was once considered a waste product
[SPEAKER_00]: due to, in part, its very slow
decomposition rate, which takes about 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, keep in mind, it can be a little
bit of a variable product because it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: natural product, so one batch to another
may have some degree of variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: While similar, there is a natural product,
so that variation is to be expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind, and come back
when companies are getting better and
[SPEAKER_00]: decreasing the amount of variability you
get from one batch to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three types kind of presented
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the Cocoa Pith, or P, and this
looks like peat moss retains water very
[SPEAKER_00]: well to the point that growers need to
monitor conditions to avoid root rots,
[SPEAKER_00]: so keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: For using cocoa fibers, these are not very
absorbent, but do allow for great aeration
[SPEAKER_00]: of the root zone, but will break down over
time, reducing the amount of aeration if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're reusing that particular substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Cocoa Chips, that does retain
water, but still maintains porosity,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this provides the best of Cocoa Pith
and fibers, kind of like the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: in-between role.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the properties, just in general,
if you want really the kind of scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: properties, fiber lengths, average tensile
strength, specific gravity, elongation
[SPEAKER_00]: percentages, all of that's provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, Cocoa Quar can hold water
while still allowing the roots to have
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficient aeration, hold their properties
for longer than standard soilless options
[SPEAKER_00]: that are available, the peach does tend to
favor the 5.2 to 6.8 range, so keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this does lack plant available
nutrients, but is still preferred by many
[SPEAKER_00]: growers because of its main property that
is simply inert, doesn't really react with
[SPEAKER_00]: very many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's popular because of that
aeration to the roots, minimal pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as a great benefit, reduced pest
pressure in the initial substance using it
[SPEAKER_00]: right out of the bag, or in this case,
using it in a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're purchasing this particular
product, this Coconut Quar, as you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: here as just an example, you want to look
to see if the material has been triple
[SPEAKER_00]: washed to limit the chance of the
substrate containing high salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, having an included SDS sheet,
which is the safety data sheet,
[SPEAKER_00]: helps provide information about the
product and also shows a high level of
[SPEAKER_00]: commitment by the company that they stand
behind their product and have gotten it
[SPEAKER_00]: tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that it has more multiple rinse
cycles as salt content is possible with
[SPEAKER_00]: this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also to ensure pathogen free
environment, there can be chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments applied, so reviewing the SDS
sheet can be very important to let you
[SPEAKER_00]: know how that particular company chose to
treat that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This product does aggressively hold
calcium, magnesium and iron, so be sure to
[SPEAKER_00]: have these fertilizers on hand if you're
going to be using this as a substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's often part of a blend,
so some growers grow in like a pure form,
[SPEAKER_00]: others use it as a blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is commonly mixed with potting soil or
also perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers typically do a 50-50 mix of soil
or soilless mixes with the Cocoa to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of get the benefit of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see here, varying recipes,
some people can grow it straight,
[SPEAKER_00]: some people have, you know, the different
combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be aware with every blend you're
using, it's going to have slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: different properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be aware to be able to handle those
properties in your growing operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you're using Cocoa, it's kind of
the last statement, hopefully you've made
[SPEAKER_00]: it to the end here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers should be feeding plants
frequently, typically daily or at least
[SPEAKER_00]: every other day to avoid nutrient
deficiencies in this media, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: in container growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to overwater this, so it offers
a great margin for error for newer
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, and make sure you have a calcium,
magnesium product on hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great that it also has a little
bit of iron as well, so great product to
[SPEAKER_00]: have on hand if you're using Cocoa coir
because those fibers really do hold onto
[SPEAKER_00]: those calcium, those magnesium molecules
greater than what the plant roots can take
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So self-loathing with this product will
ensure your plants avoid any chance of a
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
