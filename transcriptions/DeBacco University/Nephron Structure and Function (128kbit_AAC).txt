[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to look at the
distinctive structure and function of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nephron, which is located in the kidney.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are many, over a million,
nephrons per each kidney, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: important for the filtration of blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at that blood in the kidney,
well, how's it going through?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have this intense network of
capillaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have our veins and our arteries
here surrounding our nephron.
[SPEAKER_00]: These nephrons here are allowing a lot of
nutrients and water and ions to be
[SPEAKER_00]: exchanged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we see so many of these
blood vessels surrounding each one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each nephron has this very distinctive
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to go over the details of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the nephrons, they're the
functioning units of the kidney.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cleanse the blood and balance the
constitutes for circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're constantly filtering out the
blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take simple filtrate of blood and
modify it ultimately into forming urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, there's 1.3 million
nephrons per each kidney that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that blood flow, we have these intense
capillary beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our arteries and our veins going
through our venules.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see all these little blood vessels
surrounding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of looks like a bunch of tubes
kind of folding on one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important because we have a lot of
exchanges occurring at these distinctive
[SPEAKER_00]: sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, we're producing urine at the
very end, and that will be excreted from
[SPEAKER_00]: the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: The anatomy of the nephron here,
giving a nice quick summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The glomerulus filters small solids from
the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: That then leads to the proximal convoluted
tubule, the PCT, where ions can be
[SPEAKER_00]: reabsorbed, water can be reabsorbed,
and also nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Toxins will be removed, and we'll adjust
the filtrate pH to maintain our proper
[SPEAKER_00]: homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, we see it kind of bends
around the corner, comes around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the descending loop of hemline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aquaporins allow water to pass from the
filtrate into the interstitial fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, we do 180 degree hairpin turn
coming back up the ascending loop,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're reabsorbing sodium ions and
chloride ions from the filtrate to the
[SPEAKER_00]: interstitial fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's leading to the distal tubule,
which is selectively secreting and
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbing different ions to maintain blood
pH and electrode balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of that homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know if we're secreting or
absorbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the constraints or the
stresses on the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, it leads to the collecting
duct, which reabsorbs solutes in water to
[SPEAKER_00]: form the filtrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the physiology of the nephron are
seeing this arterioles, and we see these
[SPEAKER_00]: veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this filtration that's occurring in
the Bowman's capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have various capillaries located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have filtration, reabsorption,
secretion, ultimately excretion in the
[SPEAKER_00]: form of urine in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you a little bit of an idea of
the complexity of what's going on with
[SPEAKER_00]: each nephron, and we notice that there's
different ions that's occurring here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these ions are either coming in,
they could be going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is helping the body maintain
homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these nephrons need to be in direct
contact with the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this might seem a little complex
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will admit, it's not the easiest to
follow, at least initially, but I provide
[SPEAKER_00]: this with you at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to draw your attention to at
this point is we have these distinctive
[SPEAKER_00]: sections here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The filtration step, we have the PCT,
the proximal catalytic tubule,
[SPEAKER_00]: the penlay, the distal, and the collecting
duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go over these each in
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: An image that's probably a little less
scary here, showing you the same region
[SPEAKER_00]: and stretching out that nephron a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have that filtration, that selective
reabsorption, the osmoregulation and salt
[SPEAKER_00]: gradient, selective reabsorption,
and then water retention at the very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is a little stretched out to
kind of give you the idea of what it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is much more condensed because you're
trying to fit 1.3 million in each.
Kidney.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the glomerulus,
the only place where actually filtration
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blood pressure is used to push plasma
through the capillary walls to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bowman's capsule here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our actual point of filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The glomerulus is in red and the Bowman's
capsule here is in tan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're forcing that blood plasma across,
causing that kind of physical type of
[SPEAKER_00]: filtration to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: That then leads to the PCT, or proximal
catalytic tubule, where our nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: our salts, some vitamins, and water can be
moved out of the tubule through active
[SPEAKER_00]: transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this does require energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, for water, we're not using that
through active transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: That occurs by osmosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also reabsorb substances,
sodiums, nutrients, urea, lipid soluble
[SPEAKER_00]: silates, and small proteins in our
proximal tubule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, we have our loop of Henle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just remember, there's two parts to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It consists of both a descending,
which is important for water flow,
[SPEAKER_00]: and an ascending, which is a transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a transfer loop of ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our sodium and chloride ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tissues around the loop of Henle is salty
from active transport and diffusion of
[SPEAKER_00]: these chloride ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The salty conditions allow water to
diffuse out of the loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're creating that water and that
ions, and through the process of osmosis
[SPEAKER_00]: and regulation, this is how we're having
that water move across.
[SPEAKER_00]: Active transport is moving the ions,
and osmosis is moving the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on to the distal tubule here,
it selectively secretes or absorbs ions to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain blood pH in the electrolyte
balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is that homeostasis coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can kind of absorb or secrete them,
depending what the body needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Active transport is used to move these
nutrients out of the concentrated urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're slowly getting very close to
producing our end product, which is urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some ions, drugs, and toxins are actively
pumped into the tubule for excretion out
[SPEAKER_00]: the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see this active transport pictured
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's requiring ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, that collecting duct,
more water leaves the tubule by osmosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: since the tube is surrounded by salty
tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that salty tissue is driving that
moving water, and that water is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: move in that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So urea also leaves by diffusion,
but it may be cycled through the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, urea is less toxic than ammonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here's that kind of simple
structure of the nephron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the Bozeman's castle,
the proximal tubule, the loop of Henle,
[SPEAKER_00]: the distal tubule, and the collecting
duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, to end with, that little bit more
complex image that hopefully you can kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of get an appreciation for all the
different things occurring at the
[SPEAKER_00]: different steps and where things might be
moving in or moving out to help the body
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain homeostasis and ultimately
produce urine and concentrate waste
[SPEAKER_00]: products so they'll be excreted from the
body.
