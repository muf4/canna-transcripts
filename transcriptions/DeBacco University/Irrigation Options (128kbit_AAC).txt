[SPEAKER_00]: So while growers know it's important to
irrigate their crops, they might not
[SPEAKER_00]: realize the options that do exist to water
their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to go over just a couple of
those here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, irrigation options.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there are many options here to
choose from, the goal is to efficiently
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver water to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's common for all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best fit may depend on the exact
operation, whether it's field grown or
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor grown or container grown or what
type of media you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here the athletic field here
using pop-up sprinklers, kind of as
[SPEAKER_00]: overhead irrigations is the best for this
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others, we have hand watering against the
version of overhead or drip irrigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: are all options worth considering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, hand watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only good for small operations,
and even in this situation, it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: not advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very time consuming and not very
efficient process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should only be used to supplement other
methods to compensate for potential dry
[SPEAKER_00]: spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it shouldn't be the main source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be kind of a supplement to one
of the other main sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply because it's just so time consuming
and really not offering that much benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plants, especially in areas where
you have very even conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overhead irrigation, outdoor applications
only, would be advised for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to use this in an indoor,
especially running lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a very negative effect there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should still be used sparingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why overhead should be used
sparingly is it wets the leaves and buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is why it's not a good option.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can increase mold that could occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can get all bad things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you must run it early in the morning
when plants are typically covered in
[SPEAKER_00]: morning dew anyway, so you're not kind of
re-wetting the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already kind of getting leaves and
flowers that might be wet already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of just re-wetting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not running it at a time that
you're kind of re-inducing more moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: than would be there normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's micro sprinklers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are kind of like an overhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hard to get the size
orientation, but these are smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a specific type of that overhead
irrigation, and they're best utilized to
[SPEAKER_00]: cover areas with low volumes of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's inverted for overhead,
and there's vertical or pop-ups as we see
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and they spin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they act in a very similar manner to
overhead irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also fogging equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically this is not considered a
source of irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think you're using a fogger for
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using that more for cooling because
it's producing literally this very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very fine mist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see in the outdoor operation here
for kind of demonstration purposes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they can be used in indoor operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that the lights hanging here,
this aquafog placed right in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is applied, is intended for cooling
or humidity regulation, not to hydrate the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though you are using water,
don't consider this as a form of
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to wet the leaf surface,
but not to the point of runoff if we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at a true fogging system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will say they're using the
fogging system and kind of like overuse it
[SPEAKER_00]: and wet the leaves of the plants and get
it to run off and kind of use it as a form
[SPEAKER_00]: of irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a true fogging system,
not very efficient for that purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better for cooling and humidity
regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very efficient way to deliver
water and nutrients as the water will,
[SPEAKER_00]: one drip at a time, reach the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see kind of this long run
here of how that drip irrigation operates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a low volume, low pressure system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does require an initial investment in
all this material, but once invested,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can last for several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be easily automated with
timers and fertilizer injectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: For cannabis, there's these coming in very
popularly, these irrigation rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're typically used as a modified drip
irrigation system for even watering of
[SPEAKER_00]: containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be fabric pots or plastic
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's specifically marketed for cannabis
production because of typically the high
[SPEAKER_00]: demand of water for the plant and also the
ability to cover each individual plant
[SPEAKER_00]: very efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, if you are using containers,
for indoor operations in particular,
[SPEAKER_00]: all containers need to have a way to catch
the extra water, some sort of basin below
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These catch pans are simple drains
necessary to prevent standing water from
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting and sitting in the bottom of
the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Need a way for that moisture to go to,
or that water to go to, especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're flushing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a way to keep an eye on to make
sure that you are getting sufficient water
[SPEAKER_00]: in the chosen media that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, if you are using storage tanks as
part of your irrigation system,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's important to monitor and clean this
tanks on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too often if they're sitting in place,
people just kind of fill them and use
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't worry about, you know,
any sort of contaminants, but especially
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're outdoors, they can build up
algae potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're mobile like this within sealed,
still keep an eye, look and inspect it to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure there's nothing growing there
you don't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be difficult to clean tanks that if
they're used for gravity systems that are
[SPEAKER_00]: high on a tower, but still worth the extra
quick time to go check to make sure they
[SPEAKER_00]: are clean so you don't ruin an entire crop
due to a dirty tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the lack of the grower,
taking just a couple seconds to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is dirty, taking the time then to
spend to clean that to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_00]: water they're irrigating their plants with
is as clean and as pure as possible to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the chance of contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
