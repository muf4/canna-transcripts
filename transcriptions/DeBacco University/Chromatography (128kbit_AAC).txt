[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to be looking at
chromatography, and this is an example
[SPEAKER_00]: shown here of paper chromatography,
but a lot of the same basic components
[SPEAKER_00]: will apply to different types and forms of
chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I'll provide a definition of
chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a separation technique based on
different interactions or affinities of
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds with two phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: A mobile phase, as the name implies,
it moves in a stationary phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a compound that stays fixed in
place, and that is on a supporting medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: These interactions are usually chemical in
nature, but can also, in some cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: be physical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you typically end up with,
at least in paper chromatography,
[SPEAKER_00]: is what you see kind of right over here is
those kind of bands that occur of
[SPEAKER_00]: different color separations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to get into some of those terms
with a little bit more detail provided,
[SPEAKER_00]: the affinities and natural attraction
force between things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mobile phase is the solvent that flows
through the supporting medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see here's that solvent,
here's that solvent front.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it's traveling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's its furthest point of travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the stationary phase, which is a
layer or coating on the supporting medium
[SPEAKER_00]: that interacts with the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the coating on the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The paper itself is considered the
supporting medium, and that's the solid
[SPEAKER_00]: surface where the stationary phase is
bound to or is coated onto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uses for chromatography is particularly,
it expands beyond forensic science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can analyze components of mixtures
based on known values.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can allow separation of components in
order to isolate one of interest for
[SPEAKER_00]: further study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also used to determine the amount in
a mixture in our components present in a
[SPEAKER_00]: sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be very precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illustration of chromatography in general,
as I mentioned, is kind of mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: components there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have this mixture, you have a mobile
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That mobile phase is going to move up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you have that moving up of the
mobile phase of the solvent, as you can
[SPEAKER_00]: refer back to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our solvent moving up through that
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that solvent that we see here moving up
allows that mixture, or wants to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture, to then be separated into its
individual components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how may this look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we're kind of looking at paper
chromatography, again, as an example,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we have red, blue,
and green.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put that into a container,
and we're going to put a solvent in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That solvent line will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of allows us to put the
colors above that solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is naturally going to want to
wick up through this stationary phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that mobile phase will work its way up
through, and we can see those colors in
[SPEAKER_00]: this example will separate out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the very top here, this is our
solvent front.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can quantify this by measuring to
determine how far these particular colors
[SPEAKER_00]: moved and what signatures or chemical
properties they may have.
