[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over if you
find something that you suspect to be
[SPEAKER_00]: blood at a crime scene, how do you go
about detecting whether blood is present
[SPEAKER_00]: in the evidence that you have found?
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting first with the light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is often the first tool used to
investigate a crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it can cover a large area
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can identify more than just blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bodily fluids can be identified that would
not be visible under normal lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also fingerprints might be able to be
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: These artificial light sources are
typically high-intensity light or UV light
[SPEAKER_00]: are used to help identify this trace
evidence at a scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there are reagent tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are examples of presumptive tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now presumptive tests can only confirm the
presence or absence of a sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of is a positive or negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really tell you much more than
that, but that can still be important.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tests function based on the
properties of hemoglobin in the blood and
[SPEAKER_00]: are often used with some type of chemical
reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tests are resulting in a color
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, you see the negative being
clear, the positive being a purple-pinkish
[SPEAKER_00]: color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Further tests at the crime lab can
determine if it's human blood or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this at least gives the investigator
some initial results.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a blood reagent test,
or phenothaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is typically referred to as a
Castlemire test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces a pink color when it reacts
with hemoglobin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a red substance that we
suspect is blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: While using phenothaline here,
we can see it turns pink.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a clear solution, this is indicating
that it's blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not confirm that it's human blood
or a frog's blood or something else,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this gives an initial step in the
investigation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have blood reagent test examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemostix is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a strip that's been coated with
tetramethylbenzidine, and it will produce
[SPEAKER_00]: a green to bluish-green color with the
presence of hemoglobin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is kind of on the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of gives you that color
indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be another quick way to be able to
determine whether or not the substance
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at is blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also luminol, which is a chemical
that can locate traces of blood,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it's been cleaned or removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Investigators spray the luminol solution
throughout the area that's under
[SPEAKER_00]: investigation, and will look at the
reactions with iron present in the blood,
[SPEAKER_00]: which causes a blue luminescence to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this chemical does react with
other substances, potentially some metals
[SPEAKER_00]: and paints and cleaning products,
and also plant materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this isn't a 100% guarantee,
but it does provide at least some initial
[SPEAKER_00]: steps to try to determine potentially what
you're looking at may be blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use this with caution because this
chemical reaction can destroy the evidence
[SPEAKER_00]: on the crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're overusing this, you can be
potentially harming the original evidence,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can impact the investigation later
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have fluorescent, which is a
chemical similar to luminol, and it has
[SPEAKER_00]: that same kind of fluorescent-like
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also capable of detecting latent,
which just can't be seen, or old blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ideal for fine stains and smears
found throughout the crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the solution has been sprayed onto
the suspected area, UV light and goggles
[SPEAKER_00]: are used to detect any luminescent areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So color will appear as greenish-white if
blood is present.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may also react with many of the same
things that luminol does, including but
[SPEAKER_00]: not limited to copper and bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, use it with caution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the LCV, or the leukocrystal
violet test, and this is a chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: process used to visually enhance blood
that allows for easier photography and
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis from there on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we can see the image where we don't
really see much of a footprint here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but here we spray it with crystal violet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that purple color becomes much
more evident.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot better to photograph and be able to
carry on for further parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the same thing again with a
