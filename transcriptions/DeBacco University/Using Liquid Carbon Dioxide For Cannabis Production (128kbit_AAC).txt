[SPEAKER_00]: So here on Tobacco University,
I'll be describing using liquid carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interested in using a very dense,
very pure form of carbon dioxide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, using liquid might be worth a
consideration, particularly if you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger growing operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So liquid carbon dioxide is similar to
compressed carbon dioxide, at least in the
[SPEAKER_00]: general methods that would be implemented
Liquid bottles are essentially a denser
[SPEAKER_00]: form of compressed carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, unlike compressed carbon dioxide,
liquid carbon dioxide requires
[SPEAKER_00]: refrigeration when being stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically it's found in larger sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a 300 pound, 500 pound,
a 750 pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: They even come in larger sizes than that
for your liquid carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I said, this does require
specialized equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is more required equipment when
using liquid carbon dioxide and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: why it is commonly used for larger
applications where compressed carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide tank would simply be too large and
require too frequent fillings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using liquid, as we can see here,
this is probably your regular for size
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison, 50 pound bottles and see how
large this liquid carbon dioxide tank is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So specialized equipment, but can be
justified for larger growing operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now liquid becomes a gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using liquid carbon dioxide,
it will not be delivered to the plants as
[SPEAKER_00]: a liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it'll be delivered as a gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will be heated and injected via the
gaseous state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that does not mean you can go through
and go through and add a fire extinguisher
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, add the gaseous state in
this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is using a fan help disperse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really recommended in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be much more precisely delivered to plants
and allows for a very consistent results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So same general idea, but in the very
general sense, but not like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So liquid carbon dioxide setup,
what was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would that actually look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here we see there's a safety relief
valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a pressure gauge, a darker colored
ring around the top of the cylinder in
[SPEAKER_00]: case a siphon tube is present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at the actual kind
of cylinder, we're noticing there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: gaseous carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about five to 10 percent of carbon
dioxide by weight is unused because only
[SPEAKER_00]: gas remains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have the liquid carbon dioxide here
at 700 to 800 pounds per square inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at this in general,
very similar to a gaseous state,
[SPEAKER_00]: a compressed bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we saw here, additional equipment
is required and tends to be used in larger
[SPEAKER_00]: sizes for larger operations where simple
compressed bottles would just be too
[SPEAKER_00]: laborious and not as efficient.
