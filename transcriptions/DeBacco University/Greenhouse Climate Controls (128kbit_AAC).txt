[SPEAKER_00]: When we're thinking about greenhouse and
climate controls, we don't want to just
[SPEAKER_00]: think about heating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to just think about cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to think about how heating and
cooling interact along with a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: things associated with efficient
greenhouse production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I included a link down here that gives a
great kind of heating alternatives and
[SPEAKER_00]: some good information for those that are
seeking a little bit more regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now greenhouse climate control,
ventilation is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: For any greenhouse or high-total keeping
air moving through that structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, if you are adding fans,
because you're looking at a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: here, fans are much more efficient at
pulling air, not pushing air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So exhaust fans will typically,
if you walk by one, you get blown by those
[SPEAKER_00]: fans because they're pulling air through
the greenhouse and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not really that great at pushing
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why exhaust fans blow air out,
and this is why you see these are inlets
[SPEAKER_00]: here, screen netting over them to prevent
insects from getting pulled into the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calculating the CFM or cubic feet per
minute needed for both exhaust fans and
[SPEAKER_00]: cheddar size can be calculated via these
online calculators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So provided I found a couple really good
ones, I think, that allow you to plug in
[SPEAKER_00]: different sizes of structures and to be
able to get kind of an idea of what size
[SPEAKER_00]: fan or what size vent you should be adding
to your particular structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now heating systems, there's many
different types of heating systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regional and general combustion fuels have
the potential to generate unwinded gases
[SPEAKER_00]: such as ethylene, which can affect
ripening, and carbon monoxide CO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Propane generates high amounts of
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wood can be easily accessible,
but generates waste in the ash and often
[SPEAKER_00]: requires manual feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oil, easy to get in large quantities,
but the furnace does require maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electric can be reliable and easy to
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't generate wasted or unwanted
byproducts, but can be very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: For cooling systems, a simple thermostat
and exhaust fan can suffice.
[SPEAKER_00]: A key is to have enough intake air,
and that's where the open roof design can
[SPEAKER_00]: help alleviate some of the heat issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air conditioning systems can be installed
to ensure an accurate temperature is
[SPEAKER_00]: reached, but these can also be very
expensive to run and also maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat pumps can be used as swamp coolers
for best suited for small applications and
[SPEAKER_00]: with not a lot of heat to remove.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these swamp coolers work best in areas
with low humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, Arizona in the southwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Misting systems can be employed.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are very simple design.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can offer some degree of cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The droplet size should be considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: A mist system you want really,
really fine particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The finer, it'll act more like a fogging
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the droplets get too large,
this can wet the floor or surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: which may not be wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also leave a lot of heavy moisture
that can increase rot or mold that could
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those large droplets give that algae a
chance to grow, which is just unwanted,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though we do want the cooling
advantage of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irrigation systems there's many different
types, even some are hydroponic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at irrigation systems in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can watering is the most basic,
but is very time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flood and drain of the sea implemented in
this grow tent is suited for bench style
[SPEAKER_00]: operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large style, there's also drip irrigation
where it's evenly dispersing water over a
[SPEAKER_00]: long distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supplemental lighting may not be thought
of as needed, but for a year round
[SPEAKER_00]: production, especially during winter
months, this can be advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: LED lights are showing promise in this
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very efficiently mounted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not consuming a lot of power.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're passively cooled.
[SPEAKER_00]: High pressure sodiums have also been
implemented in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit not quite as efficient as a
true full spectrum LED, but another option
[SPEAKER_00]: to consider for greenhouse production.
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 enrichment, assuming that all of the
growing environment aspects are maximized,
[SPEAKER_00]: only then does CO2 then become a limiting
factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have enough light,
or enough heat, or enough nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: those can all negatively impact plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all those are maxed out and you're
looking for that kind of next step up,
[SPEAKER_00]: well then you can consider CO2 enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is justified in operations looking
for maximum yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: If heat is required, use a CO2 generator
as this can serve a dual purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have the burners going on
generating CO2 from the form of propane in
[SPEAKER_00]: heating the room at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If heat is already kind of an issue,
you can use regular bottle tanks or
[SPEAKER_00]: liquids systems, and these basically
generate no unwanted by-products and
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently elevate CO2 levels in the
ground space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's too much sun in the area,
shade cloth can be implemented to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the sun's intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different percentages of shade
cloth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in a variety of colors,
black being the most common.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we're looking at heat
reduction, black can absorb a lot of heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it is kind of reducing the
amount of sun exposure that the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: under it get.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other reflective netting like
aluminate, which literally looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: little bits of aluminum, very shiny,
can also help produce the shade effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: which not quite is getting as hot because
it's reflecting some more of the heat and
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it's just blocking some of the light
and getting warmer, especially on long
[SPEAKER_00]: summer days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light deprivation, so monitoring and
maintaining proper photo periods for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis can be very important,
and it needs to be regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, we see the same materials
here that on one side they're very dark
[SPEAKER_00]: and black to block out screens to allow
growers to precisely regulate photo
[SPEAKER_00]: periods of their crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other side, it can be white to kind
of this white with black stripes to this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of almost mylar look to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these design or all three of these
designs on the outside help reflect light,
[SPEAKER_00]: but on the inside can be dark on
themselves to help prevent light from
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into the crop, allowing growers to
maximize their crop to either be in the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative or the flowering state,
regardless of the outside conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Data logging is also important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an easy way to track conditions in
the growing environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be used to spot errors and make
corrections to help maximize production.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very small portable units.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also very large, almost weather
station related units that can track a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of factors and data log them on a
very continual basis over the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this climate control, these are a
couple of things that focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: ventilation, heating, cooling,
missing systems, irrigation, supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting, CO2 generators or enrichment,
shade netting, light block, and data
[SPEAKER_00]: logging are all important to help maintain
like you would almost in a car,
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent conditions to maximize plant
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
