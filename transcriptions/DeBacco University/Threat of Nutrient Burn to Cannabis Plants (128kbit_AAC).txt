[SPEAKER_00]: This is something a lot of growers may not
want to admit to, but the threat of
[SPEAKER_00]: burning their plants with over-application
of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tobacco university video is going to
cover just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into the threat of
nutrient burn to cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most growers tend to over-fertilize
their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrient burn is typically a
grower-induced error when they do not
[SPEAKER_00]: properly calculate the nutrients needed by
the plants or think they need a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, growers typically think more
fertilizer can fix a wide range of
[SPEAKER_00]: problems when it actually may cause more
than it would solve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of leaf structure here,
this kind of burning here, is evidence
[SPEAKER_00]: that maybe they over-edited the nutrients
to this small growing plant and caused it
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of to get this kind of crinkled or
stunted look to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you want to avoid nutrient toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So follow manufacturers' recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know the pH values and concentrations of
your nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Favor on the low side and work to higher
concentrations after you see how the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants react.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go through an over-add,
it can be just the same negative effect as
[SPEAKER_00]: if you were to under-add.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a whole lot easier to add a little
bit more than to try to take a little
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you want to be mindful to recognize
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's many of these charts that
exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what certain deficiencies look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll help you ensure you can correct
problems early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give you the confidence that you can
identify something early so that you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get into that chance of reaching those
toxic or excessive levels in a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tobacco University also has more
cannabis-specific videos on recognizing
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to know your fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many fertilizers have a blend of
nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium,
[SPEAKER_00]: NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do not make application for one
nutrient without considering the other
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning, if you calculate the amount of
fertilizer to add for 120 parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million of nitrogen, which if you're
learning how to do that, search Tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: University for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not forget about the phosphorus and
potassium, as this could lead to an
[SPEAKER_00]: over-application of these nutrients if
you're only focusing and calculating for
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you want to be sure you have
specialty fertilizers on hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be a good idea to have some
fertilizers that are nutrient-specific to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure, as a grower, you can dial in a
fertilizer program if there's a deficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is recommended for at least nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And calcium, magnesium should have some
specialty fertilizers on there,
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is typically something very
quick in each to add and something
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants require.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to know fertilizer's
compatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's just some example charts here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some fertilizers can be mixed,
while others have reduced solubility,
[SPEAKER_00]: and others simply are incompatible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test your mix before adding it to your
plants, and consult one of these charts
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead of time so you know you don't waste
your time making an incompatible mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just gives you some of the various
common fertilizers that might be added.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's compatible, what has reduced
solubility, and what is simply
[SPEAKER_00]: incompatible there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be mindful of this before you go
through mixing fertilizers, so you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: do more harm than good to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you mix these two together and
just go through and apply it, you could
[SPEAKER_00]: cause nutrient burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you over-apply it could cause nutrient
burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just ensure that you're giving the
plants what they need, not anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them at the optimum level,
and they'll be at the peak of efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
