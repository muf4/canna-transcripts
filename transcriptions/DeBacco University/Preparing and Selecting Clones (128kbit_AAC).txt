[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we'll look at preparing and
selecting clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the image here was not chosen by
accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these are female silhouettes because
when we're selecting clones, we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be selecting an outstanding female
plant for its high cannabinoid production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who to clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, starting out with easy plants such
as tomatoes, for persinthias to practice
[SPEAKER_00]: on might be a good initial plant to start
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to clone a unique individual
with desirable traits to ensure the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: planting of superior individuals is
obtained.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's why I say start with the
tomatoes or persinthias.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really easy and they can help you
refine your techniques before you go on to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis or other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why you want to select that
unique individual is you want to capture
[SPEAKER_00]: like lightning in a bottle so you can
replicate that one particular unique
[SPEAKER_00]: individual so you can develop a whole crop
of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you clone auto-flowering plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes, but just because you can do it
doesn't mean you should.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to avoid auto-flowering plants,
root alice in particular is the cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: subset since these will produce poor
quality plants due to the natural life
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle not being easily extended into the
cloning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically we're looking at
non-auto-flowering plants being
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous to clone and trying to avoid
the auto-flowering ones, but it is
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideal time for cloning?
[SPEAKER_00]: In actuality, any plant can be cloned at
any stage of growth and development,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are more ideal times to
mechanize production and efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ideal time is when the mother or stock
plant is about at least one month old.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to go much younger than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The school is to ensure that the traits
you want are expressed and provide plant
[SPEAKER_00]: time to produce many branches to allow for
easy cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you clone them too early, you won't
simply get enough offspring off that
[SPEAKER_00]: initial stock or mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preparing mother plants for cloning?
[SPEAKER_00]: A stock plant that has been fed less
nitrogen will help the cuttings produce
[SPEAKER_00]: roots faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overfeeding may produce nice lush growth,
vegetative growth in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: But will increase the time it takes for
that cutting to actually root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, the mother plant should be in the
vegetative stage to reduce rooting time
[SPEAKER_00]: and provide clones that will not
potentially flower early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a mother plant already
flowering, this will cause a delay in
[SPEAKER_00]: production since the cuttings must go kind
of backwards in the vegetative state
[SPEAKER_00]: before they can then re-flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a mother plant at least one
month old in the vegetative state is the
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilizing our mother plant or stock
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to avoid those high nitrogens even
though they do produce those deep green
[SPEAKER_00]: robust look to a plants because canvas can
what's called luxury consume, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: they can take in more than the plant needs
and that nitrogen will result in a delay
[SPEAKER_00]: in the production of roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the root quality might be poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a fine line between too much and
too little nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when in doubt, I suggest you to
underfeed because you can always add a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult to take away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selection tip, when selecting that unique
individual with the arrival states for
[SPEAKER_00]: replication, you want to pick out that one
special plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cloning just an average plant will result
in average offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to multiply a plant that is
unique and can be difficult to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: When looking at an actual plant,
select a stem that is still useful but
[SPEAKER_00]: nearing maturation to help reduce rooting
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I say select that unique individual,
it's very easy in this case to select a
[SPEAKER_00]: unique individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here we have this field of sunflowers
might be a little more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be a slightly taller plant,
be one producing more petals, could be one
[SPEAKER_00]: that flowers earlier instead of later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's different nuances you want to
take into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a larger population, you're more
likely to find one unique individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not always as clear cut as this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason why you want to select that
one individual is you're going to grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of these plants and it's just
average.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that maybe you can get from other
means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant material that is not ideal for
clones, well older plant material will be
[SPEAKER_00]: slow to root and may have poor overall
root production and should not be the
[SPEAKER_00]: first go-to material.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's all that you have, by all means
use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very young material may also not be able
to support itself through the stressful
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of want that nice in between,
not the too young, not the too old,
[SPEAKER_00]: to allow for increased odds of success in
your clones taking root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Storing clones, in general I don't
recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you're transporting plant
material, taking fresh cutting should be
[SPEAKER_00]: placed in a plastic bag that's been like
misted with water and placed about 40
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees if you're trying to hold them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rooting gel can be applied when you first
take them, but that can get very messy in
[SPEAKER_00]: a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take the cuttings, apply the
rooting hormone and put them in some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of plug and store the plugs, that could be
a way to try to reduce the stress on that
[SPEAKER_00]: newly taken cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That rooting gel initially placed in this
situation just causes a mess if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not directly placed in the media there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, want to try to cut them and get
them into the environment as quickly as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some instances that may not always be the
case, you can hold them for a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you want to really reduce that
duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clone harvest to flower harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes about three months from a cutting
clone to harvesting flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that can vary a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means you want to aim for always
having about one-third of plants in a
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative state, two-thirds in a
flowering state.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will allow you that continual harvest
and kind of allowing plants to always come
[SPEAKER_00]: in the flower, always have plants in
vegetative ready to replace those,
[SPEAKER_00]: always ready to take some clones,
have a stock of other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes a lot of coordination.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it does, you can have a nice
continual harvest.
Thank you.
