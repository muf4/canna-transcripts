[SPEAKER_00]: Ever get a soil report back and see base
saturation listed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here on DeBaco University,
we're going to explain a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: what those numbers mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into base saturation
in a soil test report.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see there's some sample
numbers or some ranges given, but let's
[SPEAKER_00]: get into just what is base saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we're looking at base saturation,
just what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the percentage of a soil's cation
exchange capacity occupied by calcium,
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium, and potassium is referred to as
base saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind though, that pH does have an
impact on these levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we say cation exchange capacity,
cation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, soil particles are typically
mostly negatively charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cations are positively charged ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here with our calcium,
our potassium, and our magnesium are all
[SPEAKER_00]: examples of positively charged ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're referring to this as the
ability to exchange those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see them changing as we get more
towards it closer to a neutral pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very acidic pH, we see there's not a lot
of calcium, there's not a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium, not a lot of potassium held on
the soil particle, positive and negative
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we get closer to that neutral,
we're seeing an increase in that number of
[SPEAKER_00]: cations or positive ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at the levels of our base
saturation here, so of low and high.
[SPEAKER_00]: High base saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But base saturation is calculated as a
percentage of CEC, that's cation exchange
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity, occupied by base cations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This figure shows two soils with the same
CEC, but the soil on the right has more
[SPEAKER_00]: base cations in blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore it has a higher base saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So base saturation is closely related to
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: As base saturation increases, so does pH
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at this kind of comparison
here between our two soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have the low base saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So down over here, we have the low base
saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the high base saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice that the soil particles have
negative charges, and we have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: number of cations essentially bound to
that particle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at a low base saturation, we're seeing
a low number of calcium, magnesium,
[SPEAKER_00]: and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here at the high base saturation,
we can see an increase in the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium, potassium, and magnesium ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are again being bound here to that
soil particle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those base cations are considered to
be calcium, magnesium, potassium,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acid cations would be hydrogen,
aluminum, and ammonium here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're exchangeable with the acidity
of lower pH or more acidic levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see more of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a word of caution with our,
when looking at base saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're calculating nutrient or
fertilizer amounts from the base
[SPEAKER_00]: saturation, typically these, if you're
utilizing these numbers, typically this
[SPEAKER_00]: will often lead to an over-application of
those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's best to use the specifics of the
actual soil test numbers and other factors
[SPEAKER_00]: such as pH in organic manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, sadly, fertilizer
companies will use base saturation for
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they calculate the numbers because
usually it comes out in their favor by
[SPEAKER_00]: over-applying a little more nutrients,
a little more fertilizers than you may
[SPEAKER_00]: need if you took into account the actual
numbers, as well as some of the other soil
[SPEAKER_00]: properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Provided on a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless, it still comes back to taking
a quality representative sample with your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil test so that you can have a good
numbers, good data to work with so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: make a formed and educated decision going
forward.
