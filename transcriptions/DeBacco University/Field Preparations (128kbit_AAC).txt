[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm going to go over field
preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like this saying here,
without a plan you can never be lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know there's a lot of variability
depending on the size of your field or
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment that you might have,
so I'm going to speak kind of in general
[SPEAKER_00]: terms here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you start deciding to get your
field together, well, I always say you're
[SPEAKER_00]: already behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something you can be doing each
season if you haven't started yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fall is typically removing the crops,
the plant and cover crops, taking soil
[SPEAKER_00]: tests, the winter, you can actually lime
in the winter, frost heating can help
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporate and compile records inside
where it's nice and warm and develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: plan for next season.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the spring, it's a crazy time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to kill the cover crop,
you want to plant the main crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to have weed control,
your irrigation set up, lots going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Summer, also very busy, monitoring for
disease, trying to be proactive,
[SPEAKER_00]: checking on systems, harvesting crops
ideally.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always something going on in the
fields, even though we have those four
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctive seasons, even if you're not
necessarily growing anything for winter
[SPEAKER_00]: markets, there's always something to do on
the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the field, you should know when to stay
away, and this is particularly important
[SPEAKER_00]: in the springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's wet, stay away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to get the tractor stuck,
you don't want to destroy the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of bad things can happen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're damaging the soil in ways that you
may not be able to get the texture back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the way it was before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when in doubt, stay away, try to find a
drier field, try to do something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know he gets antsy in the springtime,
but try to avoid this particular situation
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timing the cover crop kill with the main
crop is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you can see your main crop and the
cover crop killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That timing, as you'll see again,
is also important to get everything the
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum efficiency of not only the cover
crop to help protect the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also for preparing the field to get
your main crop in there so you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: ideally a yield and make some money from
that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all comes back to having the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the winter is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plan is just an idea to progress you
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means you have to follow the exact
same order of the plan, but having that
[SPEAKER_00]: plan gives a lot of growers confidence and
just helps you out in the long range of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you just that checkpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I ahead?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I behind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Odds are you're probably always going to
think you're behind, but are you getting
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going through and trying to avoid
some of the errors that you may have
found?
[SPEAKER_00]: Be flexible with the conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some springs start very early,
some start late, some are rainy,
[SPEAKER_00]: some are dry, but have a way to try and
avoid forgetting something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's certain key things that you
definitely need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to have those in the forefront on a
whiteboard, something you have to walk by
[SPEAKER_00]: each day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things can always change, but if you
forgot something last year, you forgot to
[SPEAKER_00]: hook up irrigation lines or prep
something, make sure you don't make that
mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make that mistake twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where it comes to be important to
be able to prioritize things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard to have a plan to do this,
but ask yourself, is this the best use of
[SPEAKER_00]: my time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it just convenient at the moment to
have a little dead space and just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: want to go and do this, but is it the best
use of my time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this going to set me up for later in
the season?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do it now, will I have to do it later
anyway?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going to go through and the weeds
are just kind of starting in a field and I
[SPEAKER_00]: go through and I want to till them,
well, I might have to go back next week
[SPEAKER_00]: and till them next time, I'm not going to
plant until two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So prioritize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do things twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to do it once, do it well,
and move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this need to get done now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will there be seedlings ready to be
planted in an unprepared row for the next
[SPEAKER_00]: week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you prepping a row that you're going
to have to reprep because you know your
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings, your transplants may not be
ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is that prioritizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where it comes a little
experience, knowing what you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing what's coming up, trying to plan
against the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just trying to use your time as
efficiently as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timing is everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's possible, work in teams,
focus on one task at a time, get it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I feel kind of the best way to
approach something is if you're tilling
[SPEAKER_00]: and laying plastic, for example,
something very common a lot of farms do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you till the one, two, three,
and four fields today, and then tomorrow
[SPEAKER_00]: you just lay plastic in fields one,
two, three, and four?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you till field one and then lay
plastic in field one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then till field two and lay plastic in
field two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this depends on a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically, if it's an ideal time to
till, you go through and just till them
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hit them all once, and then come back
tomorrow, switch the tractor over,
[SPEAKER_00]: and put the plastic layer and go through
and do all the fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if they're separated by a great
distance, it might be more advantageous to
[SPEAKER_00]: till one than lay plastic on one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, you'd have two different tractors
for this purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep switching equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is where that timing comes
into being everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teams are a great thing if you can kind of
coordinate and work on it and all delegate
[SPEAKER_00]: yourselves to a task.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you kind of want to stay focused on
one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, by tilling all the fields in the
same day, you're just focused on one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put the tiller away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clean the tiller up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can rinse it down and grease the
fittings would be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then go back, grab your plastic layer,
grab that tractor, and make sure you have
[SPEAKER_00]: enough plastic, set up all the rolls,
and just go through and just lay plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: on your perfectly tilled fields from the
day before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, be flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, timing's everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you always think that you're
behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep working at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully things go smoother year to
year.
Thank you.
Thank you.
