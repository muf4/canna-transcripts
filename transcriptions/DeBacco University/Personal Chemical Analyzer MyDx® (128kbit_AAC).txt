[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm going to provide some
information about a personal chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: analyzer called MyDX.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm provided links down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sponsored by this company,
but I know Growers used it and spoken very
[SPEAKER_00]: highly of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to convey some information so
that you're aware of its existence and
[SPEAKER_00]: also what it does and why it's been
gaining popularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, MyDX is the first of its
kind portable chemical analyzer allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: you to affordably and accurately identify
the composition of your cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's a quote directly from the
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a small device, kind of the size of a
wallet here, and it can produce some very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal of MyDX is to provide growers
and medical patients with an easy to use
[SPEAKER_00]: handheld tool to test their cannabis plant
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the advantage that it gives is
that, yes, you can send it off to a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of that quick, easy way to
tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a very small sample here and it
goes into the device right in this little
[SPEAKER_00]: tray here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, at the bottom, this contains
links with more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this handheld chemical analyzer,
you can see how it's not that large,
[SPEAKER_00]: size, at least in kind of length and
width, the size of a typical smartphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It links via a Bluetooth device.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need, there's why it's shown in
relation to a smartphone is there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: Bluetooth connection between those to
allow for easy acquisition and transfer of
[SPEAKER_00]: the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while perform the test, it itself
doesn't have any readouts directly on the
[SPEAKER_00]: unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to communicate with a device here
via Bluetooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it works by a sample of cannabis and
then providing an easy to read analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: for various things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just one example, again,
pulled back from their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids will test for THC,
CBD, CBN, THCV on a kind of profile also
[SPEAKER_00]: of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is an example here,
which you can see, and it kind of gives
[SPEAKER_00]: this nice coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can be able to compare different
varieties easily and quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's also a crowdsource of data to
make connections between personal effects
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed for medical patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, you know, for pain,
for stress, depression on their kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: populating information there based on what
you feel and putting that into a set there
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be accessed through the MyDX app.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I'm not sponsored by the company
here, but a personal chemical analyzer
[SPEAKER_00]: called MyDX might be worth checking out,
especially to make sure that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties that you may be getting or
testing very low in THC and high in the
[SPEAKER_00]: medically benefit of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
