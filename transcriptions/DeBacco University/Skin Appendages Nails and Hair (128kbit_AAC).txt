[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're looking at skin
appendages, specifically nails and hair
[SPEAKER_00]: for this particular video series.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, skin appendages, there's many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're derived from the epidermis,
but extend into the dermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They include nails, hair and hair
follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat
[SPEAKER_00]: glands.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, we're going to focus on
nails and hair in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here it's true for both humans
and also other animals and also nails.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is hair that we're going to be
focusing on hair follicles and just hair
[SPEAKER_00]: in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we've seen this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've seen some of the other videos or
if you haven't, hopefully this is starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to make a little bit more sense here on
what we're going to focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it doesn't make sense now,
hopefully at the end of the video,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll start to pick up some of these
structures of the skin and be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand them a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn more about these,
I have other videos going over some more
[SPEAKER_00]: details.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, starting with this one, nails,
we're just going to do a brief overview of
[SPEAKER_00]: nails.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's scale-like modifications of
the epidermis and made of hard keratin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're that really hard kind of keratin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They correspond with hooves and claws,
and they grow from a nail matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you look at your nails,
this is how it looks on a cutaway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a little gross there,
but that's a cutaway of your nail,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's that protective region there on
the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made from the same stuff as hooves
and also the claws of the cat here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, our hair, filamentous strands of dead
keratinized cells produced by hair
[SPEAKER_00]: follicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, is hair alive?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's kind of made up of dead cells
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains hard keratin, which is tougher
and more durable than soft keratin of the
[SPEAKER_00]: skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it does continue to grow here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our, we have our vessels here,
our arteries and our veins at the very
[SPEAKER_00]: base, nerve endings down here,
and then hair will continue to grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: protrude out the surface here and continue
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's the function of hair,
and where is it found?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the functions are really to maintain
warmth, as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also alerts the body in the presence of
insects on the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It acts as a little appendage when
something crawls on us or lands on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it can alert the body to
kind of get that insect away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It guards the scalp against physical
trauma, heat, and sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a protective layer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here, the sheep here are definitely
for wool for the heat retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it found on the body?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's distributed over the entire
skin surface, except for certain areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The palms and soles and lips are areas
that it's not found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nipples and portions of the external
genitalia also it's not found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, these are a few exceptions where hair
is not distributed amongst the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic hair anatomy, and I'm not going
to go into great detail on this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are different layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parts, as I pointed out before,
it's a root and bedded within the skin,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the shaft projects above the skin
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three main layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in this black and white image
here, the medulla is the main center
[SPEAKER_00]: portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the core.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the cortex, and then the cuticle
on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, hair is dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's keratinized.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the basic subunit,
the basic building block is actually made
[SPEAKER_00]: from amino acids, and those amino acids
get coiled, and they get coiled on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: coils put together to form the hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is hair so strong?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's this multiple kind of twisting,
binding, coiled layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you kind of want to prove this to
yourself, you could take a paper towel
[SPEAKER_00]: roll, and just take one of the paper
towels and kind of pull on the paper
[SPEAKER_00]: towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice it'll tear very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could take that same paper towel and
start to twist it and turn it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then try to pull on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a lot harder,
and that kind of is what the reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: the supporting reason for why these
filaments are so strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that twisting and turning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing works with toilets.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hair follicle, we have a little zoomed
in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root sheath extends from the epidermal
surface into the dermis, and bending hair
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulates the endings, hence the hair
axis touch sensitive receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned that down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have nerves attached to that,
and by bending the end here, that is being
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred, and that's what's alerting us
to something present on our skin,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as an insect, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goosebumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The erector pili muscle, we're located
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bundle of smooth muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you haven't learned about muscles
yet, smooth muscle is involuntary muscle,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it contracts and makes the hair stand
erect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it contracts, that's the muscle
shrinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when that's shrinking or getting
basically the muscles are sliding over one
[SPEAKER_00]: another and pulled together, that's going
to take that hair and it's going to stand
[SPEAKER_00]: it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why it does this is it
separates out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates a little bit of a barrier here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stops air from getting in direct
contact with the surface, at least a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a buffer factor here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that does is that kind of coats the
skin here and allows it to stay a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, muscles contracting take energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also going to generate a little bit
more heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only does this kind of lift the
area and create an insulating factor,
[SPEAKER_00]: that buffer factor between the cold air
and the skin, it also generates a little
[SPEAKER_00]: heat from all these muscles contracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a little math here with
hair growth and hair loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll first talk about the positive here
of hair growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hair growth, this is just an average I
found about two millimeters per week.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is active growing hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I pose a question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long in days would it take for your
hair to grow to six inches, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: estimated to be about ear length,
or 30 inches, about hip length in this
[SPEAKER_00]: case, as growth rate of two millimeters
per week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, your hair may grow faster,
a little slower, but using this figure,
[SPEAKER_00]: how could we calculate this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to walk you through some of the
basic math.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're taking chemistry, dimensional
analysis is what we're going to be using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with our math calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, two millimeters per week is what's
given.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to convert that to centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do millimeters to a
centimeter conversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take our millimeters, we convert to
centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want millimeters to cancel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's millimeters in the
numerator, there's millimeters in the
[SPEAKER_00]: denominator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, one centimeter is equal to 10
millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to convert our
millimeters, our canceled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want centimeters to inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, 2.54 centimeters is the same as one
inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our centimeters cancel out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're left with inches per week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not what I was asking for though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we want to cancel weeks and calculate
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one week is seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put this in green here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week cancels with days.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week, because one week is the same as
seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We multiply all our numerators,
we get two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiply all our denominators,
we get 177.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two divided by 177.8 equals 0.011248
inches per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we calculate what I asked at six
inches?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, six inches, if you're growing at
this much per day, it'll take
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately 533 days for your hair to
grow six inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it grows two millimeters per week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also added another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if it grows 30 inches?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to get to 30 inches, it's going to
be 2,677 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes a little bit more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We convert canceled days out because
there's 365 days in a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or to grow 30 inches at the rate of two
millimeters per week, it would take about
[SPEAKER_00]: 7.3 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's just the math again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a little bit of the background to
provide you with how I got to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That answer located down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on, a little bit more of a negative
hair loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thinning, it's typically age-related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Male pattern baldness.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also female pattern baldness,
as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: The incidence of male pattern baldness by
age.
[SPEAKER_00]: The percent of the population,
you notice that it increases as the age
[SPEAKER_00]: also increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advanced is this blue region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moderate is this kind of yellow region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And early stage is that dark burgundy type
region there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see as males tend to get older,
the percent of the population that have
[SPEAKER_00]: some instance of male pattern baldness
increases overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we talked about hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about pigmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hair color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hair color facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with the facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, pigmentation is by the melanocytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're at the base of the hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of melanin for black or brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's distinctive melanin for red hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: White is a decrease in melanin and air
bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that, the dula of the hair causing it
to have its white appearance, losing its
[SPEAKER_00]: color, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is genetically determined to the
influence of hormones in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you've probably heard hair
color, there's these bunch of stereotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put a picture of just three different
people with three different, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: four different people with four different
types of hair color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blonde are usually considered fun and
social.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a negative would be unintelligent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brunettes typically are seen as
intelligent and mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the negatives are typically seen as
plain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black is mysterious and hard workers,
or untrustworthy on the negative side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red hair is being unique and interesting,
but also as a negative as aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I found these are stereotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of these really have any science that
hold true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at these four images,
do you kind of see how these stereotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: can get generated?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is just people progressing
these stereotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't hold true at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that does hold true is
particularly for redheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a quick fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Redheads are actually harder to sedate
than other hair groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using the most common anesthetics,
they require an average of 20% more
[SPEAKER_00]: anesthesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have a higher tolerance than
normal people, which is other hair colors,
[SPEAKER_00]: to pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because of the melanocortin-1
receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mutation that gives red hair and
also triggers excessive release of
[SPEAKER_00]: pheomelanin, which is, among other things,
stimulates the brain receptor related to
[SPEAKER_00]: pain sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just kind of interesting note about the
redheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's not many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1% to 2% of the world's population
naturally has red hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: National Geographic made a prediction that
by the year 2060, redheads would be
[SPEAKER_00]: extinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interesting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gives you just a little bit of
the largest population groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotland, 13% are natural redheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ireland, 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wales, up to 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States, only about 2% to 6%
are natural redheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I bring this up is this
came up in an article I put down here for
[SPEAKER_00]: this little demand for redheaded sperm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sperm bakes wanted to turn down redheads
because they weren't getting a demand for
[SPEAKER_00]: that sperm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world's largest sperm bake started
turning down redheads' donors due to this
[SPEAKER_00]: small demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's other ethical issues,
but this should be easy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a male that's redhead,
they're just going to deny them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that should eliminate the redhead
genes from the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's actually not that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eliminating redhead genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really ban redhead sperm
because, yes, OK, the male is red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's showing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember from our Hardy-Weinberg
equations, there's also a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are carriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because there's more carriers than
actual redheads, there's actually a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the redhead gene located within the
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: That allele is actually very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of carriers, even though not
many express it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what sounded effective is actually have
supporting science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So banning redhead sperm donors has really
a small effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the policy of banning redheads,
we see there is a decrease, but not nearly
[SPEAKER_00]: as dramatic as there was no policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just an interesting fact here,
how we have that allele that's carried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people are carriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That simply, what sounded easy,
to ban redheads to eliminate that from the
[SPEAKER_00]: sperm bank did not actually hold true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that gives you a little bit
of the science and kind of some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stereotypes and also some of the
background on hair color and nails as
[SPEAKER_00]: these appendages of the skin.
Thank you.
