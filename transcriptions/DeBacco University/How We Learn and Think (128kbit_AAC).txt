[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look a little
bit about how we learn and think.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we process information?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we go through a problem,
work together to solve a solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how do we look at a situation that
might be ever-changing, and how do we
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize our returns there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So thinking is allowed in this section
here in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, looking at how we learn and
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, our brain is where most of this
action occurs, and it consists of billions
[SPEAKER_00]: of interconnected neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our senses stimulate specific neuron
pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have something called short-term
memory, which is residual sensitivity
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways, and we have long-term memory,
which is physical changes that may occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And long-term memory can cause by repeated
stimulation and intense emotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensory input and memory storage share the
same circuits, and this causes
[SPEAKER_00]: associations to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll find a lot in the slides that I
provide here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We produced the pictures here so you can
kind of try to make associations and
[SPEAKER_00]: connections to hopefully take something,
a topic that might be new to you that
[SPEAKER_00]: might just go into the short-term memory
and try to make it a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: longer-lasting in your memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how we know things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, our brains are great at two major
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recognizing patterns and filling in
sensory gaps typically through the process
[SPEAKER_00]: of storytelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see there's a definite pattern
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as here, there's a pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at this pattern to try to
determine what comes next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take a look here for a second to
determine what comes next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you said a green rectangle,
you'd be correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this again.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this pattern, what comes next?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you said yellow star, you'd be correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, what comes next here?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you said blue square, you would be
correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see how we're able to quickly
recognize and identify these patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we want to be careful because
this can get us into trouble through
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern matching.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could recognize patterns that may not
be real or misinterpreted, or we could not
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize patterns that are real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at developing
patterns while we're very good at doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that, we want to make sure that we're not
kind of matching a pattern that may not
[SPEAKER_00]: exist there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For storytelling, not checking to see if
stories are true could be an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% personal disagreements are between
people that begin as wrong stories each
[SPEAKER_00]: has told himself about the other's
motivations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd get into this, like, he said,
she said type thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure when you're doing
storytelling that you're able to fact
[SPEAKER_00]: check certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to just go off rumors and
hearsay.
[SPEAKER_00]: In science, we're looking at testing our
patterns and stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: We typically do this through a variation
of the scientific method where we have
[SPEAKER_00]: observations that lead to hypothesis that
allow us to test those hypothesis that
[SPEAKER_00]: then, through analysis and observations,
we can modify that hypothesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: go through more observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why we tend to get into this
kind of circle here, because we have
[SPEAKER_00]: observations that lead to questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those questions then hopefully lead to
hypothesis that we can test.
[SPEAKER_00]: We experiment, we analyze, we draw a
conclusion, and we do more observations,
[SPEAKER_00]: which leads to more questions,
and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of have this kind of revolving
kind of circle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we have internal loops that
occur here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part here in science in general is
to stay inquisitive, to keep asking
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, to keep trying to find
something else, to develop some
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusions, but also develop some more
questions and go through and do some more
[SPEAKER_00]: observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, for studying, relating this
to class, three hours of study at one time
[SPEAKER_00]: is not effective for long-term memory
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Studying the same thing 20 minutes three
times a day for three days is more
[SPEAKER_00]: effective for long-term memory formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of the topics we're going to
go over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to come back and relate to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to assume that you know them
when we first went over them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using your brain to rephrase or rework the
material is more effective for long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: memory formation than repetitive reading
or listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as effective as these video lectures
may be for listening and repetitive going
[SPEAKER_00]: over, I want to make sure you can rephrase
and rework the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we're able to do more of that in
class.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're able to develop that more long-term
memory information.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of applications for the
material that we go over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind, cram studying for three
hours the night before the test is not as
[SPEAKER_00]: effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Studying the same thing for 20 minutes
three times a day for three days is much
[SPEAKER_00]: more effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're able to plan ahead and do
some of that throughout this course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
