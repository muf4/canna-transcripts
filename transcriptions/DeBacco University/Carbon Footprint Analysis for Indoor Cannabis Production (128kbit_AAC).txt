[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBacco University video,
we're going to go over carbon footprint
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis for indoor cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if you're not considering growing
cannabis indoors, this is an important
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration because we're all part of
the electrical power grid and we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be mindful of the impact that indoor
cannabis production has.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at the carbon
footprint analysis for indoor cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, here is the research article,
proper citation, front page kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: screenshot, and as well as a direct link.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to look at some of the
information presented here in more detail,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is going to provide a general
summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, cannabis energy consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the emerging industry of indoor
cannabis production utilizes high energy
[SPEAKER_00]: intensive process and is highly
inefficient overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States, this represents an
annual energy expenditure of about $6
[SPEAKER_00]: billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're seeing here is kind of the
projected from 2019 to 2030 electricity
[SPEAKER_00]: demand, the kind of core demand growth,
the electric vehicles, data centers,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see this over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The anticipated great increase in cannabis
cultivation regarding power consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: and really just power consumption overall
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking specifically about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing lighting, ventilation and air
conditioning being the vast majority
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be wondering about what's this
vehicles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there is transport involved with
cannabis too in general for consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the carbon footprint for indoor
cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one kilogram of final product is
associated with emissions of about $4,600.
[SPEAKER_00]: kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions to
the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aggregate US emissions are equivalent to
those of about 3 million cars to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of a little bit concerning
when we're looking at scaling up potential
[SPEAKER_00]: for indoor cannabis production,
the energy inputs that is needed for that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the carbon footprint for indoor
cannabis production, we kind of saw a
[SPEAKER_00]: graphical representation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're seeing a little more chart
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers need to consider all aspects of
plant production that require energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting is typically the highest,
but what this is also ventilation
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements that will also have energy
demands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be mindful of that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to vehicles that said drying,
water handling, there's a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: other factors to take into consideration
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just those, even though those
might be the greatest or highest energy
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at the carbon footprint
and we're looking at kind of the energy
[SPEAKER_00]: cost at three levels of efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for indoor cannabis, the carbon
footprint, represented here, and here we
[SPEAKER_00]: see indoor cannabis, the electrical cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're seeing the worst, the average
and improved conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this assumes a wholesale price of
$4,400 per kilogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind that wholesale prices are
highly variable and also are poorly
[SPEAKER_00]: documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the worst conditions, these would be
the least efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Average would be your typical cannabis
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And improved conditions are ones that are
going to use more efficiency operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might come with more upfront costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully long-term reduction in
costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that there is some
variation overall, but we can still see
[SPEAKER_00]: that we are definitely consuming a lot of
energy with our indoor cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does it compare?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, it consumes a lot, but how does it
compare to other industries?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using 2006 data by sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chemist production sector is the
greatest energy consumer at nearly 20
[SPEAKER_00]: megajoules, and that's MJ, per thousand
dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now chemist is followed next by the paper
industry, which is about 14 megajoules per
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here though, clear,
sadly winner in this category as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: energy consumption goes compared to these
other sectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if we're going through, we're going
to compare cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is based on sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now if we compare it by US building
type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the United States, chemist production
requires eight times as much energy per
[SPEAKER_00]: square foot as a typical US commercial
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also specifically, it's four times more
than a hospital and about 18 times more
[SPEAKER_00]: than an average US home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this can give you that idea of
the massive amount of primary energy
[SPEAKER_00]: that's needed for an indoor cannabis
growing facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So outdoor growing, why does everyone grow
outdoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, outdoor growing is also not energy
free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is less energy required,
but it's not energy free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shifting cultivation outdoors can nearly
eliminate the use for cultivation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, energy is still required for
water pumping, vehicle transport during
[SPEAKER_00]: production and distribution remains part
of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically this is more needed than for
an indoor operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be a little more
increase in cost there, but you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have the venting, not have the
air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have the energy
generation cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: A common perception is that the potency of
cannabis produced indoors exceeds that of
[SPEAKER_00]: the production of outdoors, leading to
consumers to demand cannabis being
[SPEAKER_00]: produced indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, federal sources listed here,
as well as independent testing labs
[SPEAKER_00]: actually find similar potencies when best
practices are being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: The indoor facilities can produce a better
looking flower and that's sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with the purchase of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind the potencies could be
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor is going to usually have a more
consistent and better perceived look
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at extraction really
would not matter if you're growing indoors
[SPEAKER_00]: or outdoors, but outdoors will have less
overall energy inputs needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So negatives of outdoor production,
again, that's because outdoor production
[SPEAKER_00]: is like the best way and the only way it
should be grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor cultivation still has some
negative environmental impacts other than
[SPEAKER_00]: its energy use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could result in deforestation,
destruction of wetlands, soil runoff,
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides, and over application of
fertilizers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not free of potential negative
impacts, but overall they can be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit less compared to what we've seen here
with the carbon input for indoor cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind as consumers,
you're driving the market there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are demanding the indoor
production, keep in mind of some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other side effects that come along with
that production process of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
