[SPEAKER_00]: Now here I'm going to go over footwear
evidence comparisons and have a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good example to show you, which you may
not catch during the duration of this
[SPEAKER_00]: video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're welcome to pause the video or go
in the description, download the slides
[SPEAKER_00]: for yourself and try to look at some of
the points that I bring up because a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of this takes just a lot of going back and
forth, a lot of time spent to develop that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of detailed eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can footwear impressions tell you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they can actually tell you a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can identify the footwear,
eliminate certain footwear, they identify
[SPEAKER_00]: participants as a suspect in a crime,
they can kind of offer locations of
[SPEAKER_00]: impressions, how those might play into
what may have occurred, rebuttal or
[SPEAKER_00]: confirm alibis, link suspects,
determine shoe size, try to determine
[SPEAKER_00]: number of people present, track,
kind of see where the direction of travel
[SPEAKER_00]: was, so they can actually tell you quite a
bit and that's why they're an important
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So footwear evidence, kind of these
impressions, we'll have kind of found a
[SPEAKER_00]: great example here where you're looking at
a print, looking at some of the details
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of pointing out some of the key
components to this particular shoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's very important to kind of orient
yourself, have an idea of the size so that
[SPEAKER_00]: when you have the actual sample,
you're able to go through and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: glean all of these wonderful details.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you're looking at kind of the
manufacturer to just the general size to
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously looking at just the general
tread as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how may that play into certain aspects
when you're making these comparisons?
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have kind of class characteristics
to look at and that's what you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, keep in mind class characteristics in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's numerous class characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only going to kind of give you that
general kind of size, tread design,
[SPEAKER_00]: things you can obviously see.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still important.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very important for potentially of
eliminating certain shoe types.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see kind of a whole bunch listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll even move myself kind of out of the
image here so you can kind of be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine and see that kind of comparison
between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these class characteristics can be
simple as manufacturer, tread design,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be able to get to
potentially, if you think that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: things that match on a class
characteristic end, you want to get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: wear characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can be getting into more to
individual evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question shoe print shows wear
characteristics that are similar to that
[SPEAKER_00]: of the known shoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very little wear on lateral edges in the
forefoot section of the shoe print of the
[SPEAKER_00]: shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at, you know, you're having
a lot of wear up here and not so much down
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's getting into wear characteristics,
getting into that more individual
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, as I mentioned, those class
characteristics, here's some very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: ones kind of identified here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, class characteristics are
distinctive of a particular model of shoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Identification of class characteristics
and the footwear impressions allow
[SPEAKER_00]: examiners to determine the manufacturer
model, sizing of shoe wear, and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: impressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some class characteristics present in shoe
above, and I've kind of provided you with
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of comparisons here that you
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we get more specific,
we get into those individual
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about individual
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now looking at characteristics that
are very distinctive to that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: shoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: These consist of random damage on the
outsole.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could cause a little, there's a
little piece of gum attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a crack in one of the areas of the
shoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really matching it up to something
that isn't found on all shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photograph above, there's about 12
individual characteristics here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can kind of see highlighted in that
comparison of the actual shoe to the
[SPEAKER_00]: impression provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why a detailed impression is so
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's kind of that last detailed
impression comparison with some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: arrows indicating to allow you to kind of
see kind of where those arrows are
[SPEAKER_00]: pointing and can you kind of pick that
piece of evidence out and can you kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: identify those individual characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to kind of do some
comparisons, you could go grab one of your
[SPEAKER_00]: own shoes and see if you can identify any
individual characteristics for your own
[SPEAKER_00]: shoe with this helpful video.
