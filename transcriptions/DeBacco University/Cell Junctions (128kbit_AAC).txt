[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is a short video lecture on
cell junctions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three major ones we're going to go
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the first one,
tight junctions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a specialized connection of two
adjacent animal cell membranes,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually eliminating space.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, here's our tight junctions really
close together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you can think of them kind of
like fusing together, super tight
[SPEAKER_00]: junctions, eliminating any space.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the two hands to be touching
here, here are tight junctions that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically eliminating that space that may
be present there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Desmosomes is the other form of
cell-to-cell junction, a structure by
[SPEAKER_00]: which two adjacent cells are attached,
forms with protein plates in the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: membranes linked by filaments.
[SPEAKER_00]: These function like rivets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've seen the underside of like a
bridge, a bridge will have rivets.
[SPEAKER_00]: These little areas here are rivets,
and that's kind of the same kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: concept that's occurring here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our desmosomes have these rivet-like
structures, or these structures homologous
[SPEAKER_00]: to the rivets that hold up the bridge to
be able to adhere one cell to another
[SPEAKER_00]: cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last form of cell junctions would be
gap junctions in animal cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are specialized intercellular
connections that join the cytoplasm of two
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here is one cell down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gap junction is this little kind of
protein like channel allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: communication to occur from the lower cell
to the upper cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in animal cells are called gap
junctions.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in plant cells they have a
different name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called plasma desmata.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're channels through the cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, plant cells have the cell wall
that allows molecules and substances to
[SPEAKER_00]: move freely as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is advantageous for the cell because
it reduces the energy when it's looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: move particular nutrients or it could be
waste products, or signals from one cell
[SPEAKER_00]: to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look just like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're holes in the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plasma desmata are holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, while this is great and allows
things to move freely, viruses really
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy plasma desmata in the sense that
they can move through a leaf structure
[SPEAKER_00]: very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the downfalls of plasma
desmata.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, the same basic structure occurs
in plant cells as plasma desmata and as
[SPEAKER_00]: animal cells as gap junctions,
even though they're basic with the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, plant cells have that cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That nice comparison between these three
here, remember gap junctions providing the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoplasmic channels from one cell to
adjacent cells for communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Desmosomes are function like rivets
fastening cells together in our strong
[SPEAKER_00]: sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our tight junctions, remember tight
junctions are membranes that are adjacent
[SPEAKER_00]: cells that are very tightly bonded
together forming seals around the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some examples of the three main
types of cell junctions.
