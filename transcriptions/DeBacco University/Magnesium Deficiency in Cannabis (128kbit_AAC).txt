[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at
magnesium deficiency in cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So magnesium is a vital nutrient,
something some growers may not initially
[SPEAKER_00]: think about, but when they see a problem,
something that may come up on the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And be sure to check out some of my other
videos on looking at other deficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get on with magnesium in
particular in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So magnesium, well, why does a plant even
need magnesium?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often, you know, question growers may
ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that magnesium is a mobile
nutrient, meaning it can move through the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a dominant role with the
photosynthetic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's associated with processing the
chloroplast, that green color,
[SPEAKER_00]: that real nice green color we typically
associate with plants as part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility of magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up to 35% of the leaf magnesium is
actually located within those
[SPEAKER_00]: chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now magnesium is involved with the Robisco
enzyme activation activity, and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to initiate that carbon
binding with the photosynthetic process
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the magnesium does impact the
chloroplast structure and the synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is involved on a micro level,
but we can see macro effects in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The deficiency leads to reduction in the
plant's ability to utilize carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: assimilation rates and reduces rates of
biomass formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can reduce the yield in the end
result and also in the simple plant
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both negative aspects that growers want to
avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a trial was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of a unique thing here with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cultivar's wife, the police planter,
you're going to see about 80 days old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grown in a greenhouse to help
maintain consistent conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see a control plant that
was fed a balanced fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a test plant was fed all the
nutrients at optimum levels, except the
[SPEAKER_00]: one being studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it'll be a magnesium
deficient plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So specifically, here's the cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we can see, see it's a little hard to
tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoomed in is another image that I found.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That slight yellowing of the lower leaves
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The veins of the plant will remain that
typical consistent dark green color.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're looking at is in between those
veins, you have the yellowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have this kind of dark green veins,
but then you have that yellowing that is
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That yellowing on lower leaves in
particular is characteristic of a
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in cannabis, there can also be some
stippling, some brown spots that you kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of see going on here, at least a little
bit here on the lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not turn completely yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great example of how
sometimes the plants don't follow the
[SPEAKER_00]: textbook exactly, because this is actual
cannabis plant that was particularly fed
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium deficient fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of get to see firsthand what
may occur or how the plant may react.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not always be that textbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, you're noticing you have those brown
spots that are kind of developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another kind of indication of a
potential magnesium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to be first seen in those lower
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're seeing browning at the top,
that might be something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're looking at that older leaves,
those lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, progress up the plant if the
problem is not corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to recognize,
oh, it's occurring at the lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me start to feed some magnesium
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of growers ask, well,
what may that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some different options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So applications should be made repeatedly
in our regular intervals until the problem
[SPEAKER_00]: stops progressing, because it might take a
little while for that to build up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't expect a one time application to
kind of fix the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read some suggested fertilizers and
suggested application rates for a two by
[SPEAKER_00]: two foot area, but followed the
recommendations on the package that you
[SPEAKER_00]: may be purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epsom salts is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of quick and easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: One to two tablespoons per gallon,
and that can be applied as a soil drench
[SPEAKER_00]: or can also be applied to the leaves
directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage is it's very easy to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drugstores have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go out, grab it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can apply it the same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only supplies magnesium, and there's
some sulfur also added there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Kalmag product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's by Botanicare, but you want to
start at about an ounce to a gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the advantage of that is it has a
magnesium, but it also supplies the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: with some calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be an issue, especially if
you're growing in coco coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kinds of the options prevented here
that is the most expensive, but it does
[SPEAKER_00]: have the ability to help correct that
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially if you have a calcium
issue, you can help correct that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one I can include here is
dolomitic lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing an outdoor
application or you need a pH correction
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway, if your soil tends to be a little
bit on the acidic side, need to add lime,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can add dolomitic lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a calcium lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has not quite as much on magnesium
with it, but dolomitic would be a great
[SPEAKER_00]: option there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free, I say, with the lime because
that lime naturally is high in magnesium,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it can only be used for soil
applications that you're trying to raise
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of got to balance your options
in what particular growing situations
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this provides a little bit of
that kind of that real world kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: example of how plants may not always
follow the textbook, but gives you
[SPEAKER_00]: something to look at or helps you identify
the potential deficiency that you may be
[SPEAKER_00]: having.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
