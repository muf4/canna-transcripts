[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is going to be a very quick
overview of eukaryotic cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking here is an example of just a model
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an animal cell and looking at some
of the components and what basically
[SPEAKER_00]: allows you to look at this and define it
as a eukaryotic cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to go over any of the
individual organelles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be saved for another video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, eukaryotic cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The domain eukaryote, what's it include?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you looked at my video on prokaryotes,
as we talked about archaea and bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at basically their breast,
the protists, the fungi, the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the animals here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are eukaryotic cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's a eukaryotic cell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they contain membrane-bound nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have specialized organelles,
a plasma membrane, and are actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: in comparison, much larger than
prokaryotic cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cells, example plant cells,
have a cell wall, and that's what this is
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the key part here is these
membrane-bound organelles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what makes them distinctly
different than our very simple and more
[SPEAKER_00]: primitive prokaryotic cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: These organelles, for example,
are basically little compartments and they
[SPEAKER_00]: perform very specific functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They isolate reactions from one another,
so it allows them to be membrane-bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a nice representative cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 14 organelles basically identified
in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other videos will go through these,
but if you're able to kind of recognize
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these, like what number nine is,
clearly the mitochondria knows the folds
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One and two, nucleus is the larger
structure, nucleolus is the smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: structure in there, and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, being able to see the fact that
this cell has organelles puts it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: category of eukaryote, and then
understanding what all of these do will be
[SPEAKER_00]: saved for another video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two classes of organelles are endomembrane
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are organelles that communicate with
one another via channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: These could be the endoplasmic reticulum,
the Golgi apparatus, and there's the other
[SPEAKER_00]: type of organelles, the energy-related
organelles, the mitochondria and the
[SPEAKER_00]: chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are both independent and
self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of generate their own energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of folds in both of these,
high surface area to volume ratio on the
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondria present in all cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember our chloroplasts only present
in plant cells because they go through the
[SPEAKER_00]: process of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A nice comparison between prokaryotes and
eukaryote cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good way to kind of go down the list and
see if you can be able to recognize or
[SPEAKER_00]: identify certain characteristics of one
versus the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to compare and contrast the two
makes for an excellent quiz or test
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going through and looking at the type
of nucleus, remember eukaryotes have that
[SPEAKER_00]: true nucleus, that double membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prokaryotes just have a nuclear region,
no really true defined nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA is circular in prokaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Linear in eukaryotes and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're welcome to look again,
pause the video and compare the two and
[SPEAKER_00]: look back at the prokaryote video if you'd
like to review that one and be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: compare both of these different types
because you're probably going to see it
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere in the future.
Thank you.
Good luck.
