[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're looking at cardiac
muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, hopefully, this is the first one
you're watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two others on skeletal muscle and
smooth muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the end of watching all three of those,
you hopefully can develop an understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: for what makes each unique and also where
is each typically found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one's going to focus on cardiac
muscle, which is found in the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our cardiac muscle, it's composed of
chains of single cells, each with its own
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: These chains are interconnected,
forming a lattice work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each heart cell is coupled to its
neighbors by a gap junction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you remember from the skeletal
system, these striations are found in both
[SPEAKER_00]: cardiac and skeletal muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what makes skeletal muscle here
unique are these kind of little lines
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see a zoomed in version of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is, is an intercalated disc.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is allowing electrical signals
between cells to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want our heart to contract at regular
intervals, and these help cause orderly
[SPEAKER_00]: pulsations of the heart that electrical
signals able to travel through these
[SPEAKER_00]: cardiac muscle cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the cardiac muscle, the striated
muscle, it's present only in the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very unique type of muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's found only in the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fibers have a single nucleus and are
branched and joined by one another by
[SPEAKER_00]: these intercalated discs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very important and
distinguishing factor of cardiac muscle
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes it unique compared to smooth
and skeletal muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly here, these very important discs,
these intercalated discs, are part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cardiac muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They contain gap junctions of these
desmosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, desmosomes is a cell structure that
anchors the ends of the cardiac muscle
[SPEAKER_00]: fibers together so that the cells do not
pull apart during the stress of individual
[SPEAKER_00]: fibers contracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see a little bit of an example
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Desmosomes are our cell-to-cell junctions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of holding everything together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that we have cardiac muscle
mitochondria located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example of our nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be able to distinguish our cardiac
muscle compared to the other two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind, because we have this
rhythmic contractions of the heart,
[SPEAKER_00]: we also have those regular electrical
impulses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going through and ensuring our heart has
those nice regulated intervals and
[SPEAKER_00]: pulsations.
Thank you.
