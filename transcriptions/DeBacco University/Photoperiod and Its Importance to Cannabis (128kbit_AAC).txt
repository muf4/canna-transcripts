[SPEAKER_00]: So when growing cannabis, it's very
important to keep in mind the photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're exposing your plants to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The photo period is the duration of
continuous light or continuous darkness
[SPEAKER_00]: that those plants are being exposed to,
because that will impact whether it stays
[SPEAKER_00]: in a vegetative state or it goes into a
flowering state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So photo period, in the general sense,
is described as the length of day or
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time the plant is exposed to
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, plants are only able to tell
the length of night, but this is typically
[SPEAKER_00]: just assumed to be the opposite of the day
length.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you hear something called a long day
that is the same as saying a short night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long days of summer refer to the fact that
there are more hours of sun exposure,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means the nights must be short.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, short days are long nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Short days, which occur during the winter,
refer to the fact that there are less
[SPEAKER_00]: hours of sun exposure during the day,
which makes the night time longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, it's a longer, cooler area,
especially around Yukon and southern New
[SPEAKER_00]: England.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good days kind of curl up next to a
campfire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those long, cold nights, which are short
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photo period related to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understanding the photo period is critical
to cannabis production because during long
[SPEAKER_00]: days, this signals the vegetative growth
or leaf production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Short days signals flowering or bud
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, long days and short days will
affect the morphology of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So exposing cannabis to the plant to light
will, depending on what light the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is exposed to, will depend on the
behavior that it exhibits.
[SPEAKER_00]: A small plant will go into flower if given
short days.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is particularly important for those
that are using artificial light to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure their timers are set properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Artificial light and timers are important
because when growing cannabis under
[SPEAKER_00]: artificial light, it's important to ensure
the timers are functioning in the correct
[SPEAKER_00]: manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a way of checking this.
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 to 24 hours of continuous light
exposure will allow the vegetative state
[SPEAKER_00]: to continue to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 hours or less of continual light
exposure will induce flowering in your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's some special cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, cannabis falls into this
category.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have our long days, that's going to
cause it to stay vegetative.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get less than that critical length,
we get those short days and those long
[SPEAKER_00]: nights that will induce flowering at any
stage of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got to be careful here in the
sense that if we notice it's still a short
[SPEAKER_00]: day, but we have this exposure of light
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure that we're not having
any light exposure because that will break
[SPEAKER_00]: up the night because plants are only able
to tell the hours of continuous darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, technically we have the same
hours of darkness we would think,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in this case we had the lights come on
for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a faulty switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be someone turning on the
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: unintentionally that breaks the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, these two sections of
darkness equate to this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant will remain the vegetative
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opposite will occur with long day
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important for people in the floral
industry, forcing things into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a cannabis where you may want them
to flower or not flower, it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: important that you maintain or look at
that continual hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long hours of continual darkness will
induce flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Short hours of continual darkness will
keep them in the vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also something called auto
flowering cannabis, and these are
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars that flower regardless of the
photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can be great for entry level
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically the genetics are a little bit
more limiting, but they do allow the
[SPEAKER_00]: grower not to worry about the amount of
photo period that it's being exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can help predict particularly new
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help them predict when to expect flowers
and harvest of their crop.
Thank you.
See you next time.
