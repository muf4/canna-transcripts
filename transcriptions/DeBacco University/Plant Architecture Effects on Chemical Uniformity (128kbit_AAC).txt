[SPEAKER_00]: On this tobacco university video,
I'm going to break down a scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: article that looks at plant structure
effects on chemical uniformity in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's take a look and see how
plant structure affects chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: uniformity in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, this is the research article
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to look at it in more detail,
I'd recommend you do because they do get
[SPEAKER_00]: into some great specifics of their pruning
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might want to read this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you find the pruning method that you
think you want to investigate further,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might want to go back here to this
original source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, plant morphology and bud
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants shoot growth pattern and shape
is commonly manipulated by growers
[SPEAKER_00]: worldwide by numerous techniques,
including planting densities, trestling,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant hormones, and by the physical
removal of plant organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's correct to the researchers
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the physical location of
the inflorescence on the plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: relation to the light source, it was also
investigated in this study, as we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both these factors contribute to the
quality of the total harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to keep in mind that not only
the structure of the plant, but in
[SPEAKER_00]: relation to those buds into the intensity
of the light can also impact their overall
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the description of some of their
pruning methods and they go through them
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're kind of, they're pretty,
they're quite extensive here, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a control, which is great,
and a defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This BBLR is bottom branches and leaves
removed, commonly referred to as
[SPEAKER_00]: lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where you see what they said,
BBLR, you can think of that as
[SPEAKER_00]: lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they went through and they have
primary branch removal, secondary branch
[SPEAKER_00]: removal, single prune, and double prune.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of highlight the double prune here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pruning the plants twice at the
duration of the single prune and a second
[SPEAKER_00]: time at the transition to the short day or
flowering treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, just as a reminder in this trial,
they stated that this experiment was
[SPEAKER_00]: conducted in a randomized, random
experimental design with six replicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Replicated groups for each treatment was
arranged in three rows, out of which a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant from the center row was then sampled
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives you an idea of their general
structure based on the different plant
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture manipulation treatments that
they mentioned here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's kind of look at the data now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of learned all the backgrounds
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now let's get into the actual data
component of the architecture related to
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoid yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: The results reveal that pruning the plants
twice during cultivation was the optimum
[SPEAKER_00]: practice for increasing yield and other
treatments decreased or did not affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: yield quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know there's a lot of numbers here,
but we're looking at the different
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture manipulation treatments on
the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CBGA in grams per plant, CBDA,
CBDVA, THCA, THEVA, and CBCA, all in grams
[SPEAKER_00]: per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a lot of numbers here,
but what we're noticing is I highlighted
[SPEAKER_00]: it here with a little kind of green
outline box here is that the double prune
[SPEAKER_00]: method for all of the treatments here had
the highest rate of return in grams per
[SPEAKER_00]: plant of the various cannabinoids provided
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is some variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are talking about plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are talking about kind of a living
organism here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some had very close similarities to A,
A being the highest number and then
[SPEAKER_00]: subsequent letters indicating significant
differences from a statistical tandem
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint using the Tukey's HD test being
different from the comparison there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the kind of take home message
here, we can definitely see the double
[SPEAKER_00]: prune method improved all of these
particular cannabinoids there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where you can go back to the
original article, look some more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: description of the details of that
particular pruning method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they also mentioned or looked at
influenza sampling locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So influenza are bud sampling locations
one through five, kind of shown here on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an image of a control plant,
which basically didn't have pruning,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to give you an idea of where that
sampling may have occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trimmed influenza was dried at 24 degrees
Celsius and 55% air humidity for 14 days
[SPEAKER_00]: in an environmentally controlled chamber
in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives you an idea of their kind of
drying and curing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now light penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore the architecture of
manipulated plants can be utilized to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase yield biomass and
standardization, but the cannabinoid yield
[SPEAKER_00]: should be addressed by others.
[SPEAKER_00]: A considerable reduction of light
inception down the chute was observed and
[SPEAKER_00]: the extent of spatial standardization of
the cannabinoid profile correlated with
[SPEAKER_00]: the effect of plant architecture on light
penetration to the lower parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give a summary of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, as we see here, just an under
plant shot, not from the study,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just in random plant with lights above
it, the penetration of that light
[SPEAKER_00]: diminishes quite substantially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you get deeper into that canopy,
the light penetration becomes less and
[SPEAKER_00]: less and less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this suggests that low light
availability at the bottom of the plant or
[SPEAKER_00]: in deeply shaded regions of the plant is a
powerful inducer for reduction of those
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical standardizations, meaning those
buds that are in the shade that are
[SPEAKER_00]: further away from the lights are simply
going to yield less cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having good plant structure,
but also exposing those buds in some way
[SPEAKER_00]: to the greatest amount of intensity of
light coming down in this case was
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous to increase those cannabinoid
profiles there and standardizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the light in buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does this kind of relate to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Many growers in support of the screen of
green method highlight the idea that
[SPEAKER_00]: maximizing light exposure will improve bud
quality, which the study kind of confirms
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is support of this screen of
green method where all those buds are kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of growing on the same platform there,
the same plane, all pointing up,
[SPEAKER_00]: all getting the maximum amount of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, though, keep in mind that the
added labor and time to properly perform
[SPEAKER_00]: this screen of green method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when an operation is looking to
maximize plant growth and efficiency,
[SPEAKER_00]: the screen of green may not be the most
advantageous of pruning methods,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for those that may be with plant
restriction numbers can then grow so many
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and really it's not, the grower
doesn't have the main focus on efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: and quick turnover times.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why the screen of green method is
probably so popular with many growers
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is a way to kind of produce
more of those top quality A buds from a
[SPEAKER_00]: single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lastly, optimizing that plant
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the double prune method as stated in
this article is that allows for maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: light exposure to as many buds as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's proven to be advantageous and this
gives the idea that slightly smaller but
[SPEAKER_00]: well structured plants can be top quality
producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't necessarily need some giant
plant to have high quality, high yielding
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smaller, more manicured, better trimmed,
better pruned, better allocation of light
[SPEAKER_00]: to buds ratios can be advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we don't want to necessarily go too
small and make it a little bonsai plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but look at this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it presents some good information
that some growers may have known,
[SPEAKER_00]: but kind of gives you some scientific
background and maybe you find a new
[SPEAKER_00]: pruning method that can help increase your
yields without really having to change
[SPEAKER_00]: that much since you still understand your
strain or cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just this pruning method or that
architecture change, you could see an
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement in your yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best of luck.
