[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at blood
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you've ever had blood drawn and
put into a vial, you'll notice it's this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of dark red liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may think, oh, it transports oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually different components that
we're going to investigate further so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can develop a greater understanding of the
components that make up blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of those components, there's four major
ones we're going to focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is plasma, and that's the liquid
portion that contains dissolved nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones, and gases and comprised about
55% of the total blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red blood cells are overthrow sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones responsible for
transporting oxygen and also carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: White blood cells, or leukocytes,
are important for the body's immune
[SPEAKER_00]: system, and platelets help the body form
blood clots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it will look like after a
centrifuge, and you can see there's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely a distinctive yellow,
clearest to whitest region, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: dark red portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, blood is the body's only fluid
tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a metallic taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes from a scarlet red to a dark red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never is blood a blue color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its pH is kept at a tight range between
7.35 and 7.45.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its temperature is slightly higher than
normal body temperature, and it accounts
[SPEAKER_00]: for approximately 8% of the body's weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: For males, it's about five to six liters
of blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: For females, about four to five liters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plasma that I mentioned, that kind of
yellow portion, blood plasma contains over
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 solutes, including proteins,
non-protein nitrogenous substances,
[SPEAKER_00]: organic nutrients, electrolytes,
and respiratory gases, and is that
[SPEAKER_00]: yellowish kind of color to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it contains everything from sodium,
potassium, glucose, lactic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: clotting proteins, oxygen, carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: A whole bunch is found in blood plasma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Formed elements, so our overthrow sites,
leukocytes, and platelets make up the
[SPEAKER_00]: formed elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only white blood cells are complete cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red blood cells actually have no nuclei or
organelles, and platelets are just cell
[SPEAKER_00]: fragments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see those here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most formed elements survive in the
bloodstream only a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most blood cells do not divide,
but are renewed by cells in the bone
[SPEAKER_00]: marrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you a little kind of comparison
of what they kind of look like here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The overthrow sites are the red blood
cells, about 99% of the blood cellular
[SPEAKER_00]: component.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're biconcave discs, because this
gives them a very high surface area to
[SPEAKER_00]: volume ratio, and very important for the
nutrient as well as gas exchange that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're so needed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also an A-nucleate, which means
they lose their nucleus at maturity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and have essentially no organelles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're filled with humoglobin,
which is a protein that functions for gas
[SPEAKER_00]: transport, responsible for the red color.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they move through the circulatory
system here, they have a special protein
[SPEAKER_00]: that helps give them flexibility,
so they're able to move through the veins
[SPEAKER_00]: and the arteries quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can change shape as necessary,
but they will always kind of maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: overall that biconcave disc to allow a
high surface area to volume ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Erythrocytes are red blood cells'
lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: They live about four months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron from hemoglobin is recycled in the
liver and spleen, and the hormone
[SPEAKER_00]: erythropioton is made in the kidneys,
and it stimulates the production of red
[SPEAKER_00]: blood cells in the bone marrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: One red blood cell contains about a
billion molecules of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of some fun facts here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red blood cells take about 20 seconds to
circulate over the body one time,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they circulate for about 120 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are millions of red blood cells in
one drop of blood, and two to three
[SPEAKER_00]: million red blood cells are made each
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not gonna go too much into the
details of the lifespan, but you could see
[SPEAKER_00]: red blood cells who might be taking for
granted how many there are and the
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary function that they produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, they have about 100 to 120 day
lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Older erythrocytes become rigid and
fragile, and their hemoglobin begins to
[SPEAKER_00]: degenerate, both making them basically
non-functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the erythrocytes are engulfed by
macrophages.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when they're dying, and they're
kind of engulfed and cleaned up that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heme and globin are separated,
and the iron is salvaged for reuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the body's not just gonna engulf them
and completely break them apart and throw
[SPEAKER_00]: them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna use some of the components.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to remember that red blood
cells do not grow, do not divide,
[SPEAKER_00]: and do not make any new proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myoglobin is a protein found in muscle
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see here, our darker red meat
contains a greater amount of myoglobin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They provide oxygen to active muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very similar to something you might
be more familiar with called hemoglobin,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it binds to oxygen tighter than
hemoglobin, as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our pressure in millimeters of
mercury, and we see our myoglobin shoots
[SPEAKER_00]: up very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it binds to oxygen tighter than
hemoglobin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll notice here are two different types
of hemoglobin.
[SPEAKER_00]: HF is referring to fetal hemoglobin,
which is a little more efficient at
[SPEAKER_00]: binding oxygen than adult hemoglobin here,
but all perform the same basic function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking specifically at hemoglobin,
it's a complex protein made up of four
[SPEAKER_00]: protein strands, these different peptide
chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron is used to form the heme groups,
and that's what's responsible for the
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a protein, shape is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, pH will also impact the
ability for hemoglobin to be able to bind
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's 7.4, and here's 7.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: A decrease in pH causes a greater release
of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at 7.4, hemoglobin's more efficient at
binding oxygen than at pH 7.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Platelets, as I mentioned, are fragments,
and they do not contain a nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grains, they basically function for the
clotting purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see this kind of like web here that
forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mechanism by forming temporary plug
that helps seal breaks in blood vessels.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also play a key role in the formation
of fibrin and fibrinogen, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for that kind of webbing,
and that's what's helping block the trap
[SPEAKER_00]: the red blood cells in here, preventing
continuous bleeding from occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of shows a little pictorial here of a
damaged blood vessel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Injury, here's our red blood cells
leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Activated platelets start to bind and kind
of make a little plug here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we see our fibrin strands
carrying that netting, really kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: sealing that area off from the red blood
cells escaping, as well as from potential
[SPEAKER_00]: invaders from the outside of the body
getting into the body in the bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two different types of anemias.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hemorrhagic anemia, which is the
result of acute or chronic blood loss,
[SPEAKER_00]: and both of these are insufficient red
blood cells or hemoglobin in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could have that insufficient by
just simply losing a lot of blood or
[SPEAKER_00]: having an iron deficiency, which is a
secondary result of hemorrhagic anemia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inadequate intake of iron-containing foods
can also contribute to this, and impaired
[SPEAKER_00]: iron absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see our normal levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our storage and our transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have an iron depletion,
and then we have iron deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if iron-deficient anemia, as we notice
that transport and functional iron
[SPEAKER_00]: decreases at a much greater rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see the suggested rates for
grams per liter for females and males,
[SPEAKER_00]: close typically needed a little bit more
for males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our progressive of iron
depletion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a much worse case than here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sickle cell anemia, you may have heard of
that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where red blood cells basically lose
their biconcave disc shape and cause this
[SPEAKER_00]: sickle shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a defective gene encoding for
abnormal hemoglobin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a single amino acid substitution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could see our normal protein being
made here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a single amino acid
substitution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resulting in a mutant amino acid causing
in a mutant protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its shape has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The defect caused red blood cells have
that sickle shape and low oxygen absorbing
[SPEAKER_00]: qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also this sickle shape does not allow
it to free flow through the veins and
[SPEAKER_00]: arteries as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we have the ABO blood groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is referring to group A has A
antigens, group B has B antigens,
[SPEAKER_00]: group AB has A and B antigens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And group O has no antigens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is used to classify blood types.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where people may say they're AB or
AB or O types.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also could be A positive or B
positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That refers to RH factors, which stands
for resist factors there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives you a general overview of
the blood and the different components
[SPEAKER_00]: that it contains.
Thanks for watching.
