[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tobacco University Student Series
video, we're going to see cloning from a
[SPEAKER_00]: damaged plant so it can live on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see two plants that have
endured some physical damage, and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take some clones from them that
we may not have considered otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one that damaged the top,
so we're going to kind of top that one and
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize that plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one in the image here that fell over,
we're going to see just how many clones
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get from a branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while they may not all root,
at least taking them and giving them a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to root would be encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're encouraged because this is a great
way to continue those genetics on a
[SPEAKER_00]: situation that might be a little
unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this CBD plant was unfortunately
trampled by a mixture of both people and
[SPEAKER_01]: bunnies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we want to be able to salvage
anything we can from this so that we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: just lose the entirety of what was damaged
by people and by animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically, like I said, you want your
plant size to be about a hand,
[SPEAKER_01]: but due to the damage that it's endured,
we can't really take the snipping right at
[SPEAKER_01]: the node.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want it to be a healthy, somewhat
healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so instead, we're going to cut it
above the node, still pretty close,
[SPEAKER_01]: but above so that there's no damage in
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now hopefully we could take what's left
of this damaged plant and repurpose it
[SPEAKER_01]: into a new, hopefully healthy plant and
allow this plant that has been damaged to
[SPEAKER_01]: take less stress off of trying to fix the
damage on top and put its nutrients into
[SPEAKER_01]: the rest of the leaf so that hopefully it
can recover from this injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately, this plant endured a bit
too much physical damage and has been
[SPEAKER_01]: unrooted from the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, at this rate, we're not going to get
any yield from this plant since it
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously isn't growing, but we've put so
much effort into it already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what else can we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: We could take clones, many clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, many people would see this plant and
think, okay, I killed my cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's over.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to show you just how many
clones you could take from a dead cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to want to cut from the
nodes always and try to get ones that have
[SPEAKER_01]: long stalks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
[SPEAKER_01]: 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: By now I think you get the point and
realize that even though this may be a
[SPEAKER_01]: dead cannabis plant, there are many
possibilities that you could choose to
[SPEAKER_01]: revive it and move on from this damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
