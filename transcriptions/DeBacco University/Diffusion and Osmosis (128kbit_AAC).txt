[SPEAKER_00]: Diffusion and osmosis, two very important
concepts to understand and to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: distinguish the difference between the
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick summary is diffusion is movement of
particles from a high concentration to a
[SPEAKER_00]: lower concentration to make it evenly
spaced out here, and osmosis is the
[SPEAKER_00]: movement or change of water through a
semi-permeable membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's dive in more detail here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with diffusion, so diffusion,
here we have a bunch of blue molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: here, our extracellular space,
they're diffusing across our
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-permeable lipid bilayer, and over
time they become evenly distributed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside and inside of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here our little tan spheres
here, slowly diffusing throughout these
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules become more evenly spaced out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the net movement of a substance
from an area of higher concentration to an
[SPEAKER_00]: area of lower concentration down a
concentration gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So high concentration to low
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could think of this if you're going
to go watch a movie and you're waiting to
[SPEAKER_00]: get into the movie theater, they have the
doors closed, you have a very high
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration, and you're passing through
the doorway here, ultimately getting an
[SPEAKER_00]: even amount of, hopefully, that are on the
inside and on the outside there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can be a way of everyone that's in
the movie theater and those that are still
[SPEAKER_00]: outside waiting for other movies to come
on, that could be a way to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: this diffusion process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part here is it's a selectively
permeable lipid layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this diffusion process, it can be
simple, channeled, or carrier-mediated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general process is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Channel and carrier-mediated diffusion is
specific and subject to saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what these two require is this protein
channel, for example, or this carrier
[SPEAKER_00]: protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple diffusion just occurs with no
energy and it just kind of happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to think about simple diffusion,
if someone sprays perfume in one side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the room, eventually it'll work its way
all the way over to the other side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Channel or carrier-mediated involves these
carrier proteins, and we're looking more
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically at a cellular example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, specific to size, charge,
and interactions with the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So example, this channel is transferring
these small green molecules and not these
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter oval-shaped ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very specific to just these types of
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: This other carrier protein is specific to
the lighter green oval-shaped ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: What means, when I say subject to
saturation, making channels very limiting,
[SPEAKER_00]: is if there's only a couple of these
proteins in the plasma membrane,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna limit and there's only gonna be
so many that can get through it in one
[SPEAKER_00]: particular time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subject to saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're all busy doing their job,
it's gonna be slow to get all those
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules to diffuse across.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're looking at that saturation
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not a lot of solutes, then they
can all diffuse quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So diffusion in solutions, all molecules
are constantly in motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, only at absolute zero are things
not moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to reach absolute zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molecules in solution move randomly,
and the random motion causes the mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentration is the amount of solute in a
solvent, and concentration gradient is the
[SPEAKER_00]: more solute in one part than another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a drop of dye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, it's very concentrated slowly over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It diffuses without any mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The simple moving of those molecules
around caused that dye to get moved around
[SPEAKER_00]: to mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dye crystals, in this case, are at the
bottom, and they're getting evenly mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we heat up, in this case,
if this is water, if we heat up the water,
[SPEAKER_00]: this can occur at a faster rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diffusion in solutions, our solutes move
down the concentration gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molecules mix randomly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solute spreads throughout the solvent and
eliminates concentration gradients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we have a concentration gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, we have basically an equal
amount on both the left and right side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this occurs just through the movement
of the water molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Factors affecting our diffusion rates,
you can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distance to particle has to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to our example of the
perfume, if it's a very large room,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to take a longer time for those
further away in the room to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: smell the perfume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molecule size, the small molecules will
move faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big molecules take a lot of energy to
move, and they can be a lot slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small molecules move a lot faster and
diffuse a lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature, as we mentioned before,
more heat, faster the motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gradient size, the difference between high
and low concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the greater the difference,
in this case, the more concentrated the
[SPEAKER_00]: dye is, that's going to affect our
diffusion rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the difference between high and
low concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's very dilute, it's going to take a
little bit longer for it to kind of work
[SPEAKER_00]: its way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And electrical forces, opposites attract,
light charges repel if we're dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's positive and negative
charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So diffusion across the membrane,
each solute diffuses down its own
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a net diffusion of purple
molecules towards the left in the example
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see they're moving towards the
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the solute that was initially
greater on the left side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have 20% solute, 10% solute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the movement, in this case,
is going to be moving to the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: This leads to dynamic equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the solute molecules continue
to cross membrane, but at equal rates in
[SPEAKER_00]: both directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at equilibrium, I don't want you to
think things stop moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: The molecules are still moving,
but for every one that moves to the left,
[SPEAKER_00]: one moves to the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no net change.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is dynamic equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: No net change in the amount of purple
molecules on the left and right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though one might be moving to the
left, one moves to the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with the water molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: One moves to the right, one moves to the
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still things that are moving,
but the net effect is zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Facilitated diffusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This diffusion of size through a
semi-purple membrane with the help of
[SPEAKER_00]: special transport proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large polar molecules and ions cannot pass
through the phospholipid bilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They require these proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the facilitated diffusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, teachers were called faculty,
and we're facilitating, this is where
[SPEAKER_00]: faculty comes through, we're facilitating
your learning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you need a little extra help,
we are like the carrier proteins in the
[SPEAKER_00]: phospholipid bilayer, helping move this
confusing amount of information randomly
[SPEAKER_00]: around through and getting it ideally to
you where you can learn it and then use it
[SPEAKER_00]: for your own future studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Facilitated diffusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two types of transport proteins here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help ions and large polar molecules
diffuse through cell membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Channel proteins provide a narrow channel
for the substances to pass through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Care proteins physically bind to one side
of the membrane and release it on the
[SPEAKER_00]: other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here, here's our binding
that's occurring, carrying it through and
[SPEAKER_00]: transporting it to this side.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of our channel
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simply just a channel, allowing these
red molecules to be able to pass through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carrier proteins are physically grabbing
and carrying them across from one side to
[SPEAKER_00]: the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of a channel protein
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last part of our facilitated
diffusion, it's specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each channel is specific to transport
certain ions or molecules only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Passive direction of net movement is
always down the concentration gradient and
[SPEAKER_00]: saturates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once all transport proteins are in use,
the rate of diffusion can no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: increase beyond that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming it's very specifically helping
students, it's passive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's down always the concentration
gradient from an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher concentration to lower and
saturates.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the transport proteins are in use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's as quick as the rate can go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all the teachers are busy helping
students, that's as quick as we can help
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Osmosis, a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diffusion of solvent across the
semipermeable membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: In living systems, the solvent is always
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So osmosis basically diffusion of water
across the semipermeable membrane here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, that got cut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have the amount of molecules on
the left and right staying the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we have the amount of water shifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water is trying to make the
concentration of each equal, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't pass through this particular
semipermeable membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Osmosis, again, that movement of water in
this case for biological systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: more solid molecules, lower concentration
of water molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: The membrane must be semipermeable to
water and selectively permeable to the
[SPEAKER_00]: solutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the solutes can't move.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the water can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water molecules diffuse across the
membrane towards the solution with more
[SPEAKER_00]: solutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The volume increases on the side with more
solutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here, here's some more solutes,
here's less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water's gonna move across, because in this
case, the dissolved salt cannot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see an increase in the height of water
in this tube versus this side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing here, we have more molecules on
this side and over time, we get to part
[SPEAKER_00]: two, more water moves across.
[SPEAKER_00]: So diffusion and osmosis, a great
combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: In comparison between the two here,
think of dimolecules simply spreading out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Osmosis is the movement of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, an important concept, concentration
gradients tend to even out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the absence of a membrane, diffusion
eliminates concentration gradients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, it evenly distributes a homogeneous
mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: When different solute concentrations exist
on either side of the selectively
[SPEAKER_00]: permeable membrane, osmosis moves water
through the membrane to equalize the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration gradients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case here, we have our equal
amounts of blue and yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're causing this mixing to occur
and we're getting green here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shows here, different water heights again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to make the same number of
molecules per area on both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, we reduce the water and it
moves over to this side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're just equally spacing things
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like students when they enter a
room, they all equally space out over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're keeping the same number of
students on the left and the right side
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're simply giving these students a
bigger room and it's a smaller room to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the amount of area or square footage
that a student may have equal in both
[SPEAKER_00]: cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, that was helpful in describing
the difference in similarities between
[SPEAKER_00]: diffusion and osmosis and how it relates
to biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
