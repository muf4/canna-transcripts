[SPEAKER_00]: This video lecture is going to be looking
at calculating the time of bullet travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we think that they may travel very
fast, which they do, we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to calculate that time as well as
some of the distance and velocity with the
[SPEAKER_00]: equation I'm going to provide you with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with time from the shooter to
the target.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the time equation is t equals d over
v, or time, which is represented by t in
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds, equals distance d in meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that the units must be
matching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this example, the distance was
measured in meters, so the velocity was in
[SPEAKER_00]: meters per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows us then to be able to
calculate the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at that same equation that
doesn't change here, a simple example,
[SPEAKER_00]: a bullet traveled in a straight line,
we're assuming, 30 meters, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: velocity was 27 meters per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, what's the time that
the bullet spent traveling that distance
[SPEAKER_00]: at that speed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how long did this take?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we go through and kind of calculate
this out, the simplified example here,
[SPEAKER_00]: how long did it take?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the answer would be 1.1 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how did I get that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I take the distance, which would be 30,
and divide it by 27, and that would get
[SPEAKER_00]: you 1.1 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now continuing this same idea and the same
concept and the exact same equation I
[SPEAKER_00]: provided you with, right over here,
I give you three examples to work on this
[SPEAKER_00]: type of equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the time of travel if the
bullet goes 100 meters at a rate of 540
[SPEAKER_00]: meters per second?
[SPEAKER_00]: Second example is what's the distance of
travel if the bullet was in the air for
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.5 seconds?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of give you quote t in this
case, traveling at 400 meters per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the velocity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case, you have to solve for d.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you need to solve for v.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the velocity of travel if the
bullet that was in the air for 0.7 seconds
[SPEAKER_00]: and traveled 25 meters?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the velocity?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is just kind of working
with this equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just you pause the video here,
take a piece of scrap paper out,
[SPEAKER_00]: and solve for these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be revealing the answers,
so hopefully you've solved for those,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least this is a fair warning if you
don't want to know the answers quite yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have the answers provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are provided up here in kind of a
breakdown of how I set up that equation
[SPEAKER_00]: located below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those were kind of basic examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone through here and I've developed
what I call challenge examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what makes them challenging is not
that the equations changed by any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still solving the same equation for
time, distance, and velocity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here you may have to change the units
you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, here I give you feet per
second and I give you yards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I give you miles per hour and
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking for the velocity if I'm
giving you feet in seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this just might require a little
bit of some unit conversions to keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what makes these a little bit
of a challenge examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, pause the video here,
solve them because I'm about to reveal the
[SPEAKER_00]: answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair warning, I'm revealing the answers
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could again see the answers
provided as well with the kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: basic two-step potential conversions you
may need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you got these answers and able
to understand these kind of basic ways for
[SPEAKER_00]: calculating time of the bullet travel.
