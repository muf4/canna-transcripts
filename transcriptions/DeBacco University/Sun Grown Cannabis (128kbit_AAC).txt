[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to talk about sun-grown
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking to learn more about
sun-grown cannabis, let's get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: video lecture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, sun-grown cannabis is really
just outdoor-grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a term that's been given to the
outdoor-grown cannabis that's being
[SPEAKER_00]: produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, sun-grown is intended to imply
that there's a greater focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun-grown does not have an exact
definition, though, and it implies that
[SPEAKER_00]: the sun is the main source of light or
energy and not electrical power.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea behind this term is that the
cannabis has been farmed sustainably,
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy, and in natural environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what this term is meant
to mean, even though there's not an exact
[SPEAKER_00]: current definition for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why indoor-grown in the first place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is there such a thing as indoor-grown
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because indoor cultivation of
cannabis is simply due to the prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis forcing growers to grow in
isolated, private locations that were
[SPEAKER_00]: typically in an indoor area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This caused technologies to be developed
to allow for this type of propagation,
[SPEAKER_00]: which increased the dependency on
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an estimated 3% of California's
household energy use is due simply to the
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, sun-grown, we're utilizing that
sun, reducing the amount of energy needed
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly for lights that can also
relate to heat as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cost of replicating the sun's energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on a national level in 2011,
it was estimated that the energy
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption for indoor cannabis consumes
1% of the national electric usage,
[SPEAKER_00]: or about $6 billion per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's according to the source located right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This equates to the production of carbon
emissions equal to that of three million
[SPEAKER_00]: average US cars for every one kilogram of
indoor cannabis produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, this is what caused the
outdoor or sun-grown movement to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce some of this production of energy
when we have the natural sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sun-grown's energy savings is that with
outdoor production, this can nearly
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminate the energy needed for the
growing of cannabis, which reduces the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental impacts and also the cost to
the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great thing where you can
utilize natural resources and when we have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to the sun, well, that's a great
savings there and also environmentally
[SPEAKER_00]: friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to savings, growers often use
organic products, local water and that
[SPEAKER_00]: natural sunlight there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reducing costs while hopefully
maintaining good yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun-grown advantage states that
potencies can be achieved when best
[SPEAKER_00]: practices are used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's the source, you can find it in
the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is supported by the statement that
sun-grown diverges from outdoor because it
[SPEAKER_00]: adheres to the use of organic practices
and fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sun-grown cannabis also carries a
myriad of environmental benefits due to
[SPEAKER_00]: avoiding the use of harsh and artificial
additives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where that term sun-grown is
being utilized to distinguish it just from
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though the plants are grown outdoors,
that sun-grown label is implying that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a more focus by the grower to
sustainable practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the limitations of sun-grown
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with the variability of the outdoor
environment, these variable conditions can
[SPEAKER_00]: cause stresses on the plant and reduce
overall production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Equipment used to reduce some of these
impacts can reduce the overall carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: footprint efficiency of a growing
operation, but often will help increase
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers can be caught in that kind of
limbo, where if they're going to implement
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of practices that may help
reduce or buffer some of these stresses,
[SPEAKER_00]: they may be also adding more carbon,
which is what they're trying to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: with the idea behind sun-grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, the seasonality of different
regions can also limit the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing cycles that can be completed
within a calendar year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can be limiting as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, sun-grown anecdotal accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people will say, well, sun-grown will
produce increased potency, improved plant
[SPEAKER_00]: health, more aromas, wider terpene
profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, these are more anecdotal and
not necessarily confirmed on scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: lab tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun spectrum advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one thing that we can agree on is
that there has been lighting studies that
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrate that there's improved plant
performance with UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also far-red light wavelengths,
as these do contribute to the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of these are produced naturally
in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this may be true, other stresses
typically reduce the overall quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we're getting a better spectrum,
that full kind of sun spectrum,
[SPEAKER_00]: there could be other stresses such as
temperature, humidity, rain events,
[SPEAKER_00]: fluctuations and inconsistencies,
and kind of moderation of temperature as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, the duration of sun spectrum,
all of those can be kind of play into the
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in the overall quality of the
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lastly, what's the goal for sun-grown
growers is that their goal of those
[SPEAKER_00]: growers is selecting to follow the
practices of sun-grown will have less
[SPEAKER_00]: overall costs compared to indoor
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the final product quality may be
a battle and not often one compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sun-grown growers goals should be
focused on sustainable practices and total
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to the reduced cost per plant,
growers can often grow more plants and win
[SPEAKER_00]: the biomass production game compared to
those indoor growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, growing a product for final dry
flower will meet stiff competition from
[SPEAKER_00]: the indoor market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers should be considering some form
of extraction for their product if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at growing the sun-grown route.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply with the lack of need of energy
inputs, for example, for lighting for the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic process, typically these
growers, if they have the land can produce
[SPEAKER_00]: more biomass, can produce more plants
because of the reduced cost overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully make up the difference with
extraction simply by the increased number
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants compared to those indoor
growers, which need to have maximum yield
[SPEAKER_00]: because they have a lot of inputs and
upfront costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this provides you just a
little idea of what sun-grown cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: all about.
