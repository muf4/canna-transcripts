[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, in this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over fertilizers to use
[SPEAKER_00]: with coco coir for indoor cannabis plant
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're choosing to grow in coco coir,
you should be aware of certain fertilizers
[SPEAKER_00]: to use, and in this video, I'm going to
cover just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into some of the specific
fertilizers to use if you're deciding to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow your cannabis in coco coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, coco coir has some special
requirements, and that's why you'll see,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we saw in the beginning slide,
some companies specifically make nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: lines for those growing purely in coco
coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: When growing in coco coir, there are some
special methods of fertilizing that
[SPEAKER_00]: growers should be keeping in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: While some companies manufacture coco
coir-specific fertilizers, growers need to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep in mind a few key items that you
don't necessarily need to go out and buy
[SPEAKER_00]: that specific fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others can work, but you need to be aware
of some unique requirements if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: choosing to grow in coco coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, in coco coir, typically,
growers will be doing frequent feedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a system that allows for easy
and consistent delivery of nutrients is
[SPEAKER_00]: highly recommended because coco coir has
some great properties from a morphology or
[SPEAKER_00]: plant structure standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to be irrigating quite a bit,
usually daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually good to mix in some
fertilizer with those frequent irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: events as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to neglect the basic macro
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to get caught up in all the
little details.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be aware that plants still
need to be fed the macronutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium,
the NPK mentioned here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cannot be forgotten about to avoid
common nutrient deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many times, people who grow in coco
coir get caught up in purely the
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients or some of the secondary
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not forget about the macronutrients as
well, and they'll be listed in any
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer container or label.
[SPEAKER_00]: When growing in coco coir, I put the
question here, got CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: For growing in coco coir, you need to make
sure you also have sufficient CalMag
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer on hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many companies offer a CalMag product,
but based on personally collected tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: test results, the Botanicares CalMag Plus
gets my recommendation, though there are
[SPEAKER_00]: many other options out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have used the CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have tissue tests that confirm it
will increase plant levels of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the one I choose to use
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sponsored by them by any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron is also needed with coco coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers suggest that iron deficiency
can also occur with greater frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the coco coir substrate, while this
may be possible, calcium deficiencies are
[SPEAKER_00]: usually more common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Botanicares CalMag Plus also has
iron in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another plus to be using that
product in the sense that it should cure
[SPEAKER_00]: any potential deficiencies you would get
by growing in coco coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with any fertilizer, so this is true
if you're growing in coco coir or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: When mixing any fertilizers, they should
be initially mixed in a clear jar to see
[SPEAKER_00]: if any unexpected reactions or what's
called precipitation occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium based fertilizers seem to be more
likely to react.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are going to be mixing other
fertilizers, please follow the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer's suggestions and also
perform a test before you make an
[SPEAKER_00]: application to your plants to avoid any
potential negative impacts that could
[SPEAKER_00]: cause phytotoxicity or leaf burn or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to do a little jar mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix it up ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it stays mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you don't get any particpate
that falls out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always check the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always good to see if it coagulates over
time with any fertilizer that you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perform a jar test to make sure that if
you find any negative interaction,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure they occur in the jar and not on
your plants.
