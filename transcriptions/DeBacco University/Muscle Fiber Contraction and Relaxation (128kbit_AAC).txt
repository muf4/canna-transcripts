[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is going to go over muscle
fiber contraction and relaxation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, contraction is what's going on
here where we're bringing all our muscles
[SPEAKER_00]: together, and relaxation is kind of the
opposite effect of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while this is going to focus on what
happens for the muscle fiber, this is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be, if you haven't had exposure,
a little bit of an introductory to the
[SPEAKER_00]: nervous system and how neurons interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go through this process,
and I'm going to kind of build on the
[SPEAKER_00]: images here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're welcome to pause the video if
you want to read what's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to help explain this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with muscle fiber contraction
sequence, it's a series of steps here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at step one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The neurotransmitter, ACH, which is
acetylcholine, is released from the axon
[SPEAKER_00]: terminal, binds the receptors on the
sarcoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So our axon, which is our nervous system,
is releasing a neurotransmitter,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, our proteins have a very
specific binding that's occurring,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what we're noticing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may remember, if you've had a nervous
system before, this gap here is called a
[SPEAKER_00]: synapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our neurotransmitter being
released and binding here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So acetylcholine's being released and
binding to the receptors here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, this is what's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Building on from that, the action
potential is generated and travels down
[SPEAKER_00]: the T-tubule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this binding that occurs is now
generating an action potential,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's traveling along this structure
called a T-tubule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here's our axon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going through, we're releasing our
neurotransmitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's binding to the proteins here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this signal, this action potential
signal, is being transmitted to a
[SPEAKER_00]: structure called the T-tubule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium ions now are very important in
this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So calcium ions here are released from
storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum,
[SPEAKER_00]: abbreviated SR, in response to the change
in voltage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we said that action potential comes
here down the T-tubule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now that we have that voltage
change, calcium is being released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium is typically related with this
plus two charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the charge that it takes on,
and that's being released here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the same thing going on in this
image, where we have the binding of the
[SPEAKER_00]: neurotransmitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a change in voltage, and now we
have a release of calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the calcium binds to tropin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cross-bridges form between actin and
myosin, resulting in a muscle contraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our actin thin filaments,
and here's our myosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as calcium ions remain in the
sarcoplasm to bind to tropin, and as long
[SPEAKER_00]: as ATP is available, as long as these two
conditions do exist, the muscle fiber will
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to shorten.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that is, is that sliding
filament, we have our muscle contraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: A muscle can stop contracting,
though, when it either runs out of ATP,
[SPEAKER_00]: and or becomes fatigued.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have a video on the sliding filament
theory, which will go over some more of
[SPEAKER_00]: this in greater detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that calcium ion release, you notice
that release is causing the sarcoplasm to
[SPEAKER_00]: bind to tropin, and as long as ATP is
available, our muscle fiber will go from
[SPEAKER_00]: this stage, and it will shorten to the
sliding filaments, and it will result in
[SPEAKER_00]: this shape here, causing contraction to
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind, that was contraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at the relaxation phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This acetylcholesterase, sorry,
acetylcholesterase, A-C-H-E is a protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it removes acetylcholine from the
synaptic cleft.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of like the opposite here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our acetylcholine, little red dots,
and here's our acetylcholinesterase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acetylcholinesterase is the protein
represented by the blue molecule here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening is that's binding,
that's removing the acetylcholine from the
[SPEAKER_00]: synaptic cleft.
[SPEAKER_00]: That removal of that is stopping the
signal from occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium ions are transported back into the
sarcoplasmic reticulum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice they're returning back here to be
stored because they're no longer having
[SPEAKER_00]: the voltage change down the T tubulo,
so they're going back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, tropomyosin binds, let's look over
here, binds to active sites on the actin,
[SPEAKER_00]: causing the cross bridge to detach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice we now have a lack of a
cross bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have a lack of calcium,
which is because of our binding up of
[SPEAKER_00]: acetylcholine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of the opposite effect here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is that relaxation phase,
very different than the contraction phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this does involve a little bit of
neurotransmitters and a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction to the nervous system,
but it is very important when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the contraction of muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend you watch my sliding
filament theory video lecture also to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand a little bit more about what's
going on with the contraction process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
I'll see you next time.
