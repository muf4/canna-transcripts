[SPEAKER_00]: So a question many growers are asking,
how can I prevent hoplite and virid from
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading?
[SPEAKER_00]: In this debarking and diversity video,
we'll go through on how to answer this
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so if you're wondering how you can
prevent hoplite and virid from spreading,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the video for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just some additional resources you
might want to consider in addition to this
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one presentation provided here as
well as a little bit of a podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: interview style, additional resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these links can be found in the
description of this video under the
[SPEAKER_00]: references and work cited portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you prevent it from spreading?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it all starts with knowing what you
have and having a good testing and
[SPEAKER_00]: screening protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't mean just testing a couple
plants in your entire operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been testing all of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of grower friendly kits are
available, but this reliant on you to be
[SPEAKER_00]: very organized, be very good with your
labeling and essentially establishing or
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing what you have is the good start to
end any process to prevent something from
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're sending samples off to get
tested, what should you be doing while
[SPEAKER_00]: you're waiting for those results to come
back?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just good growing practices in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adhering to strict and consistent tool
sterilization processes is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPE for workers, having masks and hoodies
and gloves and booties for the shoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: all good things you should be implementing
in your indoor grow operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rigorous testing protocols, repeat
testing, particularly of the mother room,
[SPEAKER_00]: if not your other rooms as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But definitely if you're going to pare
down to one area, focus definitely on the
[SPEAKER_00]: mother room, especially if you're taking
clones from those, you want to ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: those clones are going to be viroid free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, initially you might want to take more
plants in the bedroom as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if one is infected, it can easily
infect others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the obvious is plant eradication.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we go about eliminating this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you eliminate the host,
essentially eliminate the viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Removing plants that test positive,
removing them and followed by a continual
[SPEAKER_00]: testing can reduce the presence of hoplite
and viroid in a growing operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's just an example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting with, you know,
a lot of plants and slowly over time,
[SPEAKER_00]: that trend is going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Removing those infected plants is really
key and important.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be higher numbers to start with,
but in the long run, it will save you a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of frustration and kind of stop this
hopefully from fighting it on a continual
[SPEAKER_00]: basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Identify there's few plants, get rid of
those, ensure others are also testing
[SPEAKER_00]: clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat testing is also important to help
keep ensuring you're reducing those
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, cleaning tools and surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds great to any good sanitation
protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be done on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the product you select as your
cleaner may make the area look clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: but may not have an impact on hoplite and
viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers don't know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are some methods that are great
looking in area cleaning or sterilization
[SPEAKER_00]: that really are not effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: These do not work on hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work for other things such as
bacteria or more living things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not the viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use alcohol, even 99% isopropyl,
that's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol and then flame, that's not going
to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just flaming tools with high heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid or,
you know, the acid and vinegar,
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonium cleaner such as Lysol,
UV light, UVC exposure, on the leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: roots for five minutes, the viroid is
still present.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these are ineffective methods if
you're looking at targeting a viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this leads to the question,
well, what would be viable?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does work?
[SPEAKER_00]: At least on tools and surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not cleaning plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's even more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Furcon asked 2%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Household bleach in the 10 to 20% range
for 30 to 60 seconds is also effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common lab saying that was in the lab and
working, it was 10% bleach for 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though if you are using bleach or really
any of these, you want to mix and use them
[SPEAKER_00]: the same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them to sit for a long
duration of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their effectiveness does wane or just get
reduced over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So household bleach and this Furcon asked
two ones that are effective compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: all the lists.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the other ones that many people think
are effective, but not for a viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the same cannot be applied to the root
or actually plant tissue itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Previous products or recommendations are
for tools and surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are effective in those
situations are not effective at cleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: actual plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you think you're going to like,
I've got some infected roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me dip them in bleach or do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really going to clean the plant
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only going to affect the sap that's
kind of on the bench, on the tools,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the working surface there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to clean plant with these
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: UVC radiation, this is effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: UVC radiation on the hot plate and viroid,
stability in roots and leaves are very
[SPEAKER_00]: stable in plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes it very hard to clean the plant
material or rid the area of that viroid,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is why it should be bagged and
physically removed from the location.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to, oh, here's an
infected plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me hit it with a lot of UV light and
then remove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you want to kind of put a bag
carefully over it and you want to seal it
[SPEAKER_00]: up, minimizing your contact with that
plant, keeping it in the bag, sealing the
[SPEAKER_00]: bag up and then physically removing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shortest route possible for this
dumpster possible to get it out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sap again is much more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best method for sap containing virus
may be nucleases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something used in a lab to
basically disrupt DNA or RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this viroid is RNA based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this might be one way to kind of use
this to go through and clean the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind, these can be much of a
concern because particularly ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: alter DNA, you have DNA in your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be mindful of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a laboratory approach that is
showing some early indications of
[SPEAKER_00]: potential effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, its application to actual plants,
actively growing plants in a growing
[SPEAKER_00]: operation, still yet to be well
established or understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it may work in a lab setting,
this might work for a potential tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture operation, but not really for an
established plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That careful identify, bag, tag and remove
would be what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that continual screening is the core
of any good protocol to reduce the spread
[SPEAKER_00]: of hoplite and viroid.
So thank you very much for listening.
Thank you.
Thank you.
