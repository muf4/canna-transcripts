[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we are going through and thinking
about cloning a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain tools of the trade that
you need to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to use the right tool for the
right job, and here's a couple outlined
[SPEAKER_00]: here that I'm going to go into in a little
bit of detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So healthy mother plant, sharp knife,
reading hormone media, sterilization
[SPEAKER_00]: solution, high humidity, lights,
and clean conditions are all things you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to have in place if you're going to
go through the cloning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting first with a healthy mother
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So healthy mother plants are very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the stock plant is in poor health,
it will directly result in poor clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: could reduce the percentage that will
actually root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, cutting has to go into a high
stress environment, so we want to ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: that it produces roots that it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need the mother plant of the stock
plant here to be in peak health so that
[SPEAKER_00]: the stress that the clones or the tips are
going to go through will be able to not
[SPEAKER_00]: only survive that but go through and
actually produce roots in a healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: subsequent plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a sharp knife, so provide the
clean cut to allow for efficient water
[SPEAKER_00]: transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scissors are not advised since this will
crush the vascular system, so it can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: sharp pocket knife.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to necessarily be a
scalpel, but think about it if you put
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers in a vase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a nice clean cut to allow water
to transpire through and easily enter the
[SPEAKER_00]: inner vascular system of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding hormone, it could be a gel or
powder that contains oxen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clonix gel is the best I've personally
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see kind of an evident here of
these two root nodes have gotten treated
[SPEAKER_00]: with Clonix gel, and you can see the large
roots, and then these have not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still see the presence of roots
here and here, but not nearly to the
[SPEAKER_00]: extent of those that were treated with the
hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, hormones can have a great impact
in increasing the ability for a plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Media, often Rockwell, but there's other
options such as growing media can be just
[SPEAKER_00]: as effective for cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding heat mat can help ensure or
encourage the rooting in the root zone
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see some cubes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that Rockwell is kind of made
out of that almost spongy like material,
[SPEAKER_00]: but adding a little heat mat can help
increase the heat to some extent of the
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone, encouraging a quicker rooting
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sterilization solution, isopropyl alcohol
is one example to keep every part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: process clean and disease free as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cleaning tools such as the knife is
important to repeat so that the odds of
[SPEAKER_00]: transferring disease is reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this means is you want these clean
sterile conditions for the entire process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't clean the knife at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a bunch of clothes from 20 different
plants and then clean the knife at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be repeating the cleaning
process, the sterilization process,
[SPEAKER_00]: in between maybe different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even if you're working on a large
plant, even as you take multiple cuttings,
[SPEAKER_00]: go through that process again to reduce
your chance of spreading disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: High humidity environment, humidity dome
or chamber can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: This reduces the stress on the recent
cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see how they look in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That nice humidity dome, they're being
sucked into media here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're under a lot of stress because they
lack roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That high humidity will help prevent or
reduce the chance of these plants burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights to use, they should be run at
18 to 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluorescents are often preferred by some
due to their soft light and low heat
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: CMHs or ceramic metal halides can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can cover the same area as a
fluorescent, but require only one bulb and
[SPEAKER_00]: last longer than fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs can also be well suited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full spectrum, they're low heat,
low power consumption, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for this purpose, it can be cost
prohibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, most people using
fluorescents, ceramic metal halides might
[SPEAKER_00]: be replacing those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And LEDs would be great, but often too
expensive to justify for this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want clean conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless of the entire process,
not just the knife and sterilization of
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you want clean conditions overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is often underestimated because of
the high plant density.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one plant gets sick, it can quickly
spread to other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the area before, during,
and after cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to make sure, again,
that the tray is, the media, the tags,
[SPEAKER_00]: the area they're placed in, the windy
domes, everything is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ideally, close to sterile as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tools of the trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quick summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a healthy mother plant,
very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sharp, clean knife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rooting hormone can be gel or powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Media, often Rockwell, but other options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sterilization solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean conditions at high humidity and some
form of lighting run at 18 to 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this will help you work through
and know they have the proper tools of the
[SPEAKER_00]: trade for cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
