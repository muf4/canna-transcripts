[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this video is going to look at skin
color and what kind of makes up the
[SPEAKER_00]: pigmentation for the different skin colors
that we see depicted here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, looking first at skin color and the
pigments, there's three main ones we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one is melanin, and this is the most
important, provides UV protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's a delicate balance between
being protected from UV light and being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to synthesize vitamin D.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a separate video that handles light
versus vitamin D, and you're welcome to
[SPEAKER_00]: check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second type of skin pigment is
keratin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is provided from our diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carrots, yellow vegetables, tomatoes,
these have a lot of keratin in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carrots, for example, beta keratin you may
have heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemoglobin is the last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the pink of light skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caucasian skin contains little melanin,
and it's actually some of the hemoglobin
[SPEAKER_00]: that's coming through that's giving the
skin its color or appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we're looking at a map of the world
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see different regions of the
world tie in with the skin color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in those areas that tend to be
higher intensities of sun, where there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: large population, tend to have darker skin
colors than at the North Pole,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, here, where there tends to be
less intense sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we could see that there's definitely
correlation here, particularly in Africa
[SPEAKER_00]: and Australia, with the skin tone,
the chromatic scale, and the relation to
[SPEAKER_00]: the equator, or the intensity of sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think this has a genetic end of things,
and we're looking at skin color is
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intensity of the pigment is based on
the amount of melanin, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light colored skin is due to the
connective tissue in hemoglobin giving it
[SPEAKER_00]: its light color.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we saw before, geographic location has
a set amount of UV radiation, which
[SPEAKER_00]: correlates with the indigenous skin
pigment, and is the average skin pigment
[SPEAKER_00]: for that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I did say skin color is genetic,
which is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that evident here, where we have a
homozygous, basically recessive,
[SPEAKER_00]: for all of the color genes here,
light, and then all homozygous down here
[SPEAKER_00]: for very dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got our heterozygotes here,
and we breed those here for F2 generation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we get this kind of effect here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most out of resulting from this cross will
be kind of that medium, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: a scale of three, skin color, as it would
be as rare as number six here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see it kind of also depicted
here in a planet square like for a
[SPEAKER_00]: trihybrid cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of have the ideas here,
but with the geographic location being an
[SPEAKER_00]: influence on selecting for one skin type
or one pigmentation versus another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little comparison between what we
see, the macroscopic view and the
[SPEAKER_00]: microscopic view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the photos show 40x magnification,
and Caucasian skin here is A, and may not
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to see it here, but B is located
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a microscopic version of the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see C here for East Indians,
and then D is located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: E is located here for African Americans,
and then F here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking where these letters
are located, the B, the D, and the F might
[SPEAKER_00]: be a little hard to pick out initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you note the progression increase of
melanin as skin pigment darkens,
[SPEAKER_00]: as is, you can check the links here,
courtesy of someone who was able to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide these pictures online,
and I'm using here to show you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're noticing is the melanin or
pigmentation is darkening as our skin
[SPEAKER_00]: color is darkening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what provides us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the melanocyte location.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's producing the actual
melanin, so melanin production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice we're kind of towards the upper
surface here, the epidermis and dermal
[SPEAKER_00]: layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we zoom in that box, it looks like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our specific zoom in of the
melanocyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: To kind of tie it all together,
here's our melanocyte down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be dark skin on the left and
light skin on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we notice that there's a lot of these
melanosomes that are dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So melanin is the pigmentation,
and these cells contain a lot of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that tends to be the darker skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, the lighter skin, we see a lot of
those basically left white or blank.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have that pigmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will show up ultimately as
lighter skin, allowing hemoglobin and
[SPEAKER_00]: connective tissue to show through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here with our intense melanin,
we're getting that darker skin appearance
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, this is our high epidermis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the skin cells that will be kind
of leaving off and getting broken off and
[SPEAKER_00]: being shed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our layer down here that's
working its progression up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this provides a little bit of a
background on the pigmentation of
[SPEAKER_00]: different skin color.
