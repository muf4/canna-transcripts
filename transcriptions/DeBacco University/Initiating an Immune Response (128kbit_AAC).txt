[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at
initiating an immune response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we do have our innate immunity
and our adaptive immunity, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: focus a little bit more on the adaptive
immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind our innate immunity is what
we're born with and includes surface
[SPEAKER_00]: defenses, physical barriers such as our
skin and nucleus membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look a little bit more
about the activation of T and B cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first part is the body needs to be
able to identify cells as friend or as
[SPEAKER_00]: foe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does that with self MHC markers located
on the cell surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, these markers indicate self
and indicate to the immune system that
[SPEAKER_00]: these cells were naturally made and are
part of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in this case, we notice this is
of non-self or a foe marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: These antigens are different or foreign.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't match the host cell markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, this would initiate an immune
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Macrophages are the ones responsible for
inspecting the surface of cells looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for self MHC proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cell displays the MHC protein antigen,
self non-self combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: The macrophage will secrete the protein
interleukin 1 and send an alarm signal to
[SPEAKER_00]: initiate other cells for this immune
response to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now of our foreign body and our macrophage
recognizes that as a foreign body,
[SPEAKER_00]: the CD4 protein is required to
authenticate this transaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interleukin 1 stimulates helper T
cells to initiate two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one end, it's initiating a cellular
response resulting, which is responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: by the T cells and the humoral response,
which is responsible by the B cells that
[SPEAKER_00]: we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the T cells and the cellular response,
once activated, the helper T cells secrete
[SPEAKER_00]: interleukin 2, which activates cytotoxic T
cells to recognize and destroy cells with
[SPEAKER_00]: the specific antigen found in the antigen
presenting cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind this interaction,
the cell-to-cell communication and binding
[SPEAKER_00]: is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our MHC2, here's our antigen,
and here's our T cell receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is activating the helper T cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is then initiating the cytokines to
be released, and this activated cytotoxic
[SPEAKER_00]: T cell is going through and lysing this
infected cell here through this binding
[SPEAKER_00]: that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this method that it chooses to use is
very similar to those of natural killer
[SPEAKER_00]: cells, and this stimulates the
proliferation and activation of these
[SPEAKER_00]: cytotoxic T cells to help initiate this
cellular response to help control these
[SPEAKER_00]: infected cells that might be circulating
throughout the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are T cells and the cellular response?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cytotoxic T cells will also attack
transplant tissue and cause graft
[SPEAKER_00]: rejection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when someone gets an organ transplant,
it's the cytotoxic T cells that may cause
[SPEAKER_00]: that organ to be rejected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drug cyclososporine inactivates
cytotoxic T cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be given after a transplant to
help reduce the chance of someone's body
[SPEAKER_00]: rejecting the organ that they just
received.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now B cells are responsible for the
humoral response.
[SPEAKER_00]: They add antigens here and antibodies is
the key part where they produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So B cells recognize and dating microbes,
but do not go on the attack themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: B cells are responsible for producing
antibodies that inactivate and mark
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens for destruction by non-specific
immune defenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see B cell producing a lot of
antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: These antibodies will be very specific
ends here to bind to very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: antigens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the B cells in the humoral response,
a little bit more complicated here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we do see our B cells becoming
activated and then producing antibodies
[SPEAKER_00]: marking this for destruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now B cells can bind free and unprocessed
antigens.
[SPEAKER_00]: These antigens are endocytes processed and
presented on the surface with MHC
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind there's MHC markers there,
antigen MHC complex, is indicating,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, this is an antigen that we need to be
able to recognize and be able to destroy
[SPEAKER_00]: because we've now marked this as a foreign
invader.
[SPEAKER_00]: The helper T cells recognizes complex and
they will stimulate B cells to proliferate
[SPEAKER_00]: into memory cells and plasma cells,
which are the plasma cells which are
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for the production of the
antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's our memory B cell for long-term
memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, just a couple last notes here
about the antibody action.
[SPEAKER_00]: All antibodies form an antigen antibody
immune complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every antibody has a very specific binding
site that matches a specific antigen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please keep in mind that antibodies
themselves do not destroy the antigen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Antibodies inactivate and tag it for
destruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their sole purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this tagging and labeling component.
[SPEAKER_00]: The antibodies themselves are not doing
the destruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are merely being able to inactivate
it and tag it for destruction so that
[SPEAKER_00]: other cells can come about and do the work
of actual destruction of the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not specifically the antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Antibodies are very important for the
binding and identification, but not for
[SPEAKER_00]: the step of actually lysing or destroying
the cell.
