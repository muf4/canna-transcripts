[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to discuss carbon
dioxide enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, it's important to remember
that carbon dioxide is in the air
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally, but we can see there's a lot of
nitrogen as the highest percentage in the
[SPEAKER_00]: air that we're even breathing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon dioxide is in the air, but at low
levels, so enriching that is particular,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can help plants grow because of the
increased amount of carbon, which they
[SPEAKER_00]: need to produce these sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, let's just start with the
basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what is CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, CO2 is short for carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon dioxide is heavier than air,
so it will sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a non-flammable gas that occurs
naturally in the atmosphere at levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: about 405 parts per million ppm.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when the levels go below 200
parts per million, growth can stunt in
[SPEAKER_00]: plants as a result of the reduction in the
photosynthetic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why trying to maintain 405 parts
per million or even greater can affect
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth, but especially with growth
can stunt if those levels go too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the importance of CO2 in a plant,
well, carbon and carbon dioxide is
[SPEAKER_00]: converted into sugar or glucose molecules
that the plant produces.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carbon inorganic matter originates as
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that carbon dioxide is coming in the
atmosphere plus water and light producing
[SPEAKER_00]: sugars and oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, those sugars can be stored in the
leaves, and where did that come from that
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately can compost down to form
organic matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that carbon source originally was
carbon dioxide from the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants are so good at assembling that
into a more stable compound here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sugar, it can be used for a whole host
of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon dioxide enrichment or carbon
dioxide provides carbon for the plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass and sugar production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that C6H12O6 at glucose is also
important for building components of the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to those sugars, it can be
used for other purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lack of carbon dioxide, so if we
reduce carbon dioxide, can often be a
[SPEAKER_00]: limiting factor in this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So enriching a greenhouse or a grow
facility with carbon dioxide has been
[SPEAKER_00]: around for many years because that is
directly can impact plant growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: assuming water and light are all at
sufficient levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So photosynthetic rate, that's what the PS
is short for, and light in different
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adding extra carbon dioxide will be the
most beneficial for plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: receiving high light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the example here of low light
levels, we could see higher low levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide really don't make any
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, once you get by the low light
levels and increase that light intensity,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could see the low level of carbon
dioxide levels off at a much lower rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher level of carbon dioxide here will
increase the photosynthetic rate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, at those low light intensities
can be a limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, if you're adding CO2,
there's gonna be really no benefit to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the same thing here, where we have
insufficient CO2, excessive CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in a lower light and a higher light,
and we see the same pattern here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher light levels with higher CO2 levels
can result in an increased rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis, assuming water and
nutrients are all above optimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CO2 enrichment can impact yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding or enriching an environment with
CO2 to about 0.12% or 1,200 parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million can increase plant growth by 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note research often debates the ideal CO2
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many will consider this to be too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, levels we're talking about,
700 to 1,200, is kind of where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing that increase in potential for
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what is agreed upon is levels
above 1,500, to be about here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: graph, are not economically viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 700 to 1,000 is a general range
recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are running as high as 1,200,
depending on what controller unit they're
[SPEAKER_00]: using to ensure they're always within that
seven to 1,000 part per million level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But above 1,500, as we can see here,
we're kind of having that reduced growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's simply you're wasting money on
carbon dioxide that's not beneficial to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, dangerous levels of CO2, this is
replying particularly to humans,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is carbon dioxide toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, those levels have to approach
5,000 parts per million, and above are not
[SPEAKER_00]: advised for people to be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may result in lightheadedness,
or worse, due to lack of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some of the symptoms here as
that increases in CO2 level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as what we're trying to keep
our plants at, 0.12% would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that it takes even 1% here
to start having any carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicity for humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's well below anything that would be
of any concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you start getting higher levels,
that's where we start getting those
[SPEAKER_00]: caution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ideal temperature with CO2,
so when enriching with carbon dioxide,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ideal temperature can increase from 85
degrees Fahrenheit to about 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: And above 90, then we'll start to see our
decrease in the photosynthetic rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that increased carbon dioxide allows us
to run our plants a little bit warmer,
[SPEAKER_00]: take advantage of the potential heat that
we may be trying to exhaust anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: and increase in plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The importance of ventilation in a grow
space, so keep in mind ventilation is
[SPEAKER_00]: still important.
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 depletion, especially in greenhouses
or grow tent environments, can be quite
[SPEAKER_00]: common because of the confined space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air should be sealed to help better
regulate CO2 levels, so you're not wasting
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 out some vents or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's important to keep in mind that
ventilation is important, and which
[SPEAKER_00]: creates a delicate balance between venting
out hot air, in this case in particular,
[SPEAKER_00]: and exhausting out the precious CO2 that
you've added.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I've chosen to add the CO2 about
midway through the grow tent, and my
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust port here is at the very top of
the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now CO2 can increase plant metabolism,
which is great because that can cause more
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid growth, increase nutrient
consumption, fill in the space quicker,
[SPEAKER_00]: and greater water usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that when you are
increasing with CO2, and here's my tubing
[SPEAKER_00]: right here, it can also cause that rapid
growth, which is great, but that can cause
[SPEAKER_00]: increased nutrient consumption,
so we want to make sure we're feeding them
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriately, filling the space quicker,
so that could adjust your time if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: new to adding CO2, and greater water usage
because plants are simply growing faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, when you change one
thing, you want to be mindful of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential conditions you could be changing
to keep your plants happy and efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: through the entire life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
