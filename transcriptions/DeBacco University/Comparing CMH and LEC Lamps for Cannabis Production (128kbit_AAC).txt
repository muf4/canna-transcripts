[SPEAKER_00]: One of the advantages of using CMH or LEC
lights is that the available lamp options
[SPEAKER_00]: or bulb options that growers have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this Tobacco University video,
we provide you with some comparisons of
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the options that are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into some of the options you
have for lamps when you're looking at CMH
[SPEAKER_00]: or LEC lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I want you to understand
that yes, many options do exist,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not just buy one light and that's
what you're stuck with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers choice are provided as a
representative sample here, but I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsored nor is there any connection with
the company as part of this comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were selected for this comparison
simply due the options they provide and
[SPEAKER_00]: lamps are a consistent cost with an MSRP
is of this video at $139 each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full spectrum sheets for each bulb is
provided for each as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The summary of options in the 315 watt are
a 3100 Kelvin full phase, 3000 Kelvin R,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is red enhanced, 4200 K,
which is a daylight and a 10,000 finishing
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see them all quickly compared here
provided with a little bit more detail on
[SPEAKER_00]: each.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off that 3000 compared to the 3K
R, which is the 3000 Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's again, it's referring to the
color temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 3K overall is a good spectrum,
similar to high pressure sodiums in that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can grow a plant full term under it,
but it is a little bit better suited for
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering, much like a high pressure
sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the 3000 Kelvin right here,
item number provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the 3K R, a slight increase in the UV
light in comparison to promote resin
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 3K R has a taller peak in the far red
spectrum as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, slightly different or slight
shift there on both the UV light and also
[SPEAKER_00]: the far red spectrum as well, which might
be advantageous for some growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we look here specifically at some
of the information provided by the
[SPEAKER_00]: company, this is the 3K light,
gives you all the information here,
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum, and some of the details here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can pause the video and take a look
at that and compare these different light
[SPEAKER_00]: or lamp sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's that R, you can see that shift
in the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of things stayed the same,
but what does change might again be
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous if you're looking at more of
that UV light and far red end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the 4K light, again,
this is the 4000 Kelvin, similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: natural sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to do a little comparison here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company says it's a metal halide
replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good if you're going to be moving plants
outside after propagation in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be already exposing them to similar
wavelengths that they'll be getting
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, hopefully reducing your hardening
off time and your chance of leaf burn as
[SPEAKER_00]: they transition to the outside natural sun
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's that 4K option there,
and again, that's 4000 Kelvin,
[SPEAKER_00]: different little spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you can see the similar
information here and you can compare this
[SPEAKER_00]: to the ones previously shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the 10K finishing light, this is kind
of an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal here is for increased resin
production as it increases the plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: natural defense response to the increased
amount of exposure it has to the UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suggested to use only for the last seven
to 14 days of the flowering cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: this light can be used for about 25 plus
flowering cycles before it needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: replaced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's intended for growers looking to
maximize the quality of their cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: delivered end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's a major shift towards that
UV spectrum, stressing the plant out,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully stressing it in a good way to
increase some of the finishing and resin
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds that a cannabis plant would
naturally want to produce in response to
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's that same kind of data sheet
that you can go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pause, look at a comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's just an example of using the
same ballast, the same fixture,
[SPEAKER_00]: having these different lamp or bulb
options can really allow a grower to dial
[SPEAKER_00]: in their growing area, can allow for very
easy kind of transition without having to
[SPEAKER_00]: mess with all the ballasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pop a bulb out, put another one in,
and hopefully this helps provide you with
[SPEAKER_00]: some information on some of the options
that exist that you may want to take
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of to maximize your production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
