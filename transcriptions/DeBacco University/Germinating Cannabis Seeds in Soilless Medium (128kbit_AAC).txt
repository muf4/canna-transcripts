[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this tobacco university video
looking at germinating cannabis seeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: soilless medium and kind of giving you
some tips and advantages on why you would
[SPEAKER_00]: go about propagating your cannabis seeds
in this medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get started with the
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, it's important to keep in
mind of the basics for germination,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what substrate media you're
using, certified seed source, these
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, moisture, air conditions,
how deep to plant your seedlings and the
[SPEAKER_00]: light to provide them at that early
development stage are all those
[SPEAKER_00]: germination basics you need to keep in
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would you use soilless media?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the advantage to using soilless
media?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it can be purchased in large
quantities, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy to acquire typically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do get it, it is disease and
weed free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes for a great starting material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has good water holding and
draining characteristics, which is very
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous to growers to allow those
seedlings to establish themselves quite
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used in a variety of containers,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not limiting to any one particular
container type a grower might be using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growers can purchase specific blends
to best match their needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see here, this one on this side
says high porosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to allow it to drain and
breathe very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, maybe a little bit better for a
larger seed or to be used after the
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling stage there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: ProMix is just one example of the many
that are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The specifics when looking at soilless
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, regardless of the manufacturer,
a plug or germination mix should be used
[SPEAKER_00]: and not a pot or grow mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reason being is those plug or germination
mix will be made from a finer material to
[SPEAKER_00]: help ensure good seed to soilless media
contact while still providing air.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two big air pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: In there, that seed could dry out or be at
reduced moisture level, and that could
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce your germination percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see just some comparisons
here of a finer material down this way and
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit coarser material here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you could use that plug or
germination mix just for, it says,
[SPEAKER_00]: the germination process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then transition these seedlings to
that grow mix or that pot or container mix
[SPEAKER_00]: when they get a little bit older and don't
need that fine material to allow for the
[SPEAKER_00]: germination process anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as the plant grows, keep in mind that
plants can be up-potted in a grow or
[SPEAKER_00]: potting mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be used for this point forward in
the grow cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you only want to use that germination
mix really just to get them germinated
[SPEAKER_00]: typically in those small trays that packs
in really well to the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can continue to use the grow
or pot mix for the duration once they have
[SPEAKER_00]: roots for the duration of the grow cycle
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's your bulk media should be that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your germination mix should only be
used during the germination process.
[SPEAKER_00]: To again, help increase the odds of your
success with your cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
