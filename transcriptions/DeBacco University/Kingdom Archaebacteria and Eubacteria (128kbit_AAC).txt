[SPEAKER_00]: So in this video we're going to look
specifically at the kingdom of
[SPEAKER_00]: archaebacteria and eubacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's distinct differences between
the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times these get confused or kind
of merge together and they're different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first the kingdom of archaebacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: They inhibit some of the most extreme
environments on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are autotrophic, meaning they're
producing food by chemosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some archaebacteria genes possess introns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are kind of make them kind of
unique individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extreme environments is the hot
springs here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of what they look like if you
look under the microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kingdom of archaebacteria,
they share certain key characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cell walls lacking peptidoglycan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you remember back when we did gram
standing of bacteria, we looked at the
[SPEAKER_00]: peptidoglycan presence or absence of and
where that might be located.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lack those entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually lipids and unique rRNA sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember rRNA is referring to ribosomal
RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unique rRNA sequences indicate that
there can be classified by this as
[SPEAKER_00]: different and unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how we can start to divide
things into different kingdoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look for certain markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case unusual lipid constructions,
which is our fats, unique ribosomal RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences can help us determine that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of gives you an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the membrane structures that these
archaebacteria may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the numbers are labeled here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to get into that much
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does show some different lipid
sequences between bacteria and our
[SPEAKER_00]: archaea, just so you can have that sense
of comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here a very simple chain format.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here a lot more branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it says unique lipids,
this is what it's referring to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these archaebacteria are groups
into three general categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are kind of based on the
conditions that they may be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these methanogens obtain energy by
using hydrogen gas to reduce carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide to methane gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the kind of the word
methane in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what they're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: These extremophiles are grown under
extreme conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thermophiles means extreme heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heliophiles is extreme salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a wide degree of pH tolerance or
pressure tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the example here of deep ocean vents
is an extremely stressful environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also non-extreme
archaebacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these grow in the same environment as
bacteria do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to be anaerobic environments,
such as those that lack oxygen gas,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very important for the
respiration process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at our comparison chart between
the two, our archaebacteria and our
[SPEAKER_00]: eubacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Archaebacteria didn't be very simple in
living in these extreme conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And introns are present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's those three main types I
talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving over now to eubacteria,
they can be a little more complex,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little more common than our
archaebacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Introns are absent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're spliced out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two main types, our gram positives
and our gram negatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll recognize these as being gram
positive because of their purple color.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were gram negatives, they'd be a
pinkish red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at eubacteria, again, classifying
these, their bacteria are the most
[SPEAKER_00]: abundant organisms on Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They play critical roles throughout the
biosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most taxonomists recognize 12 to 15 major
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bacteria are different from
archaebacteria as they are from
[SPEAKER_00]: eukaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are their own unique
classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the eubacteria being just the
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're simple structure, prokaryotic in
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're different shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we can use to help identify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see not all taxonomists agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 to 15 major groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why there's some variance there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the kingdom of eubacteria, they
reproduce by binary fission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kind of see that going on here in
this image.
[SPEAKER_00]: This includes disease-causing bacteria
such as tooth decay or food poisoning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And archaebacteria and eubacteria contain
all of the prokaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both reproduce by this binary fission,
this division that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they do have some ways to recombine
genes aligned for evolution to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember back to our plasmids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those DNA sequences can be transferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also notice the petri dishes here of
staphylococcus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an example of the eubacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gram-negative bacteria have this
flagellum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This flagellum or pleurofagella is a long
slender projection from the body cell that
[SPEAKER_00]: rotates like a propeller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this allows the bacteria to swim.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you think of it kind of going along and
swimming right along.
[SPEAKER_00]: E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli and salmonella are two examples of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this clarifies the difference
between our eubacteria and our
[SPEAKER_00]: archaebacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're able to tell the difference
between those two and identify certain
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics with each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
