[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been looking for seeds,
this might be a term you've heard before
[SPEAKER_00]: called feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be wondering, well, what is
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, feminized seed's referring to
cannabis seed in particular because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: producing male and female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feminized seed's referring to the
production of seeds that will only produce
[SPEAKER_00]: female plants, which is advantageous for
those are the ones that are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce the buds and the cannabinoids that
we are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the advantage is that producing only
female offspring instead of the 50-50 odds
[SPEAKER_00]: of male to female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of kind of having half the
seeds be male and half the seeds be
[SPEAKER_00]: female, the feminized seed advantage is
sliding the odds in much favor of
[SPEAKER_00]: producing only female offsprings.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is advantageous because it eliminates
the need to produce and care for plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that may not yield any buds or product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The male plants will just produce pollen,
which really isn't of any value unless
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at trying to produce
the female plants that are the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: are producing the buds and the highest
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the production of this, a known female
plant is made to produce male pollen sacs
[SPEAKER_00]: through applying the silver thiosulfate
STS as its abbreviation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pollen can be used to fertilize other
female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look over here, keeping in mind
that females have two X chromosomes and
[SPEAKER_00]: males have an X and a Y chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because we're inducing male pollen sacs
from a female plant, this pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: originally came from a female,
so the chromosomes will be XX resulting in
[SPEAKER_00]: near 100% female seeds produced instead of
the regular 50-50 male to female odds
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the feminized seed advantage is by
ensuring female plants from seed allows
[SPEAKER_00]: the lack of lost time growing a plant that
will not produce a valuable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that valuable product would be
the buds instead of the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're a breeder, you're looking
for pollen, not the best option for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for most people, feminized seed is an
advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantage is that there's
increased cost in most cases for the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and the production of feminized seeds
limits the genetic pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this creates an easy plant and grow
situation, but does not allow for
[SPEAKER_00]: refinement or selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of locked into that set of
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some fields unnatural plant state changes
the chemical profiles by inducing that
[SPEAKER_00]: female production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we have some research going on at
UConn with Jessica Lubell, is a UConn
[SPEAKER_00]: plant science professor looking at
refining the feminized seed production
[SPEAKER_00]: technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently published article, which I'll
link right down here for you, entitled
[SPEAKER_00]: favoring female flowers in hemp
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something to check out in refining this
technique of the production of feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
