[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for attending another DeBacco
University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, we'll be looking at
cannabis compounds, kind of the general
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction to the three main
classifications of compounds that cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: can produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first major category here would be
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The word cannabinoid refers to every
chemical substance, regardless of
[SPEAKER_00]: structure or origin, that joins with
cannabinoid receptors in the body and the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while this is thought of to be cannabis
exclusively, it's actually not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two cannabinoids that are produced in high
amounts, though, in cannabis, would be THC
[SPEAKER_00]: and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are chemical compounds secreted
by the cannabis flowers that provide
[SPEAKER_00]: relief to array of symptoms, including
pain, nausea, anxiety, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC has that strong psychoactive effect,
meaning it makes a person high,
[SPEAKER_00]: that euphoric high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see the chemical structure located
up in this direction over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the CBD down a little bit lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower over on this side is thought to have
anti-psychoactive effect that controls or
[SPEAKER_00]: moderates the psychoactive high caused by
THC and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also been shown to have some
potential medical benefits when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at reducing seizures, just as one
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can notice their chemical structures
are very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be mindful that small changes in
chemical structure can have profound
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing most notably the
difference between THC and CBD located
[SPEAKER_00]: right here with the bonds located in this
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also have something called
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So terpenes are aromatic oils that color
cannabis varieties with distinctive
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors like citrus, berry, mint,
pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants produce terpenes naturally to repel
predators and also attract pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, not unique to cannabis,
but definitely noticed as you hear a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people talk about terpene profiles
regarding a cannabis flower or end
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's terpene profile can be
influenced though by many factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be climate, weather,
the age of the plant, the maturation,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fertilizers, the soil type,
the time of day, and also the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those can all impact the terpene
profile that a plant may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we have flavonoids here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are a class of plant secondary
metabolites that have a polyphenic
[SPEAKER_00]: structure widely found in fruits,
vegetables, and certain beverages as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavonoids are responsible for the color
and aroma of flowers and in fruits attract
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinators and sequentially fruit
dispersion to help in seed and support
[SPEAKER_00]: germination and the growth and development
of seedlings as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavonoids protect the plant from
different biotic and antibiotic stresses
[SPEAKER_00]: and act as unique UV filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be associating that with maybe a
blueberry as it ripens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's different flavonoids
here as they go through the maturation
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants, for example, poison ivy will
produce kind of a reddish tone to their
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are flavonoids to help protect
these young leaves from the harsh UV
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll slowly green up over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a quick overview here of the three
main classifications of compounds produced
[SPEAKER_00]: by the cannabis plant.
