[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at this nice planting here on a
large scale of cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to consider how we're going to
manage weeds in between the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what this video here on DeBaco
University will present four methods with
[SPEAKER_00]: their advantages and disadvantages to even
idea what might be a best fit for your
[SPEAKER_00]: operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go through and look at
between row weed management in a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off we have the cultivation or
sterile seedbed technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages is that this physically
cuts the weeds and this can reduce weed
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers over the course of a season and it
can be applied on a small scale as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: a large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantages is that this can be
challenging and rocky soil because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to disturb that top layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be done on a regular intervals
to really be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can often be offset by weather
events, particularly rain, to reduce its
[SPEAKER_00]: effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the advantages of herbicides is that
they're a very time efficient method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go through, spray and kind of walk away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantages is that there's chemical
restrictions for cannabis production so
[SPEAKER_00]: that can limit potential use of
herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also the possibility of spray
drift that could damage plants that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to have damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to mowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages is that it helps establish
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're planting a cover crop so we can
mow that down here with a brush hog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantages is you need to make sure
that the species are a good match and not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily just weeds but intended for
potential benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at in between rows,
we plant a nice, established, nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: good grass species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we can mow it and that might be a
really good option.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't just want to just mow quote weeds
that we didn't intend on planting because
[SPEAKER_00]: that could potentially still build up high
weeds in our fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, we have a physical
barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the advantages of a physical barrier is
it's very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also reduces soil splash and it creates
clean walking paths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can be great for harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be great to keep plants clean from
the bottom to the top there to eliminate
[SPEAKER_00]: any potential soil splash which can also
potentially reduce disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantages is that there's an
initial cost with this setup and the setup
[SPEAKER_00]: time in ensuring that the physical barrier
that you're laying down doesn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: windblown.
[SPEAKER_00]: That only will reduce its effectiveness
but could also potentially damage the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that you're intending on.
[SPEAKER_00]: On protecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: On protecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
