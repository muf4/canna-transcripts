[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at primary
and secondary immune responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this graph here on the title slide
produces a good summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our concentration of antibodies
here on the y-axis and time on the x-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our initial exposure and we see
our response, immune response,
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually quite low.
[SPEAKER_00]: The primary immune response is a low
affinity of antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a recognition over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have an increase in the
concentration of antibodies and ideally it
[SPEAKER_00]: clears up the primary immune response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the problem goes away and our
antibodies reduce in concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we notice here at the lowest
point, it is not near the low rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: initial exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do notice here at this particular
point, we have a secondary exposure to
[SPEAKER_00]: this same initial threat to the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the immune system becomes activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it becomes activated in a much
shorter period of time and an increased
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because we have a high affinity of
antibodies able to bind very efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after the disease has gone by and
we're taking care of, we see the decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we notice that our secondary response
is much greater and it takes a lot less
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at this a little bit more
specifically, and it looks a little
[SPEAKER_00]: confusing here with all the different
colors, the primary response is the first
[SPEAKER_00]: encounter with a foreign antigen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only a few B cells and T cells
that can recognize this antigen.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, binding of an antigen to its
receptor on the lymphocytes stimulates
[SPEAKER_00]: cell division.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clones produce, and this is called
clonal selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking here at this slightly
different graph, our relative level of
[SPEAKER_00]: antibodies in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have our days of infection
here on the x-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see some of these are antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: IgA sounds familiar, IgG sounds familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have natural killer cells,
neutrophils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not relative level of
antibodies that we saw on the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just relative level of immune
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see our innate immune system
occurs in the early stages and then our
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptive that takes over later that gives
us more of that long range control and
[SPEAKER_00]: memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: IgA we see has a long delay and then comes
up and our CD4T cells occur over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: IgG is very quick early on and then tapers
off in plateaus here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at a very simple graph here,
antibody concentration, our first vaccine,
[SPEAKER_00]: our infection, we have our increase,
it decreases to a point, but keep in mind
[SPEAKER_00]: where that x is, where our secondary point
of infection occurs, it's not anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: near as low as the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see a decrease in duration and an
increase in our antibody concentration the
[SPEAKER_00]: second time around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, how this looks specific to
IgM and IgG.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the antibody lecture,
you'll see a reference to these and it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: provide a little bit more detail on each
of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, compared to the primary response,
the secondary antibody response occurs
[SPEAKER_00]: more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces antibody levels that are
higher and more sustained.
[SPEAKER_00]: The secondary response mostly involves
IgG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll notice our primary and our
secondary both have IgM involved,
[SPEAKER_00]: both have IgG involved, but by far the
secondary response mostly involves the
[SPEAKER_00]: IgG.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that rapid increase and that much
higher level antibody concentration of IgG
[SPEAKER_00]: the second time around than that first
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still notice in both cases IgG and IgM
is first to initiate, but IgG in the
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary response is a very important
component.
[SPEAKER_00]: Types of acquired immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our acquired immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two main forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have active, where organisms has their
own kind of educated cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have passive, where organisms acquire
only the antibodies from another source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are naturally acquired and artificially
acquired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the active where cells get educated
here could be a vaccine, dead or in
[SPEAKER_00]: attenuated pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also have our passive,
which is an injection of immune serum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is two different types we can get
artificially acquired immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Naturally acquired immunity through the
active process is infection contact with
[SPEAKER_00]: the pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we actually get sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: A passive version of naturally acquired
are antibodies passed from mother to fetus
[SPEAKER_00]: via the placenta or infant in her milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a passive way of occurring those
antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly for cows, it's very
important, very soon after birth,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're fed the mother's milk because
that can help get antibodies to cross over
[SPEAKER_00]: the barrier so that they become part of
the individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you miss that only about one two-hour
window of colostrum is the actual mother's
[SPEAKER_00]: milk on the early stages, the antibodies
will not be able to pass the barrier and
[SPEAKER_00]: that individual can easily become sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to go through the active process,
which can be very dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So passive is that simple passing of the
antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, our summary of how the immune
response works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our innate immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, this could be physical barriers
and our adaptive immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have both artificial, which can be
antibody transfer and immunization,
[SPEAKER_00]: or natural, which is passive through the
maternal mother's milk example or through
[SPEAKER_00]: the placenta and active through actually
getting sick through the point of
[SPEAKER_00]: infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that clears up and gives you
a little bit more detail of both primary
[SPEAKER_00]: and our second area immune responses.
Thank you.
