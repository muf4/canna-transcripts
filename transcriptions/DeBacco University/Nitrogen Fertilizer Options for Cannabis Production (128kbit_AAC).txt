[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen is a very important fertilizer
for cannabis plants, but can be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Tobacco University, hope to,
through this video, clarify some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: confusion and get you to understand about
some of the options that exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at nitrogen
fertilizer options for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the effects of nitrogen
fertilizer rate and timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nitrogen can be found in either organic
or inorganic forms in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic forms of nitrogen are found when
the plant and animal material decomposes
[SPEAKER_00]: and releases proteins and amino acids back
into the soil as part of the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: When organic materials are broken down by
bacteria, they form inorganic nitrogen as
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonia, so the process called
ammonification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inorganic nitrogen includes nitrates,
ammonium, and denitrogen gas as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: European research had indicated,
and hemp cultivars do not need as much
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen compared to wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a nice little comparison there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at wheat research,
you may be able to use that as a
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretical maximum here if you're going
to be growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So research from Canada, hemp response to
nitrogen fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So research in Canada demonstrated that
hemp responded to nitrogen up to about 120
[SPEAKER_00]: kilograms of nitrogen per hectare,
which equates to about 110 pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: When soils were deficient by increasing
speed and biomass yield, and again,
[SPEAKER_00]: research stated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research in Saskatchewan showed that
positive response to fertilizer with
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen rates up to 150 kilograms of
nitrogen per hectare, or 130 pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen per acre being optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that there is a little bit
of kind of walking of those numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of a variability in those
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Quebec, they found 180 pounds to the
acre, or 200 kilograms of nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: showed positive response with no plateau
observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, something to take into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the general summary of all this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen rates of 120 kilograms of
nitrogen per hectare, or 110 pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen per acre, to 200 kilograms of
nitrogen per hectare, or 180 pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen per acre, should be the target
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideal target should be around 150
kilograms per hectare, or 130 pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you a good starting point,
so you're not over-fertilizing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also not starving your plants for
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why is nitrogen so difficult?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, nitrogen is so difficult because it
does a lot of changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes through a lot of kind of
transformations, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all major soil nitrogen transformations
are immediate by various soil
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the fate of any fertilizer or
nitrogen source is subject to the
[SPEAKER_00]: following.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to consider mineralization.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is conversion of organic nitrogen to
inorganic nitrogen by microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mineralization effect here,
we can see that portion right here in this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of diagram trying to demonstrate this
visually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrification is the conversion of
ammonium to nitrogen into nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have that nitrification phase that
can also be occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also have denitrification,
which is the conversion of nitrate into
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it becomes lost to the
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example of denitrification,
bringing in nitrogen gas and being kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: lost out to the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing, we have volatilization of
ammonia, loss of ammonia, nitrogen as a
[SPEAKER_00]: gas as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This volatilization, it does occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaching, which is caused by
over-irrigation, especially in sandy soils
[SPEAKER_00]: causing that water to be leached out
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Immobilization is where we have the
conversion of inorganic nitrogen to
[SPEAKER_00]: organic forms, typically then uptake by
plants and microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Immobilization on certain types of clay
soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could see that there's a lot going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our fertilizer inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our potential leaching the
groundwater, our nitrifications,
[SPEAKER_00]: our mineralization or denitrification.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nitric conversions impact at the root
zone pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants uptake ammonium and other
positively charged cations by releasing
[SPEAKER_00]: one hydrogen ion, H plus, into the medium
solution for each ammonium ion to be
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of this release and uptake
that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now over time, the ammonium nitrogen
uptake increases hydrogen ion
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration, thereby lowering the
growing medium pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind pH is the measure of the
hydrogen ion concentrations, and as your
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen ions increase in number,
your pH becomes lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a pH of two has a really high amount of
hydrogen ions, and a pH of eight has a
[SPEAKER_00]: much lower amount of hydrogen ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The uptake of negatively charged anions,
such as nitrate, is most often
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplished by releasing hydroxide ions,
or OH.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this growing medium solution,
hydroxide and hydrogen ions combine to
[SPEAKER_00]: form water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at these independently,
they look positive negative, while H2O is
[SPEAKER_00]: two hydrogens and one oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be a neutral charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, the reaction of hydroxide and
hydrogen ions decreases hydrogen ion
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration and increases the medium pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just an important consideration
to be making that right near the root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone, your pH can be fluctuating,
which could affect nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So impact on different percent of ammonium
on the root zone pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, rose plants were shown grown in
hydroponically in a nutrient solution
[SPEAKER_00]: containing different percentages of
ammonium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the days after fertilization,
and here's the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: The effects are much more dramatic than
what would occur in a commercial growing
[SPEAKER_00]: medium, as it's somewhat buffered due to
the chemical properties added by
[SPEAKER_00]: limestone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was shown in a purely hydroponic
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see that as the percentage
increase of nitrogen in the form of
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonium, we see a steep drop in pH,
and sometimes it stays down there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sometimes it does bounce back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a certain kind of theoretical
threshold amount that's going to maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: that very acidic environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So organic matter and nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, soil organic matter will mineralize
about 20 to 40 pounds of nitrogen per acre
[SPEAKER_00]: per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: 95% or more of the total nitrogen in
surface soils is present as organic
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under normal growing conditions,
when soils are warm, moist, and well
[SPEAKER_00]: aerated, ammonium plus ammonia converts to
nitrate in about two to three weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: making the nitrate in the most abundant
inorganic form of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing this kind of transition
between mineralization, immobilization,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this kind of circle that goes around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we also have this nitrification
where we're having that conversion here
[SPEAKER_00]: that is also occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, soil organic matter,
great thing to have, but it is a key
[SPEAKER_00]: component within this nitrogen cycle
that's occurring in the soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's two forms of our nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's chemical nitrogen fertilizer
options, and there's also going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: organic forms, which I'll talk about in
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your chemical nitrogen forms,
the advantage of these in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: are quickly available to the plant,
and they contains known and defined
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes applications of these very easy
and precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is they can have short
residual times, requiring repeated
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're wondering what fertilizer would
classify as this category, urea,
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonium nitrate, and calcium nitrate are
examples of chemical nitrogen fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: options that would fall into these
advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as these disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you're considering organic
forms, why would someone consider organic
[SPEAKER_00]: forms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're often a free source of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why a lot of growers consider using
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The material can also have other soil
property benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantage of using organic
fertilizer for nitrogen is it can come
[SPEAKER_00]: with other nutrients that may not be
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're fertilizing or only need
nitrogen, you're adding these nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: that contain other forms, you could reach
above optimum or potentially toxic levels
[SPEAKER_00]: of other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, pure organic nitrogen fertilizer
options would be a blood meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, fish and manure, while they
contain high amounts of nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: they also contain other nutrients as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be mindful if you're adding these for
nitrogen, you're also going to be adding a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of phosphorus and potassium as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the organic versus synthetic
fertilizers, well, here's our organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're feeding the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Synthetics are feeding the plants more of
a direct line to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organics do have a couple intermediate
steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what I want you to realize is no
matter what fertilizer option you choose,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're both ideally being uptake by the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do require maybe a little different
timing, a little bit more expertise by the
[SPEAKER_00]: grower to kind of dial both of these in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the end result, ideally to the
plant, the nitrogen should be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, don't favor one or the other
just because you want to be organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think that's 100% better and better
for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Synthetics may have their place
particularly early on when these soil
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms might be a little slower to
get going in the early part of the season
[SPEAKER_00]: when your plants might be showing nitrogen
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be aware of both options and utilize
both when they best fit your growing situation.
