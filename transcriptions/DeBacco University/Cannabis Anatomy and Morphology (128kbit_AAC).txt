[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at some of the
physical attributes of cannabis with the
[SPEAKER_00]: anatomy and morphology which are basically
referring to what you can physically see
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the terms anatomy and morphology are
basically interchangeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anatomy is the basic structure of an
organism and morphology is the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship of the organism and their
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not going to really spend too
much time on any of the specifics so for
[SPEAKER_00]: our purposes these are basically
interchangeable terms because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the relation of the structures
and the function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Major structures are presented as titles
and the functions are provided in the
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the shoot and root
systems the plant morphology pertains to
[SPEAKER_00]: the vegetative structures and the
reproductive structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two main systems the shoot which
is the upper system here is what we mainly
[SPEAKER_00]: see or associate with the plant and that
can be the nodes the internodes the buds
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves and we have the root system
down here which supports the upper growing
[SPEAKER_00]: portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a lot of roots there's tap
roots and also very important root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with the roots here they're
responsible for absorbing water and
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a bunch of roots here in a
propagator.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also important for anchoring the
plant to allow for upright growth and they
[SPEAKER_00]: store food that is synthesized in the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So roots have a very important function
despite them mostly being below ground and
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes not seen by growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stems are structures that support the
leaves and they allow the leaves to take
[SPEAKER_00]: best advantage of capturing light energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also conduct water and minerals
absorbed by the roots in the leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: they can also store food and water in
their tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see kind of a cut away section here and
the exact stem structure may differ
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on what portion of the plant
you're talking about or how old that
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maristems are the regions of sites of high
cell division.
[SPEAKER_00]: The apical maristem are the shoot
maristems located at the top of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can see an apical maristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you see all of our maristematic
tissues of the shoots up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This most likely would be the apical if
you're growing a plant in one single way.
[SPEAKER_00]: These could be laterals here based on the
different pruning methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind there's also maristems in the
roots and they occur at the very tips of
[SPEAKER_00]: the ever growing roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a quick stem anatomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our nodes which are a site here
where our leaves attach, the petals
[SPEAKER_00]: attach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then our internodes and that's the
distance between those two nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers may talk about keeping short
internodes and that's keeping the area
[SPEAKER_00]: here or the amount of stem between your
leaves where they attach to the stem as
[SPEAKER_00]: short as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be important for a variety of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants that have long internodes tend to
be very wispy and can break easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaf structure are responsible for
capturing light to aid in the production
[SPEAKER_00]: of food or sugars in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here a nice leaf structure in
a pretty dense canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within there or supporting those leaves we
have a vascular tissue that occurs in the
[SPEAKER_00]: stems and also the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They transport water and nutrients to the
plant and they act as a circulatory system
[SPEAKER_00]: for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two main components and they're
located in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're highlighted here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our xylem which is more interior
and that's conducting water and dissolved
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients from the roots and upper
portions of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our phloem which is conducting
cells transporting sugar and other plant
[SPEAKER_00]: products up and down the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So xylem is water only in the upward
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phloem is moving food up and down and
throughout the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly we have flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the reproductive organs that
produce seeds that will become the next
[SPEAKER_00]: generation plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowers of course are the site of seed
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: However in cannabis often the goal is not
to produce seeds but the chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds such as CBDs or in other cases
THCs or flavonoids or terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These flowers here are not producing
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going through the process of cannabis most
growers are not looking to produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more interested in the chemical
compounds that the plant can produce.
Thank you.
