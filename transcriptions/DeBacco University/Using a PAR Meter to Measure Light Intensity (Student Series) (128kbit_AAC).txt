[SPEAKER_01]: On this Tobacco University video I'm going
to go over using a PAR meter to measure
[SPEAKER_01]: light intensity and this is part of our
student series.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to turn it over to students
so you can hear from them the importance
[SPEAKER_01]: of using a PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a PAR meter and we use it to read
the light intensity coming off of our
[SPEAKER_00]: lights and onto the cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't see this as an
important instrument to use in their
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis grow because they simply don't
understand that especially with baby
[SPEAKER_00]: clones that they do not require or need as
much light as the bigger ones do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically with lights like these you
could expect them to be at a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: volts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using a PAR meter you could see
accurately how much the light will
[SPEAKER_00]: actually be penetrating each of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see down here we read at about
330 light intensity which is a little high
[SPEAKER_00]: for little baby plants but regardless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up here we have a reading of over 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now typically you wouldn't want your
reading to be at 300 for clones because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're tiny and they don't need that much
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in our case we're using clones from
outside and outside of course the light
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity is much stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in certain cases like this it wouldn't
necessarily matter that it's higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is good to have a PAR meter so that
you can know just how much light your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are absorbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
