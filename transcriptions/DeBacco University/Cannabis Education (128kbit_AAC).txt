[SPEAKER_00]: So on this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to just go a brief overview here
[SPEAKER_00]: of regarding cannabis education.
[SPEAKER_00]: So education is important in any walk of
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look a little bit more
at the importance of cannabis education.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when looking at cannabis education,
I'd like to say that you're in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of this channel is to provide a
quality education on all the topics
[SPEAKER_00]: covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regarding cannabis, this can be difficult
to come by to get that kind of information
[SPEAKER_00]: that is scientifically based.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by connecting to establish scientific
information, this can help propel the
[SPEAKER_00]: expanse of cannabis education forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here at DeBaco University,
hopefully you've seen some other videos on
[SPEAKER_00]: that, try to connect a lot to the
scientific research while maybe somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: limited to again, drive some more
conversation and to hopefully keep
[SPEAKER_00]: propelling the education forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we want to avoid opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now opinions can be great initially,
but for real basis of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes opinions as well as anecdotal
information can be hard to separate from
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific based information to be sure to
trace a source of the information
[SPEAKER_00]: presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is really to base any sort of
conclusions or information you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at in scientific research.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be difficult to find and it can
also be difficult to initially read.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why part of the goal of this
channel is to kind of break it down and
[SPEAKER_00]: give you kind of the general summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have more interest, you can go into
more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind opinions and anecdotal
information opinions are kind of great at
[SPEAKER_00]: the very first level here, but we want to
work our way up to kind of the more
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced levels we're looking at research
end of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good starting point,
but keep in mind it is only a starting
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how could you go about kind of starting
your own scientific investigation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Google Scholar is a very powerful
search engine and tool to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quickly, it's quick to be able to
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very user friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find articles and topics that are
scientifically based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good kind of area to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just search it, type in whatever you're
interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This applies to cannabis as well as any
other topic as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Google Scholar is a great way to kind of
be able to efficiently search a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific articles quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you find one scientific article
that you like, well, as I say,
[SPEAKER_00]: one good article can lead to many more.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're finding scientific articles,
the goal is to find that one article you
[SPEAKER_00]: like on a topic, well structured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to look at the sources for
potentially other related articles as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at their reference list.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can lead to an expansive list,
but can help provide a well rounded
[SPEAKER_00]: education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when you're reading the scientific
article, there might be a little number or
[SPEAKER_00]: a last name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can then match that up to the
reference list and then go research that
[SPEAKER_00]: original article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way to kind of get more into
the details, whatever topic or subject
[SPEAKER_00]: area you're looking at learning about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the scientific articles I'll provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when scientific articles are presented
here, at least on this channel,
[SPEAKER_00]: DeBaco University, they come with the
proper reference citation, APA style.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can easily find them and you're
welcome to use this as a starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's just one example right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give you a screenshot of like the first
page of the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give you the proper citation as well as
a link.
[SPEAKER_00]: Summaries are provided in the videos
provided here, but you are welcome to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and research that article for
yourself to get more detail if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: interested, particularly in that topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here at DeBaco University,
we're not just a standalone area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: These videos are utilized at the
University of Connecticut, the New York
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanical Gardens, as well as Florida Gulf
Coast University.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least ones that I'm directly aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there are many others.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching this from another
university or another professors link
[SPEAKER_00]: these videos, be sure to comment in the
comments below this video here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it's always great to see
information to be educating students on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis as well as other topics as
biology and forensic science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always great to see where students
are from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to comment, I always go
right ahead, but hopefully this is helping
[SPEAKER_00]: spread the positive word, the good
scientific backed information regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis education.
