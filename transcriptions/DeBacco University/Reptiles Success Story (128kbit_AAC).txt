[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to tell you a little bit
about reptiles' success story and how
[SPEAKER_00]: they've become so well adapted to the
terrestrial or land environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see some sea turtles here,
recently hatched, making a run for the
[SPEAKER_00]: water here, hopefully not yet picked up by
any predators or seagulls on their way
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the history of
reptiles, the origin and evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, they arose from
amphibians.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the earliest fossils is about 359
million years ago, a small four-legged
[SPEAKER_00]: vertebrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's important to make the distinction
between a reptile and amphibian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reptiles are cold-blooded, have a
backbone, scaly skin, and lay eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, amphibians pictured
here are cold-blooded.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a similarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have a backbone, but they have
moist skin, they lay eggs near water,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they go through a metamorphosis during
their life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, we're going to be focused
more on the reptiles here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get them confused with the
amphibians.
[SPEAKER_00]: So success of reptiles, well, there's four
important steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to focus on two in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the watertight skin, the keratin,
which gives them their watertight
[SPEAKER_00]: abilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respiration, they develop lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expiration, they actually use uric acid,
which requires very little water,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they can conserve water, so they're not
wasting a lot of that, and the amniotic
[SPEAKER_00]: egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little quote here, it's not the
strongest of the species that survives,
[SPEAKER_00]: nor the most intelligent, but the one most
adaptable to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind as we look here at
reptiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, amphibians, example frogs,
cannot be considered fully terrestrial
[SPEAKER_00]: because they lose too much water through
their skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amphibians must stay moist to avoid
dehydration, and their method of
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduction requires a moist environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that here with little toads swimming
in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reptiles, though, have evolutionary
adaptations that free them from the water,
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to live much more on land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, they still require water,
but they don't have to be living in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can handle a much harsher and more
arid environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that watertight skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terrestrial animals face serious problems
of water loss as water evaporates through
[SPEAKER_00]: their skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Modern reptiles have evolved a skin made
of light, flexible scales that overlap to
[SPEAKER_00]: form protective, almost watertight skin
that minimizes water loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here, and if you ever touch
the snake, you might expect them to be
[SPEAKER_00]: slimy, but it's actually just this
interlocking kind of scale there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the main goal is to reduce water loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're adding the advantage of
camouflage in both these cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really those interlocking watertight
skin allows them to survive in these much
[SPEAKER_00]: drier regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watertight eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, without a watery environment,
both sperm and eggs will dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A reptile's fertilized eggs need a moist
environment in which to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amniotic egg solves this problem of a
reptile needing a moist environment to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have that harsh outer shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have that nice kind of watery
environment underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the inside allowing for the embryo to
develop inside a dry sand here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in its small micro environment inside
the egg, it has the water that it needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to survive through its early
stages of development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watertight eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: An amniotic egg contains both water supply
and food supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a key to a reptile's success as a
terrestrial animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The egg's tough shell makes it essentially
watertight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not dry out, even in very dry
habitats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most reptiles, all birds, and three
species of mammals actually reproduce by
[SPEAKER_00]: the amniotic eggs with shells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the formation of amniotic eggs
suggests that these three groups of
[SPEAKER_00]: animals evolved from a common ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we say amniotic eggs,
we might think of the ones we buy in the
[SPEAKER_00]: store, but realize that there's many
different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may have been fortunate enough
to see like Robin's eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes their nests are located in areas
near houses or developments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another example of the amniotic
watertight egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they come in all sort of shapes,
colors, ways to camouflage them,
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to stand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each unique based on individual species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the amniotic egg reptiles considered
the first terrestrial vertebrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amniotic egg first evolved in
reptiles, but also found in, as I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: mammals and birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protection from the physical damage is the
hard outer shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This limits the evaporation of water,
but still able to diffuse oxygen and
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here in our progression,
our cladogram, we see development of the
[SPEAKER_00]: amniotic egg being fairly far along in the
development process here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So relatively advanced animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing with this, we have the internal
structure of the amniotic egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ammion, which is the thin membrane that
encloses the fluid where the embryo
[SPEAKER_00]: floats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here by this kind of purpley grayish
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yolk sac, which encloses the yolk fat
rich food supply for the embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the yolk is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the allatelis, allatemis,
which stores water produced by the embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the chorion, which
surrounds all other membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that located here is the chorion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Albumin is the protein in the water for
the embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the albumin located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in part what makes eggs very
nutritious and why a lot of people eat
[SPEAKER_00]: them is because they do contain a lot of
this protein and a lot of these good
[SPEAKER_00]: supplies, assuming they weren't
fertilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the amniotic egg, the amniotic encloses
the embryo with the watery environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: creating like a little pond is a way to
think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That watery region within this hard
protective shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shell also protects the egg from
being crushed depending on what
[SPEAKER_00]: environment it may be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animals may be sitting on this,
it might be buried in sand, or buried in
[SPEAKER_00]: the nest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's offering protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting about the amniotic egg
is the yolk sac contains the yolk,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the developing food supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that young embryo, this sac stores
waste products from the embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the allatelis stores the waste
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because remember, we're in a sealed
environment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just can't have a way to just
produce nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need an area to put the waste
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also 11 gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while this is a hard protective shell,
there's also carbon dioxide able to
[SPEAKER_00]: diffuse out and oxygen is able to diffuse
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is an air space a little bit
there, allowing this embryo to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: basically breathe within a, quote,
sealed environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blood vessels in the walls carry oxygen,
carbon dioxide from the embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, this is a living,
developing individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amniotic egg surrounded by the
element, yolk sac, and allatelis is the
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane called the chorion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chorion allows oxygen to enter the egg
in carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very important portion to
allow that individual to be able to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever seen a bird break through,
it must be able to breathe air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't just kind of get
suffocated in that egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're allowed to exchange that carbon
dioxide and oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That last kind of picture here,
identifying some of the key parts,
[SPEAKER_00]: where certain things are located,
a little different image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be able to kind of identify the main
parts and also what their functions are.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the importance of the amniotic egg,
which led to the success of reptiles being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to make that jump from the watery
environment to the arid, dry land
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
Thank you.
