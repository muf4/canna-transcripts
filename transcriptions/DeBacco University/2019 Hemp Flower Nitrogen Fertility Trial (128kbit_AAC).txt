[SPEAKER_00]: Many growers rightfully ask, how much
nitrogen should I fertilize my hemp plants
[SPEAKER_00]: with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this trial will hopefully answer that
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in Tobacco University,
I'm going to provide you a summary of the
[SPEAKER_00]: 2019 Hemp Flower Nitrogen Fertility Trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you enjoy it and hope it answers a
lot of questions for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, first off, where did I get this
information?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, from UVM.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is up in Vermont Extension Service.
[SPEAKER_00]: They provided a great trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully here you can see the source.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to find out more information
from the Vermont Extension Service,
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of gives you an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were looking at evaluating the
impact of five different nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: application rates on the growth habit,
yield, flower quality, and whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition concentration of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to provide you with a summary
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, how much nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, grows in many crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to fertilize each year with
nitrogen to help ensure plant growth over
[SPEAKER_00]: the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over adding can lead to potential negative
environmental impacts and unnecessary
[SPEAKER_00]: increased cost to the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen can be variable in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a June nitrate test,
which can help provide an idea of what it
[SPEAKER_00]: is in specific fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great for growers to know and to
utilize and take advantage of that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular test.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what is the target for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it respond compared to
traditional nitrogen application rates?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of trial helped answer some
of those questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was the design of the trial?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important with any kind of trial
you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the trial was initiated in a broader
view research farm up in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in the northern part of Vermont.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the experimental design was a
randomized complete block design with four
[SPEAKER_00]: replications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plots consisted of five plants spaced five
feet apart in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plot treatments consisted of five
nitrogen application rates listed in
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds of nitrogen per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Including a control, which was zero
pounds, 75 pounds, 100 pounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: 125 pounds, and 150 pounds of nitrogen per
acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was the fertility rates here that
we can see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the plots within the individual
trials here receive nitrogen fertility and
[SPEAKER_00]: split applications over an eight week
period starting on the 28th of June in the
[SPEAKER_00]: form of ammonium nitrate plus sulfur,
uranium 2800.
[SPEAKER_00]: Applied directly to individual plants as
we can see here in table three,
[SPEAKER_00]: weekly hemp nitrogen fertility rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the application rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the in gallons per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the weekly application rate here in
gallons per acre and in milliliters per
[SPEAKER_00]: plant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the treatments were zero of course,
they're across the board, 75 pounds of the
[SPEAKER_00]: acre, 100 pounds of the acre, 125 pounds
of the acre, and 150 pounds of the acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also gives growers a great way to
convert the stated typically that they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: find pounds of the acre to something might
be a little bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: For their operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what about other nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, based on the soil test results,
no further nutrients were required for
[SPEAKER_00]: production of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of an example here of the
results and everything was pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: within the optimum range or excessive as
we see here with phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was determined that we could really
just look at the nitrogen here and not
[SPEAKER_00]: worry about any of the other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So transplanting and cover cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the four week old hemp seedlings were
transplanted on June 19th into a seedbed
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared with conventional tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: A cover crop mixture of tillage radish and
annual ryegrass was planted between rows
[SPEAKER_00]: on the 26th of June.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives you a little background here
of the conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irrigation was applied a weekly basis at a
rate of 8,000 gallons of water per acre
[SPEAKER_00]: delivered via drip tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: No irrigation duration and amount was
modified based on weekly rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this wasn't just a guaranteed amount
based on the natural rain that occurred,
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustments were made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now pre-harvest, each flower samples were
taken from the top eight inches of colas
[SPEAKER_00]: and sent to be analyzed for cannabinoid
and terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant harvest process on October 21st,
all plants were harvested and broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flower buds were dried at 80 degrees
Fahrenheit or ambient temperature with
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow until dry enough for storage
without the risk of molding.
[SPEAKER_00]: A subsample of the flower bud from each
plot was dried in a small dehydrator and
[SPEAKER_00]: wet weights and dry weights were recorded
in order to calculate the percent moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: of the flower buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The percent moisture at harvest was used
to calculate the dry matter yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: After middle three plants were harvested
and measured and collected, the remaining
[SPEAKER_00]: two plants were harvested on October 28th
and shipped to be analyzed for whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind where those five plants,
so they kind of looked at the middle three
[SPEAKER_00]: and then went back until the end two
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again just kind of understand the
parameters of this particular trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now growing season weather is outdoor
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weather is always important.
[SPEAKER_00]: July was simply hot and dry compared to
the 30-year average.
[SPEAKER_00]: August and September were slightly cooler
than normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: October had warmer above average
temperature and precipitation and shows
[SPEAKER_00]: that they accumulated 2,211 growing degree
days, which is about 197 more than the
[SPEAKER_00]: historical average.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these due to the mid-season heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp plants receive supplemental
irrigation to account for precipitation
[SPEAKER_00]: deficits, although the growing season,
throughout the growing season as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, here's the weather data here
just to give an idea of how it was
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to quote a normal year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant height and the plant weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, plants height did not significantly
differ between nitrogen application rates
[SPEAKER_00]: here shown in table five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole plant weight was highest when grown
in 75 pounds nitrogen to the acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: 125 and 150 pounds the acre rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So see that comparison here looking at
plant height and then the whole weight of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did see some differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the flower bud and yield, which is
what everyone usually goes to when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at hemp flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: At harvest a composite sample of flower
material was collected from each plot and
[SPEAKER_00]: then dried down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was used to determine the flower dry
matter and calculate dry matter flower
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no significant difference among
treatments for dry matter yields or yields
[SPEAKER_00]: at 8% moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole plants receiving or while plants
receiving 150 pounds of nitrogen per acre
[SPEAKER_00]: application rate had the highest wet bud
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dry matter yields overall,
but also had the highest amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: unmarketable flower material at 78 pounds
to the acre compared to the next highest
[SPEAKER_00]: rate of 100 pounds nitrogen to the acre
with only 9.1 pounds to the acre of
[SPEAKER_00]: unmarketable material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to look at the total
material produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also consider the amount that's
unmarketable because that's going to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: into overall profits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unmarketable flower included any flower
that had suffered from disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: rot, soil contamination, or otherwise
damaged flower material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how they were defining that
unmarketable flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for the cannabinoids, note that only
one variety and one source of fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: was tested in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher rates of nitrogen source and other
macronutrients or micronutrients may have
[SPEAKER_00]: some impact on cannabinoid profiles that
was not expressed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, kind of a limited data set here
based on this trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for terpene profiles, we can see them
listed here based on treatment for some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the common terpenes all presented in parts
per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see the kind of the ones in bold here
and we could see a lot of variability
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst all the nitrogen treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no clear winner here as far as
terpene profiles go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're indicating here a little bit that
75 definitely looks like it had a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, not very consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least we don't see a trend here with
150 always produced the highest terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously here was not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the results from that this 2019 trial
is that the 100 pounds of nitrogen per
[SPEAKER_00]: acre rate showed over 1% higher values for
CBD compared to the next highest values.
[SPEAKER_00]: And results suggest that nitrogen rates
may have an impact on CBD concentration,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not THC concentrations for the this T2
cultivar that was studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite minor yet not statistically
significant differences in yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: flour quality differences in the form of
cannabinoids and terpenes were noted with
[SPEAKER_00]: changes in nitrogen rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that the 100 pounds of the acre rate
yield the highest CBD percentage per
[SPEAKER_00]: weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this was not significantly different
than the 125 or 150 rates, this 75 pounds
[SPEAKER_00]: per acre rate had the highest levels of
terpenes, but the lowest CBD percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you have to look at what you're
ultimately going to be looking at for
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest or marketable yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's the general kind of end result
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the general suggestion for cannabis
production?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, looking at this data here,
summarizing it in one kind of quick slide
[SPEAKER_00]: here, growers should be using 100 pounds
per acre of nitrogen as the target when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will offer the best chance at a
quality yield with reduced chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: negative environmental impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just adding more nitrogen is not
necessarily going to get you more yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Targeting that 100 pounds to the acre of
nitrogen would be recommended based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: extensive data and trial information
presented here.
