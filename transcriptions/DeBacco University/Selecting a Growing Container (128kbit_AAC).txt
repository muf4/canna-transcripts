[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are many different types of
containers when growing, and selecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: right one is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you go about looking at the
options that are there, and how do you go
[SPEAKER_00]: about selecting the right one for your
situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's many factors that come into
play.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we see here, looking at many different
colors, you want to consider what else is
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room, what size is the room,
what are the other room colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the same thing comes in when
selecting a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be thinking about what type of
plants we're growing, what size are they
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be, what are we looking at for
convenience, what are the costs,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the availability, what's the size,
the shape, the color, staging plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: the material, and are we growing in large
beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, all these things come into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's simply a little bit more
complex than you may have originally
[SPEAKER_00]: thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: The material is the first thing to
consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the plant may not be directly
affected by the material, the material
[SPEAKER_00]: that the container is made out of can have
many different types and different
[SPEAKER_00]: properties associated with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clay pots are kind of the old,
old standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will wick moisture away, increasing
the need for irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, these are rarely used in
large-scale production anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metal pots can corrode over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wooden pots, sadly with wooden pots,
they can break down over time or degrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also harbor disease and can be
used for multiple cropping cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, the main focus here and most
popular, of course, is plastic pots due to
[SPEAKER_00]: their lightweight ease of storage,
long life, and reduced moisture loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, this will be the main focus
of the discussion from here on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have rigid and grow bags,
both fall under the plastic category.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want you to be aware of some of the
other pots, but plastic, by far,
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be the main focus here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So convenience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers use what they can easily
find.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's on the shelf?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I have some extras of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes this is what's free,
what they can wash and clean, the
[SPEAKER_00]: containers before use.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this leads to issues with
consistency, having different pot sizes
[SPEAKER_00]: and different shape pots, reduce your
efficiency, so overall cost savings is
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give the example, if you have a very small
pot and a very large pot, and you're both
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to grow a plant in those,
they have very different watering
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could miss one, need to overwater one,
and this creates just that lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency, that lack of efficiency in
your grow operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want to be looking at the cost of
the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while the cost will depend on many
factors, typically the thickness and size
[SPEAKER_00]: of the containers are typically the
driving force behind the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can reach use plastic pots after a good
rinse and wash down, so this can vastly
[SPEAKER_00]: impact your long-term container budget if
you're able to reuse those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind also the cost of shipping
when comparing containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will cause, say, free
shipping, some if you order over a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: amount, so you want to keep the shipping
cost as also a factor in the total cost of
[SPEAKER_00]: that container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see there's a lot of little
different puzzle pieces when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: putting together the final cost,
but all these must be considered so you
[SPEAKER_00]: get the true accurate assessment of the
final cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: The availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you get now?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers kind of wait to the last
minute and then want to buy something,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that can run into some issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you should select a container
that is the best fit for your growing
[SPEAKER_00]: operation, not just what you can get now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not change this because the one pot or
the one container that you're looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: is back-ordered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often back-ordered for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's typically a very popular pot,
and you want to plan your grow around
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just want to go, oh, that one's
back-ordered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just go with this one, and I'll have
a run of those size pots, or those type of
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, keeping everything efficient,
keeping everything consistent is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important, and get away from just kind of
ordering late and getting what is
[SPEAKER_00]: available now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you back-order just a little bit,
it's potentially worth the wait to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow operation as efficient as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The size of the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So size does in part relate to the age of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most growers will simplify and use three
main sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small pots at four inches to one gallon
are typically used for clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medium pots are considered about three
gallons, and they're for the early part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you transplant into flowering or
into final stages, five to 10 gallon pots
[SPEAKER_00]: are for the main grow and flowering phase
to maximize yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most growers are using about seven to 10
gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some may even go larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: For mother plants, some people use 10
gallons or sometimes even larger pots for
[SPEAKER_00]: that instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Container shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taller pots are preferred over wider
window garden style containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of want our pots to be taller and
thinner than kind of this long appearance
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows to easily pack in more plants
under our sometimes limited lighting area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Container color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of theories or ideas
behind color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically white will be a little less
likely to absorb heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, standard black pot is by far the
most widely used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers want to try reds or blues
because of increased growth that has been
[SPEAKER_00]: shown in reports with like tomatoes or
squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this data is based on plastic mulch
and outdoor growing situations as we see
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These containers do not really reflect
that much light to the plant canopy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's why color doesn't matter that
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in the outdoor grow situation,
we see the sunlight coming down reflecting
[SPEAKER_00]: this large area of light up at the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking down at the light that may hit the
pot and reflect it up to the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: well it's just basically the rim.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that color is going to have a very
minimal impact on the plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though color can potentially have
an impact on large field grown operations
[SPEAKER_00]: with plastic mulches, container growing
the area is greatly reduced and much
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So color is by far least important here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in large beds,
some growers choose to grow in large beds
[SPEAKER_00]: here, like the big boxes filled with media
where multiple plants may be grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially this may sound easier than many
of these little pots to move around,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this design typically wastes a lot of
soil and you're constantly changing after
[SPEAKER_00]: each growth cycle, and it can be a lot of
a greater challenge here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically raised beds are not advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing plants individually in pots is the
preferred method to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: With plastic pots, that's by far the most
efficient way, so you want to keep that in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind to keep your grow operation as
efficient and easy to maintain as possible.
