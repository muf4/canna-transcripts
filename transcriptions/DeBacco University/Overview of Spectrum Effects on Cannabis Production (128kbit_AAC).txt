[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this tobacco university video
we're looking at the overview of spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: effects on cannabis production So
[SPEAKER_00]: here we're going to take a look at some of
the different spectrums and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: effects they have on plants So first off
should start with a general summary and
[SPEAKER_00]: this provides a quick visual and textual
summary of the major Classifications of
[SPEAKER_00]: the different spectrums in addition to the
main impact on the plant is also provided
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning when we look at UV light that can
slow growth and Enhance oil production in
[SPEAKER_00]: relation to cannabis for blue light that
can reduce cell expansion and cause plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to be shorter Green light does penetrate
leaves and does facilitate human vision in
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnosis of different plant diseases or
potential nutrient deficiencies Red light
[SPEAKER_00]: is very efficient for the photosynthetic
process and far red light can enhance cell
[SPEAKER_00]: expansion and cause plants to stretch So
if you give plants blue and far red to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of have some competing this there one
wants it to keep straight keep stretch one
[SPEAKER_00]: wants it to keep it short and stocky so
again the amount and kind of Proportions
[SPEAKER_00]: of these you give a plant can impact its
morphological outcome So looking at just
[SPEAKER_00]: the general McKee curve Here so the McKee
curve was developed in the late 1960s to
[SPEAKER_00]: early 1970s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an attempt to understand how plants
utilize light Interpret this with caution
[SPEAKER_00]: as the study was done with multiple points
and time data points that was put into a
[SPEAKER_00]: curve of a graph So kind of like a bunch
of little points They kind of made into a
[SPEAKER_00]: graph Plants can adjust to their
environments and plants will make the most
[SPEAKER_00]: of the light available to them Which may
result in changes in their morphology So
[SPEAKER_00]: just again keep that also in mind that
this is just a suggested curve and give
[SPEAKER_00]: you just an idea of how plants May utilize
the light spectrum Looking specifically at
[SPEAKER_00]: some details within this looking at the UV
light So starting at that kind of 100 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 nanometer are the basics of UV light
UV radiation spectrum Is divided into
[SPEAKER_00]: three regions called UVA UVB and UVC as
sunlight passes through the atmosphere all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the UVC and most of the UV UVB is
absorbed by the ozone water vapor oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: in carbon dioxide Meaning plants will be
exposed to it less than if they were say
[SPEAKER_00]: growing Outside of Earth say the
International Space Station UVA is not
[SPEAKER_00]: filtered as significantly by the
atmosphere So it's able to penetrate and
[SPEAKER_00]: reach the surface of Earth to a little bit
higher degree the UV region Covers the
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths range from 100 to 400
nanometers and is divided into those three
[SPEAKER_00]: bands UVA being 315 to 400 nanometers UVB
280 to 315 UVC 100 to 280 nanometers the
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively long wavelength UVA accounts
for approximately 95% of the UV radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: reaching Earth's surface just to put that
in perspective there with increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: altitude and there's less atmosphere is
available to absorb UV radiation so with
[SPEAKER_00]: Every 1,000 meters in altitude UV levels
increase by approximately 10% just showing
[SPEAKER_00]: you the impact elevation or distance from
sea level can have Now UV and plants
[SPEAKER_00]: response so let's relate this now to act
of the plants UV light response in plants
[SPEAKER_00]: is similar to blue light meaning UV does
not drive photosynthesis and can also
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger cannabinoid synthesis and
potentially reduce disease UV light does
[SPEAKER_00]: cause some stress to the plants that they
may develop thicker leaves and or
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially protective compounds as we see
here and the plant pictured with
[SPEAKER_00]: pigmentation such as anthocyanins that
purple coloration some plants would do
[SPEAKER_00]: this naturally But if we're seeing that
that is a response usually to some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: stress in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a light stress from UV light
Here's a new look at some old data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of interesting research
kind of I came across and some
[SPEAKER_00]: interpretation of that research So Dr.
Bugby's lab in Utah State University
[SPEAKER_00]: investigated physics Kenneth McKee's data
from the 1970s and relative photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency Looking at the data the error
bars represent a range of plant species
[SPEAKER_00]: from the paper showing small variations
among species when grown in the field The
[SPEAKER_00]: growth chamber of plants indicated larger
variability and we kind of see that here
[SPEAKER_00]: with the lines Kind of being a little bit
larger here in the growth chamber a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit smaller overall in the field Question
is is it possible that field-grown plants
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones here at the top have synthesized
compounds to block UV for the protection
[SPEAKER_00]: of light reducing the effectiveness of
those wavelengths and we're seeing that
[SPEAKER_00]: here's our line Here's our UV radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing in the field less much
reduced kind of amount of Relative quantum
[SPEAKER_00]: yield and in the growth chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the variability is greater,
but we're seeing an increase in that curve
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it possible because of the high
intensity of lights that the field-grown
[SPEAKER_00]: crops have to deal with are they producing
compounds that are blocking out some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that UV light to help protect them from
potential damaging effects so just Kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: a unique look at some older data Now those
blue photons as I mentioned before blue
[SPEAKER_00]: photons reduce cell expansion So it's
going to tend to keep plants a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter and a little bit stockier Blue
photons as a result keep the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter reduce leaf expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's 5% blue is 20% But we see that
plant is definitely a stockier shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: internodes This morphology difference in
canvas plants grown under 5% blue versus
[SPEAKER_00]: 20% blue light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do see pretty evident They are just on
the picture the reduction in plants height
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into talking about green light
So while plants are green indicating that
[SPEAKER_00]: the green wavelengths are reflected by the
plants This does not mean these are wasted
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths a lot of people think oh,
why should I give them green light?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a waste really That's not the
case green wavelengths of light penetrate
[SPEAKER_00]: deep into the leaf and are absorbed by
certain plant pigments Which are of
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit to the plant chlorophyll may have
reduced absorbance of green wavelengths
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is not the only plant pigment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other plant compounds in the plant
than just chlorophyll We see that
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in areas that have deciduous
trees that change color as the fall time
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches We see an expression of those
pigments when chlorophyll is degraded Now
[SPEAKER_00]: green photons in plant diagnosis So green
photons as part of white light allows
[SPEAKER_00]: growers to see the plants and better
diagnose potential problems It is much
[SPEAKER_00]: easier here to look at the plants under
this kind of full spectrum light Than this
[SPEAKER_00]: high power purpley light to diagnose for
diseases look for potentially nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies and that's Really important
to catch things early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while the plants may grow well under
both This white light would be better to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able for the grower to diagnose plant
problems at a much earlier stage when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: easier to control them So red photons
again in the 640 to 700 nanometer
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelength and plant response What's kind
of looking like with these different
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well red LEDs are among the most efficient
at converting electricity into
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic photons and are relatively
inexpensive This is why you typically see
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of Red LEDs chlorophyll strongly
absorbs red light and this it's effective
[SPEAKER_00]: at photosynthesis Great benefit there many
plants grow under only red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: No blue will have a stretched tall
appearance thin large Leaves, so keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind that just because it's a great
light to what looks like would be a good
[SPEAKER_00]: plant response It's going to cause plants
to have a stretched kind of exaggerated
[SPEAKER_00]: tall appearance leaves might be large.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be thin That could cause some
issues there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why we want to get Plants have
a mix light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a reason why we see a lot of red
light given to plants in growth chambers
[SPEAKER_00]: and indoor grows in general Then to talk
about something here called the far red
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little different than just the red
We're now in that far red which is 700 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 800 nanometers Far red light is in a range
of light that the extreme red end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: visual spectrum Just before you get to the
infrared light Usually regarded as a
[SPEAKER_00]: region between 700 800 nanometers and
wavelengths and is dimly visible to human
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes So keep that in mind that we're kind
of pushing the edge there of the visible
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum Far red and plant response vital
plants respond to far red light Well far
[SPEAKER_00]: red is critical spectrum for plants as
it's utilized in the photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: process and can cause an impact on plants
shape Far red is also perceived by plants
[SPEAKER_00]: photoreceptor the phytochrome which is
important for light detection and also
[SPEAKER_00]: timing and flowering in some plants so
that far red kind of drives the PR to the
[SPEAKER_00]: PFR the Active to inactive form you can
force a plant from the active to inactive
[SPEAKER_00]: form quicker with the addition of far red
light We see here the regular plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: then plant grown with far red how it
definitely increases the height the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet spacing and the stretching of
that plant Now we talked early about light
[SPEAKER_00]: penetration We'll notice the difference
across the different colors of how light
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrates into the leaf for blue We're
looking at light absorbed in the top layer
[SPEAKER_00]: for green the light penetrates deep into
the leaf Red kind of similar to the blue
[SPEAKER_00]: and with light only being absorbed in that
kind of top layer But then that important
[SPEAKER_00]: far red is also penetrating deep into the
leaf as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just important consideration when
we're looking at how these how these
[SPEAKER_00]: Wavelengths might be utilized by the plant
So that blue versus far red Wavelength so
[SPEAKER_00]: far red will enhance cell expansion,
which is essentially the opposite of blue
[SPEAKER_00]: photons It kind of like play off one
another plants grown indoors with 80 to 90
[SPEAKER_00]: percent red light And 10 to 20 percent
blue light are quite compact with small
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves and shorter stems We see the white
versus far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is plus 10 percent far red here It's
very important with lettuce and with other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants as it will cause plants to grow
very tall I want to be mindful of you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, how tall we're letting our plants
get how leggy we might be getting them
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at our seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at shipping seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to grow these large
top-heavy seedlings They may break during
[SPEAKER_00]: transportation with the lettuce here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing our white versus our adding
Our 10% can definitely increase that leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: surface area and that's typically what's
being bought and purchased because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the salad production So that
can really help increase production per
[SPEAKER_00]: plant there by increasing that amount of
surface area This shows seedlings grown at
[SPEAKER_00]: 68 degrees Fahrenheit for four weeks under
LEDs for 18 hours a day at 160 micro moles
[SPEAKER_00]: per square root per second consisting of a
hundred percent red and 50 blue 50 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: red You can see how that morphology
difference is quite staggering with the
[SPEAKER_00]: red being much taller And the mix even
makes a blue and red being much shorter So
[SPEAKER_00]: that quick general summary of everything I
kind of mentioned here Photon color blue
[SPEAKER_00]: green red and far-red and look at the
impact on the plant blue photons inhibit
[SPEAKER_00]: cell expansion Keep them short and squatty
green photons aid with human vision to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to diagnose plants visually for
nutrients or potential disease issues Red
[SPEAKER_00]: photons are very efficient at
photosynthesis far-red photons increase
[SPEAKER_00]: cell expansion Now if you want to learn
more of this is of interest to you To
[SPEAKER_00]: learn a little bit more about this I would
direct you to researching some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientists here to provide you with some
more information They have a great and
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of work out there So by all means
take a look search search them up where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can learn a little bit more About the
impact of photons and wavelengths on plant production
