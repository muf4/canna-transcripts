[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to go over cannabis
genetics, which as this kind of DNA puzzle
[SPEAKER_00]: shows, still a little bit of figuring out
is going on in this category in relation
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the reasons that is,
is genetics have been hidden, like we see
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tracking is poor at best, and due to
the lack of applied molecular genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: many of the names that are thought to be
the same may actually be quite different
[SPEAKER_00]: from one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tracking system uses based more
word of mouth than actual science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we see here with our kind of like
small grotent operation, this can be a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the source of certain genetics or
source of certain varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes there's poor labeling
involved or people sharing material or
[SPEAKER_00]: people thinking they're sharing certain
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, those genetics or those
actual lineages have kind of become a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit hidden, kind of have an idea,
but not really a true tracking system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Phyllis is a company that's committed
to cannabis genetics, and I have them
[SPEAKER_00]: highlighted here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they offer services, I'm going to
mention these three in a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: detail, plant sex test, genotype test,
and the Phyllis Galaxy, which is really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's first look at the plant sex test.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows growers to cull out male
plants from a set block of seeds very
[SPEAKER_00]: early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically we have to grow our plants until
they flower and then be able to tell all
[SPEAKER_00]: male and female flowers, but this allows
us to be culled out much earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using DNA-based method, the presence of a
Y chromosome can be identified early at
[SPEAKER_00]: the seedling stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will allow the elimination of the
worthless plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we can kind of see right here,
here's our male.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one just flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: X and Y chromosome is a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Females have two X chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This reduces the wasted time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can cull up the males early and wasted
time on resources and plants that will not
[SPEAKER_00]: produce any valuable yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost is about $60 per four samples,
which means it may be cost prohibitive in
[SPEAKER_00]: small operations, but if there's large
operations where taking care of those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants can get very expensive,
this is a great way to cull out males,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you're starting from a large
block of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the genotype test, this allows growers
to get a report of their plants' unique
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic makeup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used to identify clone matches
and how the plant material relates to
[SPEAKER_00]: other known cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this information, growers can provide
the cultivars, sorry, prove the cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have and provide people with
information that they have background on
[SPEAKER_00]: what their actual genetics are.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also help make beneficial
breeding decisions if you have a known set
[SPEAKER_00]: of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data collected also gets uploaded into
the galaxy, which I'm going to mention a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit, which is shared collection of
genetics for a community database.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is $295 per sample, especially
for companies that may be shipping out
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be great to incorporate this,
or if you're receiving clones from
[SPEAKER_00]: someone, maybe to request this as a way to
know the actual genetic makeup of the
[SPEAKER_00]: material that you're receiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has galaxies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This contains many data points and may
take a little time to load properly,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I put the link down here at the bottom,
and I highly recommend you take a look at
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just again, be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may take a little while to load.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a large dataset.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest you simply type your name,
like O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush, and see how many different samples
that you can come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Select one, and you will see a report,
and it states, close genetic relatives,
[SPEAKER_00]: novelty score, population profile,
genetic variation, and genetically distant
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: The relatives provides an idea of
immediate and non-immediate relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: The novelty score, how common or rare the
genotype may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind this is a genotype,
the genetics, not phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Population profile breaks down the
estimated presence of six distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: subgroups, such as Skunkberry,
Landerites, O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush, Hemp, and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: The variation, the degree of
heterosegosity, or how stable the cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, distant varieties provides an idea
of what the most genetic different
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties, which may help indicate,
will make interesting crosses in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I highly recommend you take a
look at this website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, give it some time to load,
but type in some varieties, and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see some of the variability, and also some
background information on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this is one step closer to
starting to build a dataset, for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics. Thanks.
