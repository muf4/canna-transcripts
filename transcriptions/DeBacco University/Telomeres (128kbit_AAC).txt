[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at telomeres,
which are shown here as the end caps of
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a nice bright pink contrasting
color here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of a glowing image here in
the black and white, and they're circled
[SPEAKER_00]: and zoomed in on the cartoon image just
above me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why are these important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we looking at them?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's important because these end
caps get shorter with each cell division.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see a cell going through a
series of divisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the telomeres slowly being
degraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of think of this as being
like the eraser on a pencil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more times you kind of go through and
use it, the shorter that they get.
[SPEAKER_00]: An average cell will divide between 50 and
70 times before the cell ends up dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: As each cell divides, the telomeres at the
end get shorter and shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a theory or a limit on how
short the telomeres can get through each
[SPEAKER_00]: cell division.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually, when they're too short,
they're no longer present on the
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome, and that cell has gone through
enough division steps, and that cell will
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally basically die and be replaced,
hopefully, by other cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we kind of have here that showing
that cartoon image of when you were kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of young, you have those nice large end
caps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get older, we see that kind of getting
shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sadly, as we age, you're getting even
shorter to the point here where it can
[SPEAKER_00]: only divide so many times before that
telomere is basically gone, that
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome is unprotected, and that cell
will go through a natural death process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the telomerase is a ribo nuclear
protein, it's an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're looking at protecting the ends
of the chromosomes or end caps,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it goes through the process that we
call reverse transcriptase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This forms DNA from an RNA template,
so it's reverse transcriptase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're forming DNA from that RNA template.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going kind of backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It acts without that DNA template.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has its own RNA template that's stored
inside that's then used to kind of reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: transcribe a DNA enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the end result ends up being that
this DNA is extended each time it's
[SPEAKER_00]: copied.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, other mechanisms restore the
length in germ cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somatic cells, those are your natural body
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germ cells, remember, are your sex cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somatic cells do not have enough telomeres
to keep this process going, so they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: lose that telomere length, and this is
thought to result in that cell's natural
[SPEAKER_00]: death process.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, many cancer cells have actually
found ways or have mechanisms to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the length of this telomerase activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is causing them to become immortal
because if we slowly reduce the telomerase
[SPEAKER_00]: of the chromosome and that cell ends up
dying, well, cancer cells simply just
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the length, kind of put like a
permanent cap over it to keep its length
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent, and therefore resulting can
become immortal because they won't go
[SPEAKER_00]: through this natural death process.
