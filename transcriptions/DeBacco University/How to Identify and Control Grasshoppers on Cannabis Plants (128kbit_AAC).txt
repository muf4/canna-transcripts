[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over how to identify and
[SPEAKER_00]: control grasshoppers on cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into identification
and controlling of grasshoppers on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here, here's one actively on a
cannabis leaf there, looking to probably
[SPEAKER_00]: conduct some sort of damage to that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that description of the grasshoppers,
well, they're visually distinctive
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to many other insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cultivated gardeners don't seem to be
kind of a common sight for egg-laying,
[SPEAKER_00]: so if you're growing in a cultivated
garden, may not see as many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grasshoppers tend to prefer undisturbed
areas, such as pasture areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing cannabis on a larger
scale, might have a better odds of seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: it, particularly if it's next to a large
pasture area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Populations may vary considerably also
from year to year, so keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because you didn't see them last year,
it doesn't mind you won't see them a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different types of grasshoppers,
and there's a many, many different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to provide a general kind of visual
guide just right here with all of them
[SPEAKER_00]: listed, as well as some additional
resources here provided by the USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The presence of weeds in hemp plantings
that support various grasshoppers can
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the likelihood of this pest
pressure on hemp crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that managing of area and local weeds
is important to reduce their population so
[SPEAKER_00]: they're less likely to jump to the
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some grasshoppers specialize on certain
weedy plants, and hemp is not their target
[SPEAKER_00]: plant species, so hopefully they'll just
kind of be a graze feeder and a nuisance
[SPEAKER_00]: more than actual leading to crop complete
failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the feeding and identification of that
feeding of grasshoppers, if you're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: some damage on your plants, grasshoppers
do tend to be stem feeders, and this poses
[SPEAKER_00]: the greatest threat to the cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here gnawing down the stem,
breaking the stem, causing that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: top to fall over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf chewing is a common injury as well,
but it occurs on the stems that can stunt
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, that can cause it to fall over,
that can cause longer term implications
[SPEAKER_00]: and negative implications at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we manage grasshoppers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, control can be difficult while
physical barriers can offer some
[SPEAKER_00]: protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grasshoppers have been known to chew
through protective materials, such as
[SPEAKER_00]: insect netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really want to get in there,
and they're really determined that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, chickens are an excellent natural
predators, but they can often do
[SPEAKER_00]: unintentional damage to your plants as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's that kind of risk reward aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chickens are great for removing
grasshoppers, maybe not necessarily in
[SPEAKER_00]: your cannabis plants, but maybe in those
neighboring weeds or pasture areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them kind of free range in that area
to help control the population there,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's a reduced amount of grasshoppers
that could make it to your cannabis plants.
