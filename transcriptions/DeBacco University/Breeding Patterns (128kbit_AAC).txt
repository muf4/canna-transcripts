[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to investigate
different breeding patterns for different
[SPEAKER_00]: animals and how they go about conceiving
to carry on to the next generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with this variation and
reproduction among vertebrate species and
[SPEAKER_00]: also invertebrates, as we see here with
our grasshoppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So vertebrates are sexual reproduction
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most marine bony fish use external
fertilization, and this is where male and
[SPEAKER_00]: female gametes are released into the water
for fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilization can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where we have our female fish
here, and our male here has the large hook
[SPEAKER_00]: jaw here, so you can tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The salmon will go into very shallow
water, and the female will release eggs in
[SPEAKER_00]: this gravel, and the male will then
release the sperm on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most other vertebrates use what these
grasshoppers do, and that's internal
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilization, where the male gametes are
introduced into the female reproductive
[SPEAKER_00]: tract specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very specific, versus here,
there's many, many eggs produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: in the hopes that some will be able to
become fertilized, and some will make it
[SPEAKER_00]: in the wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, the salmon then will die shortly
after spawning, and that's kind of a good
[SPEAKER_00]: thing because believe it or not,
the small fry or the small fish will feed
[SPEAKER_00]: off the dead salmon so that they can have
initial sources of nutrients in areas that
[SPEAKER_00]: are typically very low in nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, looking at the mammalian species and
breeding patterns, some are seasonal
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others have reproductive cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reproductive cycles are periods of
release of a mature ovum, or basically a
[SPEAKER_00]: mature egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most female mammals have estrous cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: These where females are sexually receptive
to males only around a certain time of
[SPEAKER_00]: ovulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is typically when dogs are in heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when those females are ready
basically for mating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other examples, we have quail,
which are what we call long-day breeders,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sheep, which are short-day breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some are very seasonally influenced
versus the winter versus the summer
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why certain animals can be very
well predicted when they're going to give
[SPEAKER_00]: a litter or give rise to young.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have these very distinctive cycles,
and the females are only receptive to the
[SPEAKER_00]: males at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have, for apes and humans,
females have what we call menstrual
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where females will shed inner
lining of the uterus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can copulate, which means they have
sex at any time during their cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see the evidence here of that cycle
that does occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have that releasing of the egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that period of ovulation,
which is very small, you can notice
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of hormone changes that do
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sense of body temperature is also
altering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is helping the woman is to
conceive to create a favorable environment
[SPEAKER_00]: for that egg to become fertilized and
mature into a zygote.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last part here, cats and rabbits are
unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're what's called induced ovulators,
and they ovulate after a calculation due
[SPEAKER_00]: to LH secretion.
[SPEAKER_00]: LH is just a hormone here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that surge that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what allows cats and rabbits to
kind of multiply so quickly, is that they
[SPEAKER_00]: ovulate only after they have sex,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows them to breed at a very rapid
rate, allowing them to populate areas very quickly.
