[SPEAKER_00]: This Tobacco University video is going to
provide you with an LED grow light guide,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as some considerations before
purchasing due to the popularity of LED
[SPEAKER_00]: lights gaining in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, LED lights are gaining popularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many growers think that LED lights are the
only option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while LED lights are popular,
there may be more options to consider than
[SPEAKER_00]: some growers may realize, even within the
LED light category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there are other competitive light
sources that growers may want to at least
[SPEAKER_00]: consider before investing in their chosen
lighting source for their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just look at the LED light
category here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to use a full-spectrum LED
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants can benefit from more than just the
PAR when it comes to growing and when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're looking at producing secondary
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: PAR is the 400 to 700 nanometers
wavelengths of light, but even below 400
[SPEAKER_00]: and even above 700 is showing some promise
for those secondary compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Avoid high PAR purple LED lights that we
can see located right over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes daily plant checks more
difficult because it's that artificial
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of look to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a limited spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it's more focused on the
photosynthetic spectrum, they are missing
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those PAR readings that go beyond
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are ways you can switch it to a
full white light so you can see your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, take pictures, and be able to
inspect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, these purple lights,
while producing high on a PAR meter,
[SPEAKER_00]: may be missing some of those spectrums
that plants may actually need and utilize
[SPEAKER_00]: to maximize their potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we considering when we're
looking at our LED lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, remember that LED lights produce
less heat, and I stress that means this
[SPEAKER_00]: does not mean no heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: LED lights still produce a fair amount of
heat, but this is less compared to,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, a high-pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Longevity, when we're looking at LED
lights, compared to other light sources,
[SPEAKER_00]: the hours that LED lights produce,
at least 80% of the original output,
[SPEAKER_00]: is typically longer and in some cases,
much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example of one being much longer would
be high-pressure sodium lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get about 80% to about 5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: While LED lights could be up to 75,000
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at purchasing an LED
light, make sure you avoid internal fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the light does require internal fans,
the fan tends to fail, and this can cause
[SPEAKER_00]: overheating and ultimately the light
failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The LED technology of the lighting source
is outlasting some of the motorized fan
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, those mechanical fans,
they fail sooner than the diodes do,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that results in the overheating and
then loss of fixtures or issues in that
[SPEAKER_00]: regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to get one that has natural heat
sinks to cool the lighting source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the coverage area, another important
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers need to check the PPF map,
which is looking at the photon flux area,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically the amount of photons that are
being spread over the growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: For any lights, you want to consider this,
even with LED lights, as there's often
[SPEAKER_00]: less coverage area, than other
high-intensity lights that you may have
[SPEAKER_00]: been utilizing in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also check the suggested mounting height
from the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be different than other
lighting sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often a reduced distance from the plant
tops can also limit the coverage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just want to make sure that you're
allowing all corners and central parts and
[SPEAKER_00]: all areas of your growing space to get the
same intensity of the high-quality light
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plants need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one-to-one replacements are coming on
the market, and those are looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: really one-to-one replacements for high
pressure sodium lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most growing areas, especially flowering
areas, are based off high pressure sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Few LED lights are considered to be a
one-to-one replacement to HPS lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: high pressure sodium lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is especially true for the thousand
watt HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are some models being
developed to allow for this easy
[SPEAKER_00]: replacement as a grower decide to change
from a dominated HPS lighting to an LED
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting source for their grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be ready to pay a high upfront cost
for these types of fixtures and be willing
[SPEAKER_00]: to adjust your growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a side note, I'll have a separate video
on this channel that goes over this
[SPEAKER_00]: one-to-one replacement idea if you're
looking at making a grow room change from
[SPEAKER_00]: high pressure sodium lights to an LED
based light.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than just the lights, you're going to
have to change different aspects of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So search the channel for that video as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking LED customized spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the case where this is an example of
where lighting technology is getting ahead
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant science, knowing the best
lighting spectrum recipe is still being
[SPEAKER_00]: researched.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while it is possible to make changes
to UV light, violet light, blue light,
[SPEAKER_00]: green light, deep red, and cool whites,
while that is all possible because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: LED light technology, knowing the exact
plant science of it or what is best of a
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit for the plants is still being
researched.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is research that does indicate that
UV, ultraviolet light, and far red light
[SPEAKER_00]: does have an impact on plant growth and
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some indication that yes,
this could positively impact your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just haven't hashed out all of the
exact recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be ideal up to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're looking at LED lights,
there are LED panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the most common type of LED
light fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They typically include heat sinks and a
driver as a single unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said heat sinks are a key part.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're usually mounted on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like fins and help cool the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to avoid panels that have fans
that are required for the cooling process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this panel design.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, there's also LED light bars
and they look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the name implies, they are kind of a
bar lights and they're slightly less
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive than the panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bar is a single row of diodes that
come in different spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Single bar should be used in small growing
areas or as an additional supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light source growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shape makes them a good choice for
smaller, particularly rectangular growing
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, shown here is like a four by
two grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple bars linked together can be used
on larger scale operations, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're looking at vertical farming and
the spacing of the bars does help the
[SPEAKER_00]: cooling process as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one here has a lot of metal fins,
again, to act as heat sinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's LED bulbs that we can see
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can be an easy replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone was using the CFL, typical
bulbs there, but growers may use these for
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing and matching spectrums,
but a reflective hood would be recommended
[SPEAKER_00]: to increase the efficiency, even though
these tend to be not the most efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: light source anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be going to look at potentially some of
the other options, but these do exist and
[SPEAKER_00]: be aware again of those high PAR lights
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be used though for supplementing
spectrums, but maybe not as your base
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just some warnings.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at making the switch to
LED lights, the technology is continuing
[SPEAKER_00]: to improve at a rapid rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Current technology is ahead of the plant
science, particularly when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: optimizing plant spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: The coverage area for each light is
important as sometimes the reduced plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to light spacing can limit the coverage
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's distance that you want to keep
those lights from your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost of the light doesn't need to be
considered, since most of the time good
[SPEAKER_00]: lights are not cheap and cheap lights
simply are not effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some research is showing that leaf
temperature can also impact plant
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are switching from a high
intensity light, such as an HPS,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can expect some differences and your
HVAC system will likely need changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm going to have another video
going into the details of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal here is to provide you with a
little bit of background of some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: different LED light classifications you
might be considering to purchase for your
[SPEAKER_00]: growing operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
