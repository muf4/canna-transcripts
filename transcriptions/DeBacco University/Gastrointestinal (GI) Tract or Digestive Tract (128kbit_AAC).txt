[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at the
gastrointestinal tract, often abbreviated
[SPEAKER_00]: GI tract, also known as the digestive
tract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're talking about the GI tract
or the gastrointestinal tract,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at basically a tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that tube has a lot of layers to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a lot of veins and arteries
and a lot of layers to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to look at some of what
occurs in this digestive tract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the basic overview of the
GI tract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see our necessary organs and
basically what each is contributing to the
[SPEAKER_00]: process of digestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it begins in the mouth,
works its way down through the entire GI
[SPEAKER_00]: tract, ultimately exiting out the anus at
the very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's some very important steps that
do occur here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to pause this video and
take a look at some of the summaries of
[SPEAKER_00]: the particular points of the digestive
tract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, we have action of the GI
tract, so what's in general occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just saw there what's occurring at very
specific locations, but in general what's
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, we have the ingestion
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This occurs when material is entering the
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see the horse eating the grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ingestion part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have it first enter that GI
tract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the mechanical processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the crushing, tearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here with the giraffe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically making the materials a
little smaller and easier to move
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the GI tract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we move on to the actual digestion
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the breakdown of food into small
organic components for absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, digestion is not the same as
absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just having this initial kind of
breaking apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: This typically occurs in the stomach and
also the intestines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on, we have secretions,
which are release of water, acids,
[SPEAKER_00]: buffers, enzymes, and salts in the
epithelium of the GI tract and glandular
[SPEAKER_00]: organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in order for this process of
digestion to occur, in order for this
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdown to occur, enzymes have to be
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be secreted at certain points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on the pH of different points of our
GI tract, that will determine what enzymes
[SPEAKER_00]: are released where.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is movement of organic substances,
electrolytes, vitamins, water across the
[SPEAKER_00]: digestive epithelium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if the nutrients only stayed in
our digestive system and didn't get to our
[SPEAKER_00]: actual blood system and into our body,
there would be no point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to have that very important
absorption phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, removal of weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the excretion phase, and that's
where we're just removing bodily fluids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as a general summary of our digestive
system, it is a tube within a tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're basically one long tube with
openings at both ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say, sorry, because that's basically
all it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a distinctive path that it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's different things that
happen to it, of course, along that path.
[SPEAKER_00]: But simply, it enters one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mechanical and chemical processes occur
throughout, and it exits out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other end, so your tube within a tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: The histology structure of the GI tract,
you can see here a little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: A zoom in of the different layers involved
and how there's this intense network of
[SPEAKER_00]: our arteries and our veins and our
different types of tissues, allowing food
[SPEAKER_00]: to easily pass through and also for not
only the digestive process to occur,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also that very important absorption
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That digestion, it's water absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, as we see the same image again here,
cells cannot actively absorb or secrete
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: All movement of water across the lining of
the digestive tract involves down or up
[SPEAKER_00]: osmotic gradients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, osmosis is simply that
movement of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is why the body is so important
at regulating different ion concentrations
[SPEAKER_00]: to determine whether water will move into
or away from certain areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see here some of the secretions
that are occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the estimated volume of that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the digestive endocrine system,
there's hormones, cholecystokinin play
[SPEAKER_00]: important roles in the digestive process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see all of these many different
hormones released at different points
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's also different pH and
different breakdowns occurring at
[SPEAKER_00]: different parts of the digestive system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hormones that play vital roles in several
bodily functions and processes as do
[SPEAKER_00]: certain enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we have the microbial communities
and physiological gradients along the
[SPEAKER_00]: mammalian GI tract.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here in the stomach,
the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon
[SPEAKER_00]: rectum, what our microbial load is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in scientific notation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the actual bacteria that are
living in different regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the oxygen concentration and pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, out of the stomach,
the pH is very low, very minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we work our way through,
the pH will actually increase or raise,
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately to neutral and actually
slightly basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our bile acids will decrease as we work
our way through, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just gives you that idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it is just one long tube,
there are very specific and certain
[SPEAKER_00]: processes occurring at different regions
to maximize the digestive and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: absorption process for the belly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
