[SPEAKER_00]: So welcome to this Tobacco University
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be looking at identifying
chemicals with spectrometry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get into some of the
details, but this is that quick overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a light source, a sample,
we have a dispersion element, we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: detector, and we're going to generate at
the end a spectrum here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we have to understand color
because we're going to be looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: different wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And light is a form of energy and travels
in a wave, and the light's wavelength
[SPEAKER_00]: measured in nanometers, we've made Nm,
determines the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see here the red wavelength has
a red coloration, and then we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: green, and we have the blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all these different wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red has a longer wavelength than the blue
example here, and that allows us the
[SPEAKER_00]: separation of colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the kind of also represented here
in the upper portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the color that you see, so the color
that you're interpreting, if we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at this ladybug here, we're seeing a red
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, white light's coming in,
and this bug is absorbing many of the
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, red wavelength light is being
reflected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that objects typically
selectively absorb specific wavelengths of
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The color you see is the color or
wavelength that is being reflected.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of a white surface,
all white light's coming in, and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths are being also reflected off
that surface, and we interpret that as
[SPEAKER_00]: white coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take a white light and put it in a
prism, you can separate out into the
[SPEAKER_00]: different wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we start seeing colors, we're seeing
the color that is reflected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the basics of kind of the
spectrophotometer is that it measures the
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbance of a solution as light of a
specified wavelength is passed through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here we have a light source that
goes through a lens, and it goes through a
[SPEAKER_00]: prism and basically separates it out into
different wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then have a machine that can select a
very specific wavelength from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're seeing we're selecting that
kind of yellow wavelength here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have our sample solution in a
cuvette, and we have a detector,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have a digital meter or display
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're observing or we're seeing what
gets passed through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what the machine knows,
what was basically sent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're looking at passing it through
the sample, and we're detecting to what is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically passed through that sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does a spectrometer look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is an example of one here,
and they have sensors that determine the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of a specific wavelength of light
is being absorbed by a chemical solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If no light is absorbed, the absorbance
meter will read 0.00.
[SPEAKER_00]: As wavelength is being adjusted,
the absorbance will also change because
[SPEAKER_00]: there'll be a difference in that
absorbance reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Results can be graphed to develop an
absorption spectrum for a given chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does an absorbance spectrum look
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is a very basic example here,
but this simply acts as like a fingerprint
[SPEAKER_00]: for a chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also allow for comparisons to
occur since two different substances to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine if they're the same substance or
if they're the same substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then known to unknown also for a
chemical comparison there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on the absorbance spectrum
generated will tell us the similarity of
[SPEAKER_00]: two substances, particularly if two are
unknown, whether or not they're a match
[SPEAKER_00]: for each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at preparing our
chemicals for the spec analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemicals must be in a liquid form,
which may require dilution, so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: important to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuvettes must be used that match the
experiment, and there's different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: cuvettes available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use distilled or tap water depending on
the material you're being tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, we often will use just the
chemical solvent as what we call a blank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a cuvette that simply has the
chemical solvent, which is being analyzed
[SPEAKER_00]: and dissolved in the known or unknown
sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this allows for that correction of any
potential data noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, proper cuvette handling, so keep in
mind that because this is such a precise
[SPEAKER_00]: procedure, we want to be very careful on
how we're handling our cuvettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to ensure that we're using the
proper cuvette materials for step one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also want to avoid direct
contact when handling the transmission
[SPEAKER_00]: sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about transmission sides,
what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we look at our cuvette's example
here, we can see there's definitely two
[SPEAKER_00]: clear sides and two more opaque sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clear sides are the ones that's going
to be that light's going to be projecting
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to avoid contact with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be sure that before replacing
that into the machine here, we're wiping
[SPEAKER_00]: that cuvette with tissue paper before
placing there to ensure there's nothing on
[SPEAKER_00]: the outside that's going to conflict with
the ability to get an accurate reading of
[SPEAKER_00]: our sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're using the spectrophotometer
here, we want to follow the directions
[SPEAKER_00]: since each is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the basics that apply for all of
them is you want to let the machine warm
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be very short duration or very
long duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're allowing that sufficient
time for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to enter the desired wavelength
that we're going to be studying,
[SPEAKER_00]: insert the cuvette containing a blank
solution, and making sure the clear sides
[SPEAKER_00]: are where the light is passing through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to insert it the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we want to zero that solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to repeat the basic process for
the samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We first start with the blank that kind of
controls any of the solvent, takes out any
[SPEAKER_00]: of that noise, and then we want to proceed
with our samples there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are digital, some will have knobs,
some will have meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're creating that absorbance
spectrum, so with a sample plot,
[SPEAKER_00]: the absorbance versus wavelength,
keeping the sample the same, the
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths will be changed and the
resulting absorption reading should be
[SPEAKER_00]: documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're noticing as we change our
wavelength here in this example,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're also having a change in absorbance
and we're documenting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal here is to determine the number
of peaks the sample may have, which will
[SPEAKER_00]: aid in developing an idea of specifically
what substance we might be dealing with.
