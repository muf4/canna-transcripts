[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at the
importance of documentation, cleanliness,
[SPEAKER_00]: and organization related to grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a nice, well-organized area here
where we have documentation not only on
[SPEAKER_00]: the door, we have it well labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a key card to get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a whiteboard here indicating the
plants that are in there when they were
[SPEAKER_00]: potted up, when they were flipped,
and when they are expected to be
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see track records right here in a
bin located right outside this flower room
[SPEAKER_00]: number four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great way of having this documentation,
cleanliness, and organization all wrapped
[SPEAKER_00]: into one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, documentation is important because it
should be easy to follow in a logical
[SPEAKER_00]: format, shouldn't have to do much thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should just kind of hit the main points
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a nice, organized layout here,
a little description, initials,
[SPEAKER_00]: time, and what was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all tests and times, there should be
an accompanying initials to know who was
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great way to hold accountability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Information should be posted, as you can
see here, easy to access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going into this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: All people should also be aware of the
location of what's called the SDS sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the safety data sheets for
anything that's being applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good things to consider also if you're in
an area and working to know where those
[SPEAKER_00]: are located so that you know what products
are being applied and it's important for
[SPEAKER_00]: health and safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Images can also be included as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be another way to get to document
things, but also include captions and use
[SPEAKER_00]: that as a supplement for this written
documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not only important to document what
you do, but it's also a good idea to know
[SPEAKER_00]: where you expect or at least hope to be
and when.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of predicting the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see here when these plants were
potted up, when they were turned and
[SPEAKER_00]: flipped from veg to flower, and their
anticipated harvest date, and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of plants of different varieties
publicly posted here, also with
[SPEAKER_00]: documentation and binders here that may
correlate with the room as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be also ideas of the bulbs of
the room, how old those are, when they
[SPEAKER_00]: were changed, what the reflectors are
looking like, a whole host of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much information is good to collect so
that you're able to replicate a successful
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern or just one that is not
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleanliness is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It applies to outdoor field-grown plants
as well, so I don't think it's just for
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleanliness should be continual,
not just once a week or every Monday we
[SPEAKER_00]: clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it should be consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And clean does not mean sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean we have to take bleach and
bleach the walls and everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just going through and sweeping up and
collecting everything and putting in a
[SPEAKER_00]: known location is a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tools for defined areas is also a great
suggestion, but there should be steps to
[SPEAKER_00]: disinfect and limit cross-contamination
with those tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple alcohol solution to keep on hand to
be used in regular intervals is
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here kind of a sticky paper,
so when you walk through this door,
[SPEAKER_00]: this captures potentially anything that
might be on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoes or on the soles here of individuals
footwear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, something that should be changed
freely on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not building up and accumulating
a bunch of potential soil particles on
[SPEAKER_00]: here, keeping the area clean as just
another step there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple hygiene, and yes, that is me,
washing hands before entering a grow area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a large area with multiple
rooms, repeat the process as you change
[SPEAKER_00]: from room to room, always trying to limit
potential for contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assume every room you enter is
contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's, quote, not, it'll just keep
you in a good pattern of practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider yourself a carrier of disease,
and you want to limit cross-contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to limit any direct contact
between rooms that you haven't washed up
[SPEAKER_00]: in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, this includes yourself,
tools, and guests that might be visiting
[SPEAKER_00]: your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, wearing a full-body suit here,
the booties, the gloves, the hair net,
[SPEAKER_00]: all this just kind of limits the chance
that if I carry anything, I infect the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that I am visiting and inspecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The environment in general, continually
keep an eye on the environment around your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a designated area where the leaves
are disposed of, and also clean this area
[SPEAKER_00]: out daily to avoid a source of disease in
a grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have a nice bin here where all the
discarded leaves go and just leave it here
[SPEAKER_00]: to be changed once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go through, bag this up, and remove that
on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can have, again, multiple rooms
here, multiple areas of disposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going through and cleaning this up ensures
it isn't breeding disease that gets picked
[SPEAKER_00]: up in the ventilation system and spread
through the entire room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a nice clean floor here as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean and organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the high pressure sodium
lights kind of tint the color a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit, but you can see down this whole row,
very clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also easy to spot potential errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be easy for anyone to follow
this cleanliness and organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know where you may be missing or
running short on something, nutrients in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one plant doesn't look like the others,
what might be going on could be an issue
[SPEAKER_00]: with the emitters or something going on
with the watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean floor also allows early detection of
plant that may be dropping more leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: than normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can just get you to inspect that
plant a little bit more and catch any
[SPEAKER_00]: potential problems early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daily tasks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to change footwear or clothing
when entering your grow area to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check all systems, fans, lights,
CO2, water, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, there's glasses because these are
high pressure sodium lights for grower
[SPEAKER_00]: comfort, and also you can see different
size gloves here to ensure always changing
[SPEAKER_00]: out gloves with each room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the plants, but also don't forget to
check the undersides of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just kind of look at all the tops
of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And be mindful as you're going through and
doing inspections to remove any dead or
[SPEAKER_00]: sick leaves that you notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prevention is better than control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping the area clean is a key to disease
and pest prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: This includes also the blades of the fan,
the water tanks, the walls, the floor,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to just limit it to just
checking one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil surface, the plants, the ceiling,
the walls, the fans, the tools,
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment, even yourself need to be
considered as far as preventing any
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, if you do have a problem room or
one that may be experiencing an issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just chose this picture randomly here,
but if you do have rooms of various
[SPEAKER_00]: cleanliness, always start with the
cleanest rooms first and work your way
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the dirtier rooms or areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help limit the spreading of
disease to your entire operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people want to go to the room that's
got all the disease first, take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but then that disease as soon as on
you and you're transferring that to your
[SPEAKER_00]: other rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always start with the cleanest room and
progress to the dirtiest room so you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not adding any infection,
cross-contaminating those spores that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be in the dirty room into your clean
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this taken into consideration is that
connection between the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: continual documentation, cleanliness,
and organization for an efficient grow
[SPEAKER_00]: operation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
