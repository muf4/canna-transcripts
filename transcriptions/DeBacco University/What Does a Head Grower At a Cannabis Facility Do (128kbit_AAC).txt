[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you have asked yourself or aspire
to be a head grower and wonder exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what their job entails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this Tobacco University video will
go over just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into what does a head
grower at a cannabis facility actually do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, their general job
description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they manage all aspects of
cultivation, including budgeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're head of all growers and all
cultivators, and their job is basically to
[SPEAKER_00]: oversee the crops from the seed all the
way up to and including the harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, their day-to-day activities,
again, will always kind of be a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: variable depending on the size of the
operation where their plants are,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they basically will oversee daily
growing operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they ensure all documentation is
complete and accurate, and documentation
[SPEAKER_00]: is a very important component of the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will also issue corrective and
parentive actions called CAPAs,
[SPEAKER_00]: work with laboratory employees in creating
a production schedule, and maintain and
[SPEAKER_00]: conduct vault inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this might depend on the size
of the operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also responsible for overseering
the cure room operations and conducting
[SPEAKER_00]: employee training from entry level all the
way up to upper level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Create and maintain standard operating
procedures and ensure the safety
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements for staff and product are
maintained.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of like the one that is
responsible for all aspects of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there will be lower entry level
growers and responsible more for the
[SPEAKER_00]: day-to-day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone just call it, quote, grunt work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, the head grower, really all the
responsibility comes down to them at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the qualities that a head grower must
have is typically a bachelor's degree,
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge and experience with the American
herbal pharmacopoeia as far as knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: their practices, extensive knowledge of
the harvest and care of medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana plants in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Requirements are 21 years of age or older,
passive criminal background check,
[SPEAKER_00]: good communication skills, and good
organization skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organization skills are very important
because you need to have the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: document all of the different aspects
regarding the entire growing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the connection of the cannabis
industry, just kind of how this head
[SPEAKER_00]: grower ties in, is that they are the head
of the entire growing operation,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where the name comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, they have oversight over all
other growers and complete control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why the responsibility lands on
their shoulders.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they make a decision, that's why it's
gonna proceed forward, hopefully for the
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's not, it doesn't work out as
favorable, they take the blame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any slight mistake from the head grower
could potentially harm the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So redundancy and quality control are key
in this position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that documentation is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important to be involved with the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, a lot of head growers can get caught
up in a lot of the other aspects of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important for them also to have a
direct plant connections as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as those communication skills to
hear from those that might be lower on the
[SPEAKER_00]: list there, hearing what they're seeing,
making adjustments, catching problems
[SPEAKER_00]: early and preventing them from becoming
larger problems, because ultimately the
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility all comes back to the head
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much for your time,
and I'll see you next time.
