[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBacco University video,
we're going to look at a study that was
[SPEAKER_00]: done on responsive cannabis genotypes
related to concentrations of potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at responsive
cannabis genotypes to potassium supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the research article that
I'll be pulling some information from
[SPEAKER_00]: presented right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to take a look at it in more
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see more of the materials and methods
that they used, but I'm going to provide a
[SPEAKER_00]: general summary here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the plant material,
and this is just what they had used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two medical cannabis cultivars,
genotypes Rural Medic and Desert Queen,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are approved for commercial medical
use in Israel, were used as the model
[SPEAKER_00]: system in the study presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both have indica characteristics and were
selected to represent two distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: RM contains similar concentrations of THC
and CBD, about 5% of each, and DQ,
[SPEAKER_00]: Desert Queen, is a high THC cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants were propagated from cuttings from
a single mother plant in coconut fiber
[SPEAKER_00]: plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the growing conditions for these
plants, the plants were divided into five
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing potassium supply treatments,
15, 60, 100, 175, and 240 parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million, and grown for 30 days under an 18
six hour light to dark photo period under
[SPEAKER_00]: metal halide bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a controlled environment in a growing
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperatures in growing room were 26 and
25 degrees Celsius for day night
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and a relative humidity of 54
and 50% respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irrigation was supplied via drippers with
one dripper per pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The volume of irrigation in each
irrigation pulse was between 250 and 650
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters per pot per day, set to allow
30% of drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilizers were supplied by mitigation,
dissolved in the nutrient solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: at each irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of gives you that great
background of the research and kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions that they were conducting their
research in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the article even goes into more
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So time after potassium treatments,
let's get to some of the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at the irrigation and
solution and then the leachate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the potassium here on the
y-axis and then time after treatment in
[SPEAKER_00]: days on the x-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And overall we can see an irrigation
solution, the potassium stayed relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent as we would expect and the
leachate here for the higher
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations increased over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's basically in the 175 and the
240 parts per million treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the potassium concentration,
the little brackets here mean
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at here,
kind of our leaves are two different
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties and potassium concentrations of
15, 60, 100, 175 and 240 that changes
[SPEAKER_00]: noticeably in the in their morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Images of the youngest fully developed
leaf on the main stem taken 26 days after
[SPEAKER_00]: the initiation of the fertigation regime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see that definitely the low
reading here definitely had a different
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we get to the higher readings,
a little harder to make a distinguishing
[SPEAKER_00]: factor based on visual characteristics
between the various treatments and
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations given.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at the potassium on the
overall plant development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is photographed 26 days after the
initiation of the fertigation regime,
[SPEAKER_00]: much like we saw with the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we're looking at the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still those 15 concentration per million
definitely suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher levels a little harder to tell a
difference, at least based on purely
[SPEAKER_00]: visual characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what were the general results?
[SPEAKER_00]: What were they looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, 15 parts per million of potassium
was insufficient for optimum growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: function in both genotypes and elicit
visual deficiency symptoms that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly see on the images provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: 240 parts per million of potassium proved
excessive and damaging to the development
[SPEAKER_00]: of genotypes royal medic while desert
queen it's simulated rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: restricted shoot and root development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the royal medic, the growth
positive response to increase potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: swine up to 175 parts per million of
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increasing in leaves and root biomass,
the stem diameter and internode elongation
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But increased with further increasing to
that 240 parts per million of potassium,
[SPEAKER_00]: rendering 175 the optimum concentration
for this genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important to realize that adding
more fertilizer in some cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: once you get above that optimum level will
lead to a decrease in your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the desert queen, increasing
potassium supply in the range of 60 to 175
[SPEAKER_00]: parts per million did not affect plant
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly, further increase in case
applied to level of 240 stimulated rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than restricted growth in development in
this genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is again, we're looking at
different genotypes, you can have
[SPEAKER_00]: different fertilizer requirements to
maximize that growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having these studies is great to be able
to act as a comparison, to be able to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at potentially some varieties that you
might be considering.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put here just soil test potassium
recommended potassium levels just in
[SPEAKER_00]: general what might be recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here we're seeing it dialed into a
nutrient specific regime based on actual
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take this into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not growing one of these,
it looks like kind of I would say not
[SPEAKER_00]: going over that 175 would be a good
starting point and then see how the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: respond.
So thank you for watching.
