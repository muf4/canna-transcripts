[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're just going to look at a
brief overview of plant tissue testing and
[SPEAKER_00]: how it kind of relates to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at, you know,
developing an idea of the nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can test the soil or the soilless
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also test the actual plant
material, and that's what this is about,
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual tissue of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're tissue testing,
there's important points of note.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is where you sample is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're sampling at the top, sampling at
the side branch, you're sampling at the
[SPEAKER_00]: lower branch, that can play a role in the
nutrients in that particular plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the stage of that plant in its
development plays a role in the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're sampling from a younger plant
versus an older plant, that can influence
[SPEAKER_00]: where you want to take that sample for the
ideal or best consistent results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the advantage of tissue testing,
you'll know what's actually inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, inside the actual tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can provide a comparison from the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get a better understanding of the
differences that may be occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is the nutrient high in the soil,
but low in the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is something really high in the plant
that may not be in the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: This can help give you a better picture,
a more holistic approach of not only the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, but also how the plant is reacting
to the nutrients you may be feeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the nutrients that may be present or
absent in the soil profile, or even the
[SPEAKER_00]: soilless media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now kind of the challenges, and this is
particularly referring to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that having a standard to compare to.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of other tissue testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take corn and tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of testing to compare to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a little bit hard for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, sending the physical samples and
finding a lab that will take the samples
[SPEAKER_00]: can sometimes be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shipping them in the mail, there's some
potential issues with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, certain labs simply just do not
want to deal with cannabis samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're mindful to call the lab ahead
of time before sending anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: and figure out a way that may work,
because tissue testing can offer a
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable tool to evaluate the nutrients
inside your plant.
