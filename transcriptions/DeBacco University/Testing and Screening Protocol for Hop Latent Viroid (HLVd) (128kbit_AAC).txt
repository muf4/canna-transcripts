[SPEAKER_00]: Growers have been asking and this tobacco
university video will provide the answer
[SPEAKER_00]: for how to go about properly testing and
screening for hoplatin viroid in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's go over the testing and
screening protocol for hoplatin viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, this is another great resource
to kind of look at and provide a link in
[SPEAKER_00]: the description under references and we're
excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go to this podcast
interview style information there,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to provide a summary of this as
well as some other resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So leaves was the standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at taking a sample,
take the leaves and this does still work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to think that that was null and
void, does still work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pedioles of the leaf, which again is this
kind of portion right here, are slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: better than the actual just leaf portions
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get really specific just those actual
portions there that's from the node to the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That petiole is probably the better
portion of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the latest data does indicate an
early accumulation in the roots before it
[SPEAKER_00]: saturates the plant and will show up with
reliability in the leaves and throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as this kind of shows here on the
diagram, here we see the success rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're still seeing, you know,
upper success rates in older growth
[SPEAKER_00]: pedioles, upper clone stem, but look at
those upper and lower root areas near 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So particularly in early areas,
if you can send this root sample to your
[SPEAKER_00]: standard testing lab, might be worthwhile
because it does seem to accumulate at
[SPEAKER_00]: least early on there in a high degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now mother plants, if you're talking two
months or older, four leaf or petiole
[SPEAKER_00]: samples at different areas of the plant
can work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Systematic sampling throughout the canopy
should be performed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root samples can be hard to get and do
physical damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So leaf and pedioles are preferred for the
stage of plant development, not only to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the damage, but also because at
this point, two months or older,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably got very good saturation
throughout the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes about six weeks for that hop late
and hard based on the research I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of saturate that plant and to kind
of become systemically over the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, if you have that plant
that's over two months old, a leaf or
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely a pedial sample, a leaf
including the pedial would be advised
[SPEAKER_00]: because usually you have more roots to
worry about, might be doing more physical
[SPEAKER_00]: damage and you're still going to get a
reliable result.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, if you have a two month or
younger plant, this is where you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: go and target a root sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because the early accumulation is
in this location.
[SPEAKER_00]: The virid load will be elevated,
improving the odds for detection on a
[SPEAKER_00]: younger plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically, younger plants,
easier to get at the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be less of them in total,
but easier to get at them, easier to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: sample and it's going to provide you with
a more accurate result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how often should you be doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What frequency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're going to keep and or clone
the plant, that's something to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ideal window is about every two to
four weeks to ensure continual screening
[SPEAKER_00]: to catch something early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because a plant tests negative,
it may be below detectable levels or it
[SPEAKER_00]: might be a very small viral load,
particularly early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where you can kind of see this
viroid, that plant stress and that viroid
[SPEAKER_00]: become more prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks is best for actively growing
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four weeks best for established plants as
long as there are strict quarantine
[SPEAKER_00]: protocols in place and limiting access,
particularly to your mother plants or your
[SPEAKER_00]: mother room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that plant quarantine, this is if you
bring plants in, there should be at least
[SPEAKER_00]: a 30 day quarantine to allow for proper
evaluation and screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to take a screen sample
when it first comes in and then send
[SPEAKER_00]: another sample off even after that initial
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may require those multiple screenings
to ensure the plants are clean and are
[SPEAKER_00]: brought in as to part of the growing
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing you want to do is take one
plant that's infected, bring it into your
[SPEAKER_00]: operation and have it go through and
infect your entire operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good month, 30 days is a good quarantine
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you get a positive, isolate the
plant, remove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A full plant tag bag and dispose is
advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you kind of put that bag over,
you want to limit your own contact with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover over, basically seal it up,
put it all in the bag and then discard it
[SPEAKER_00]: for this dumpster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, this is transmitted by physical
damage and sap transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you are transferring it into the
bag, you want to eliminate any contact you
[SPEAKER_00]: do have with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're wearing gloves, put those gloves
in the bag and discard everything
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the roots can have some of the
highest viroid loads, so avoid transfer or
contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contact with these as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people just think of the plant,
the petiole, yes, but the roots as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: the substrate, they're growing and you
definitely want to be treating that
[SPEAKER_00]: because that is where some of the highest
amount of virids can be located.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be treating that with
diligent care and making sure you're
[SPEAKER_00]: disposing of that as well with your plant.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
