[SPEAKER_00]: As the title suggests, we'll be comparing
different digestive systems of different
[SPEAKER_00]: animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows a little bit of an extreme
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're comparing the deer to the human,
but we're also going to be comparing
[SPEAKER_00]: different animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting off with just this comparison,
well, depending on the animal's diet,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can affect their digestive system or
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants have very complex carbohydrates,
such as starch and cellulose, which take
[SPEAKER_00]: longer to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example of what a cellulose
molecule looks like, and cotton fibers are
[SPEAKER_00]: a great example of that, one of the purest
natural forms of cellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think if you tried to eat a cotton ball,
you really wouldn't get much nutrients out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a long time to break that
cellulose down.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, compared to a cotton ball,
if we eat a sugar cube, here's a glucose
[SPEAKER_00]: tablet, we would be able to break that
down very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the monomer unit of cellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also, this is a bunch of glucose
molecules linked together.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this linkage here makes it much
more complex and takes a lot longer to
[SPEAKER_00]: break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at some animals here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have rumens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our hindgut and our monogastrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do fall into the monogastrate category
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ruminants, you can see the cows,
the goats, the sheep, and the deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all kind of eat generally the same
diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hindgut fermenters, we're going to talk
about what specifics are for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horses and rabbits are a prime example.
[SPEAKER_00]: In monogastrate, in addition to us,
pigs, cats, and chickens also fall under
[SPEAKER_00]: this category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the ruminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have four compartments to their
stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to break down grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rumen is actually located on the left
side of the cow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has billions of microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: What cows do is they form balls of cud
that do not completely chew the grass they
[SPEAKER_00]: initially eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go through kind of this multiple
chewing step.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever look at the mandible of a cow
here, you see a lot of those very
[SPEAKER_00]: flattened teeth for that kind of
massification, that kind of breakdown of
[SPEAKER_00]: these complex cellulose thin grass fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see some teeth in the front here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, there is a gap between the
molars and the canines and incisors here
[SPEAKER_00]: at the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, ruminants, in a little detail here,
that four stomach, and this is replying to
[SPEAKER_00]: cows, as I showed in that example,
also go to ruminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first two stomachs of the rumen and
the rectal, these contain prokaryotes and
[SPEAKER_00]: protists that are able to digest cellulose
fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see our intake here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of our beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ruminant will actually regurgitate
it's called cud in the form from the
[SPEAKER_00]: rectal as it chews it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will swallow it into a third
stomach called the osmosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This removes the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see cows that go through in the
graze in the morning and then they're kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of laying down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what they're doing is they're kind
of regurgitating some of that food,
[SPEAKER_00]: re-chewing it, and then sending it back
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that cud.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cud then passes into the fourth
stomach in the abomasium, where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: digested by enzymes produced by the
ruminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of this kind of
regurgitating, re-chewing, and re-adding,
[SPEAKER_00]: remixing, and re-putting into different
types of stomach helps them break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, this takes a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we have this multiple stages of
breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't even entered the small
intestine yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why they're able to break down
such complex carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting it in a little bit of perspective
here, ruminant digestion compared to a
[SPEAKER_00]: single stomach digestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remembered, we're kind of the single
stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got carbohydrates, proteins,
fats all entering here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a hydrochloric acid that should be
in the lower case L, pepsin, and then our
[SPEAKER_00]: intestinal enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In ruminants, we have microbes feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have money giving up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have some HCl breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the intestinal enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of methane is produced because we
have a lot of microbe feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very different than our simple monogastric
stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on with our hindgrip
fermenters, these have one simple stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your cecum is responsible for digesting
plant fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to focus on horses here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be up to four feet long in horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: These animals must graze often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And horses tend to get something called
colic, which is a major concern for anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: owning or working with horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colic symptoms, we can see a couple here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All indications that the horse is for
whatever reason not feeling well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it is colic, this can be a result
of a blockage of the digestive tract.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a result of an abdominal pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: A diet poor in water can be a cause of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be caused by a twist in the bowel,
as we see here, or a quick change to
[SPEAKER_00]: pasture grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these can increase the odds of a
horse getting colic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That blockage in the digestive tract could
be fiber that basically gets stuck in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cecum, and that can cause a lot of pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kicking of the belly, excessive rolling,
lying down a lot, just simply not eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these can be signs of a horse that
has colic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at monogastrics, and that's us
included, large complex nutrients to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules are broken down with the use of
a simple stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be very familiar now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our simple stomach with mechanical
and chemical digestion, and we enter the
[SPEAKER_00]: small intestine and go on from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, comparing and contrasting to
monogastrics, humans and herbivores,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as the rabbit, have a monogastric
digestive system.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that does not mean that they have
the same digestive system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rabbit have a small intestine and
cecum enlarged to allow more time to
[SPEAKER_00]: digest plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may remember that from the beginning,
just to go back so you can get this
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison of what falls into what
category, horses and rabbits are in
[SPEAKER_00]: hindgut fermenters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a special division of
monogastric.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rumens have these four chambered
stomachs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, so just a little bit to kind of
keep this all on track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have this enlarged cecum here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's allowing for the increased time to
help break down the salus fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also digest their food twice,
and this helps them to be able to feed
[SPEAKER_00]: more on plant-based diet versus ours,
which is more an omnivore type diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking specifically now at how these
look, we have our insectivore compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: our carnivore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both of these animals are feeding on a
little bit more advanced, if you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: species in the sense of they're not made
of entirely of super complex
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insects and carnivores eating those mostly
meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, you'll notice that their
digestive system is relatively simple and
[SPEAKER_00]: short compared to that of those that are
non-rumens but herbivores.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see initially that comparison between
these two, the much larger and longer
[SPEAKER_00]: digestive system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to flip back for a second,
these have much shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there is a difference between
the two here, but we have the cecum here
[SPEAKER_00]: for the carnivore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The insectivore is just very simple and
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comparing both of these, though,
to the herbivores, you see much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar diet in both organisms of the
rabbit versus the deer, however,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have different digestive tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stomach and cecum are very different
between these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a ruminant here for the deer and
no ruminant present for the rabbit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ruminant also has a noticeable spiral
loop, as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this just increasing the time is
animals able to break down food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an extreme example from an
herbivore to a carnivore, and we could see
[SPEAKER_00]: that distinctive difference in length here
between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: These make for great comparison questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I just gave you a digestive system,
could you infer what that animal may eat
[SPEAKER_00]: and support it with evidence?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's kind of a nice comparison of the
four here just to kind of give you that
[SPEAKER_00]: idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, again, the same kind of images,
some couple key points mentioned here,
[SPEAKER_00]: things to look at and consider if you were
just given one of these, could you
[SPEAKER_00]: identify the animal's diet?
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of gives you that kind of sketch
or that image here, comparison,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of got all the different animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice here the sheep in particular has a
very long small intestine versus the human
[SPEAKER_00]: is much shorter, and the dog compared to
the human.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just pause the video and take a
look at these.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're unfamiliar with any of these
animals are, next slide, provide you with
[SPEAKER_00]: the names so it helps you kind of provide
that comparison between everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, comparing apes to humans,
we have relative items of the stomach and
[SPEAKER_00]: small intestine, the cecum and colon,
and modern humans to the apes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice the relative volume of the
stomach is fairly comparable amongst all
[SPEAKER_00]: of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The small intestine, the gorilla is
definitely much shorter, and the human you
[SPEAKER_00]: see way up on top here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cecum, very similar, and the colon,
notice that the human is much smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes human, the chimpanzee,
the gorilla, so on and so forth as you
[SPEAKER_00]: work your way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I could even kind of take myself and
just kind of leave myself right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just again, another comparison between
apes and humans offers just a glimpse at
[SPEAKER_00]: the animal's diet, and could you be able
to compare if you were given some data how
[SPEAKER_00]: different digestive systems may better
match an animal's main diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
