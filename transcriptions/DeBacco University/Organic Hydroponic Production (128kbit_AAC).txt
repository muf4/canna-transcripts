[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to take a brief look at
organic hydroponic production,
[SPEAKER_00]: so producing a hydroponic growth with
organic-based nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now growing hydroponically and organically
can present some challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic nutrients can take longer to
become plant-available, so in hydroponics
[SPEAKER_00]: where fruits may be only exposed to
nutrient solutions for very short periods
[SPEAKER_00]: of time, this is something to keep in
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic-based products can be less stable
in solution, resulting in a greater chance
[SPEAKER_00]: for potential shift in pH, or EC,
electrical conductivity changes that could
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep these two things in mind,
especially when growing hydroponically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic nutrients can also have more
particulate than other nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can clog systems and lead to more
frequent operation cleanings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is not necessarily a bad
thing, but just keep in mind that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: are switching to more organic-based
nutrient solutions, there's a chance that
[SPEAKER_00]: they might contain more particulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's by requiring you to change filters
more often, or to make sure that the spray
[SPEAKER_00]: nozzles are clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that it may have more of a muddy
or water look to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may cause the roots to potentially
not look pure white.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could have a slight teak kind of
color to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a sign of disease,
but oftentimes if you're using organic
[SPEAKER_00]: production as a very strong deep
coloration to the water, that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: tinge the color of the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not necessarily a bad thing,
just something to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we also want to be mindful that
just because you're growing organically
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't mean you can't pollute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same as chemical fertilizers if
you're not careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So still keeping an eye on the nutrients
that you're adding and knowing how much
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're adding and eliminating runoff
can also keep your plants healthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep your plants doing well, but also not
contributing to environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminations, especially with
hydroponically with a lot of water-based
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be mindful for changing those
solutions out to not just dump them down
[SPEAKER_00]: the drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to try to get the maximum we want
for efficiency of the plant, but also so
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not wasting anything and
contributing to groundwater contamination,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially with phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true for both organic and inorganic
operations, but organics can also pollute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, run those numbers, double-check
just to make sure you're operating in a
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable way.
