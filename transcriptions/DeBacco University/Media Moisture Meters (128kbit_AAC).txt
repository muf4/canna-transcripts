[SPEAKER_00]: So just as the name implies, these media
moisture meters are simply meters that
[SPEAKER_00]: will measure or assess the moisture level
in a given media, and that could be soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: that could be soilless media.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you a reading or an assessment,
a number to go on as far as what that
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture content is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these moisture meters, it's like there
are water monitors for nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: With media, it's important to continually
monitor the soil moisture level at the
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, I should have this
picture here, because you want to think
[SPEAKER_00]: the root zone in kind of a 3D image.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I think about it and not just kind of
a flat, oh, we cut the soil in half and
[SPEAKER_00]: here's our roots, it's a 3D kind of
structure going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how that moisture level is in that
media is important for us as growers to
[SPEAKER_00]: know and understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moisture meters are great tools,
but they need to be calibrated and
[SPEAKER_00]: installed properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only as good as the operator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what we have here for the post
rate, calculating the weight there of a
[SPEAKER_00]: letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that's calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure also our moisture
meters are calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on which one you select or
use, we'll have different calibration
[SPEAKER_00]: procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heat parties need to some way realize
that they do need to be calibrated to get
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate and consistent readings for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to watch the units that they
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some low numbers indicate low moisture,
and this maybe makes more sense to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others have low numbers meaning high
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep this in mind when you're going
through and purchasing one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be aware of the units that it chooses to
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like we have Fahrenheit to Celsius
here, we're looking at the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the same temperature here, but very
different numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also if you're comparing to other
friends or other people that are using
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture meters, be mindful what unit
they're using and what their numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: equate to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you kind of a nice quick
general summary, provide you a table here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water scout, the watermark,
and the attentiometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a picture of them, all three
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they all have their pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water scout is the most expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have the greatest accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have a slower response time than
watermarks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're affordable and offer a good level
of accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attentiometers, they're lower cost,
not as useful in really dry conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: because they only go down eight centibars
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also measures in centibars here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just look at the options.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what operation you have,
what media you might be using,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as which one might be the best fit
for your operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I've seen no growers who have
used all of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just used the water scout.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do feel it is highly accurate when it's
set up properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that stresses the point there
that the moisture sensor is only as good
[SPEAKER_00]: as the way to mount it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you mount it inaccurately,
place it wrong in the grow operation,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will give you false results,
but that's on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take some time, actually read the
instruction manual, make sure they're
[SPEAKER_00]: installed properly, calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some require a soak ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow those procedures and they will give
you accurate readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll provide you with good data to
allow you to know what's going on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
