[SPEAKER_00]: Now here we're going to be looking at
different types of growing containers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can see in this image the wide
variety of containers being grown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we'll look at some things that are a
little bit more commonly used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the common types of
containers are plastic or solid side pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: air pots, fabric pots, grow bags,
biodegradable pots by a couple different
[SPEAKER_00]: names here, and also discuss where square
pots versus round pots may be most
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting off with the obvious,
we have our plastic solid side pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a wide variety here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're considered to be the standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many options in size and shape and
color and thickness.
[SPEAKER_00]: They often have the option of being
reused.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what makes them the kind of
standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of lightweight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're easy to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get in large quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: All options are being reused.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the main reason why these are
considered the standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's other options available
to growers, such as air pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to maximize aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: They induce aeration or pruning of roots
to reduce root circling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, they allow air to come in and
they cause the root tips then to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: dry out and cause those roots tips to dry
out, but then causing increased branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been used a lot in tree
production, as we can see here,
[SPEAKER_00]: to make for easier transplant process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, while there's a zoom in one of
here, they can be used also on a large
[SPEAKER_00]: scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've gone through some different
revisions, but again, in tree production
[SPEAKER_00]: is kind of where they're most commonly
being used now.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are looking at being transplanted,
outgrown, propagated, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fabric pots are smart pots as a name
brand, if you can remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They claim the same benefits as air pots,
but they have the added benefit of easy
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery, storage, and shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because they completely fold down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be most vacuum sealed and many
pots can be shipped in a very small area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're available in very small sizes to,
as you can see here, very large sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think that these fabric pots
are just limited to small little grow
[SPEAKER_00]: bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be grown full size plants in an
outdoor situation, as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pallets are approximately four feet
by four feet, just to give you an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a traditional plastic pot in
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow bags, something a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's potential confusion between fabric
pots and bags, depending on the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow bags are typically made from plastic,
creating a solid sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unlike the fabric pots we saw there,
there's a lot of breathing that can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are typically solid sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this plastic is closer
resemblance of a heavy trash bag than a
[SPEAKER_00]: rigid side of a traditional plastic pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They offer, again, the ease of storage,
reduced shipping costs, and lightweight in
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits associated similar to the fabric
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drawbacks include that reduced usage
life is typically one to three years at
[SPEAKER_00]: one of these grow bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't last forever, and depending
what conditions they are used in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have biodegradable pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to be able to plant the entire
pot to reduce waste and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common types include the peat pot,
or jiffy pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's cow pots, dot pots, and coir pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some common names, jiffy being
probably the most widely known,
[SPEAKER_00]: cow pots being made out of literally cow
manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they see biodegradable, while we have
all the different pot types, the
[SPEAKER_00]: biodegradability does vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here's a field trial I ran
with tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a coir pot here basically did
not degrade at all, even though roots were
[SPEAKER_00]: able to penetrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cow pot almost completely broke down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The jiffy pot did break down, but still
has some of its large components still
[SPEAKER_00]: visible in the field after a growing
season here for tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into the debate of round
versus square.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind that the plants do not
prefer one over the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, to maximize space, the grower may
want to favor one versus the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early in plant development, square pots
are preferred since this allows efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: packing of plants and minimizes empty
space that we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of line all these pots up together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I like the square pots
early on is packing all these together,
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient use of space, and also kind of
keeping that moisture level a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reduces air flow in total
there, keeping all that moisture there in
[SPEAKER_00]: close proximity and also allows these to
be packed under lights efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later in development though is when
transplanting and shape is less of a
[SPEAKER_00]: concern simply because plants are not
growing in a pot to pot kind of situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Round pots are preferred simply because
there'll be less media used for the same
[SPEAKER_00]: basic footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because those plants are going to be
bigger and spread out, those pots aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be touching typically anyway,
so grower can switch over to the round.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though the plants don't really
care which one versus the other,
[SPEAKER_00]: the grower may depending on the situation
and depending on the growth stage of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I like the square pot.
So that's why I like the square pot.
