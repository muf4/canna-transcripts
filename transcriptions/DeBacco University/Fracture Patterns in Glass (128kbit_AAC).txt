[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another video here on Tobacco
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've tuned into one on fracture patterns
in glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to go over some of the
details associated with the fracture
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns so you can better understand how
glass breaks and what it can tell us about
[SPEAKER_00]: what may have happened to cause this to
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, fracture patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glass does have some flexibility when it's
hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's subtle stretching that can
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the force increases though,
fracture lines first appear which may be
[SPEAKER_00]: followed by the glass breaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't necessarily always need the
glass to break to get these fracture
[SPEAKER_00]: lines, but a lot of times it will be
present right before glass breaks and then
[SPEAKER_00]: there will be sometimes artifacts left at
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important to look at some
of the details because those fracture
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns on the broken glass can provide
clues about the direction and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: rate of the impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though this is more of a qualitative
data than more of a quantitative,
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember quantitative looking at
numbers, more of a qualitative kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still can provide some valuable
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at our shattered glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our original glass point.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our direction and point of impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have concentric fractures occurring,
flakes and chips, radial fractures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when the force is applied to the
glass, it'll break in a very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glass begins to break in the opposite
direction of the force.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the force.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the direction that it's breaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's two types of fractures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The radial and the concentric fractures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see some examples of those in
addition to being here on some actual
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces of glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as force is applied to the glass,
a flat piece of glass, what is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as the force is applied near the
surface of the glass, the glass bends like
[SPEAKER_00]: a city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of near the surface under
compression, that is the far surface under
[SPEAKER_00]: tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting this kind of like bulge
to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fracture will start to deflect on the
opposite surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fracture will move towards the near
surface and simultaneously move outward
[SPEAKER_00]: from the central point of the fracture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting to kind of get this expansion
phase from that compression that tension
[SPEAKER_00]: is spreading, in this case, up and down on
this vertical piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fractures that radiate from the
central point are called radial fractures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fracture may stop at this point,
but there is still stress as yet to be
[SPEAKER_00]: released when this force is being applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the far surface is put under
tension at the point of the force,
[SPEAKER_00]: areas around this tension are then
compressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stress causes the tension on or near
the surface of the glass, which can cause
[SPEAKER_00]: fractures on the near surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what's happening,
we can see here in the picture number
[SPEAKER_00]: three, when that's occurring, we have this
compression, we have this tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we have that bending, we're having
these other points of high stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's causing these fracture
points, these kind of weak points to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop within the piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're talking over a larger area,
we're getting a pattern that is beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, primary radial fractures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at some of the options here,
when glass breaks, the fracture patterns
[SPEAKER_00]: form on the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breaks called primary radial fractures are
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those radial fractures we can see here
are kind of like the points that literally
[SPEAKER_00]: radiate outwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: These fractures start at the point of
impact and then radiate like spokes of a
[SPEAKER_00]: wheel outward from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we kind of see that
starburst effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: These radial fractures form on the side
opposite the point of impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see a great depiction of them
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These kind of sideways ones here are going
to be the concentric fractures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now we're focusing on those
radial ones, those kind of like sunbeam
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those concentric fractures, so those next
kind of fractures that do occur as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The radial ones we talked about,
those lines, now we're looking at the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of going in a circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also secondary fractures,
can be referred to as secondary fractures
[SPEAKER_00]: that form.
[SPEAKER_00]: These fractures take the form of
concentric circles around the point of
[SPEAKER_00]: impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why sometimes they're called
concentric.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of have that ring kind of
appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: These concentric circles have the same
center.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see them also clearly evident
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These concentric circles at the same side
of the glass as the point of impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's important too to try to
make note of what side of the glass,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can, in an investigation,
what side was the inside or the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the four rule for determining the
side of impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's looking at the kind of catchy
term here where ridge lines on radial
[SPEAKER_00]: fractures are at right angles to the rear,
with the side opposite of the impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could look, see if we look really
closely, you can see that fracture
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation direction here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are exceptions to these rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are sadly with many rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exceptions are tempered glass,
dices without forming these ridges because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the way that it's made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also very small windows held tightly in a
frame that do not bend or bulge very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those can kind of avoid this rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Windows broken by heat or an explosion
have really no point of impact kind of not
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing this rule to be applied to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we have a bullet hole in glass,
well, this is where the projectile hits
[SPEAKER_00]: the glass surface and the glass bends and
energy dispersing from the point causes
[SPEAKER_00]: radial fractures to occur on the side of
glass opposite the point of impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's just a prime example here,
a vertical piece of glass bullet traveling
[SPEAKER_00]: from the left side to the right side and
what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stress marks on the edges of the
radial fracture can conform in a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: way which shows the direction of the
impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stress marks are curved in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the one end of the curve runs parallel
to the glass surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other end of the curve runs
perpendicular to the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we kind of see these radial
fractures indicated here, we also have
[SPEAKER_00]: these concentric fractures here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's looking straight on piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take that glass and turn it to the
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see is located right over on this
side here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now object entry and exit points that can
be very important when trying to determine
[SPEAKER_00]: whether the bullet came into the car or
out of the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Waves of energy from the projectile
reverberate from the point of impact
[SPEAKER_00]: causing the glass to fracture in a cone
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: The side of glass that has stress marks
which are parallel to the surface is the
[SPEAKER_00]: side which sustained the initial impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result is small entrance hole in a
larger exit hole in the glass if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: able to compare both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surrounding the hole made by the
projectile there will be concentric rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice the concentric fracture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important to take a look at
those to be able to determine in this case
[SPEAKER_00]: whether the bullet came into the car or
exited out of the car through the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now successive penetrations of glass here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there have been successful
penetrations of glass it's frequently
[SPEAKER_00]: possible to determine the sequence of
impact by observing the existing fracture
[SPEAKER_00]: lines and their points of termination.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fracture always terminates at an
existing line of fracture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can kind of be important if we
have multiple bullet holes going into a
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try and determine which one was fired
first which was the first point of entry,
[SPEAKER_00]: second, third and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can help then determine the order which
can then help determine if we look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: interior of a room for example where we'd
be looking for bullets and where that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of person if they were shot or had a fatal
wound to them where they may have been
[SPEAKER_00]: placed and what bullet caused that sadly
that death to potentially occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now lastly we have breakage of glass from
fire as I mentioned this was a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: different and we see an image of that
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during fire glass may break as a result
of heat fracturing which produces a
[SPEAKER_00]: different pattern and impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wavy fracture lines develop in glass that
have been exposed to high heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glass will tend to break toward the region
of higher temperature and if the glass was
[SPEAKER_00]: not broken before the fire there will be
no radial or concentric circle fraction
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns in the glass that is broken by
very high heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see that textured like look to
the pattern here of breakage of glass
[SPEAKER_00]: during fire and that can be very important
for arson determining where that fireman
[SPEAKER_00]: located the heat of that fire but again
that glass will be fractured but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have a very different and
characteristic look if it was a result of
[SPEAKER_00]: heat than if it was a result of impact.
