[SPEAKER_00]: You may have heard about the screen of
green method of cannabis pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you want to learn more,
this Tobacco University video is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over the screen of
green pruning method, typically referred
[SPEAKER_00]: to as SCROG, method for cannabis
production here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see some setups right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the name implies, it does involve
some sort of mesh screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the production for indoor
method, shall we say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Screen of green, or SCROG, is very
productive and is an easy way to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors when the number of plants may be
restricted by laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it allows you really to take one plant
and kind of maximize its area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that the screen of green
method is not to be confused with the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: of green method, which has more plants and
does not really involve training,
[SPEAKER_00]: as this method does.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn more about the seed
of green, check out Tobacco University
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some detail on that method.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this method, though, a screen is
typically used to support the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while it may not be a natural pruning
method, it can maximize a single plant
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's kind of an example of five days
of growth here, here on the left,
[SPEAKER_00]: and five days later, what the plants can
look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did mention this is showing indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also be done, not so common,
but can also be done in an outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: situation as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the screen mesh and placement of that
mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is a SCROG?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the screen of green?
[SPEAKER_00]: A screen that is the main character of
this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see made of many different
materials, but all those materials will be
[SPEAKER_00]: sturdy materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: It commonly has wire to support the plant
canopy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can be mesh, can be ropes here,
but we want to have some sort of structure
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mesh of the screen should be at least
two inches by two inches and up to four
[SPEAKER_00]: inches by four inches to allow for ease of
plant growth as well as support.
[SPEAKER_00]: The placement of the screen is determined
by the lights used, strain being grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: and training design chosen by the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, exactly where that's placed will
be grower dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see the importance of air
circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you see the fan down here,
as well as a monitor down in this
[SPEAKER_00]: location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many different styles of screening
materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some use a plastic netting or mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others use stronger material like wire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concrete wire is a good option versus
chicken wire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chicken wire is a little too fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: An area there could be used, but again,
wouldn't be my first choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers use 50 watt HBS per square
foot target for their screen to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: an idea of the leaf area to lighting watts
coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you want to see the following watts to
screen size and light distance
[SPEAKER_00]: suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, these are only suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you're growing a typical kind
of thousand watt, I'm going to keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: about 24 inches away plus, and you want to
have about a four and a half by four and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half screen size just to give you an idea
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the wattage of lighting you may have
and the screen size you might be looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at instituting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the light dispersion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at the light,
how are we going to disperse that light?
[SPEAKER_00]: To maximize the space and dispersion of
the light to determine how close the light
[SPEAKER_00]: can get to the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind, as I pointed out
earlier, do not forget about air
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that distances should be checked with
a PAR meter to ensure consistent light
[SPEAKER_00]: intensities across the canopy,
regardless of your chosen light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure that all of the
areas here are getting an even and equal
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of light in one of any hot spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the plant number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant numbers are based on how much
space the borer wants to train each plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to take up.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in general, the goal is to limit
the plant number and maximize the space
[SPEAKER_00]: each plant takes up with this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of the complete opposite or contrast
of the sea of green method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less plants do require a longer time into
vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: More plants allows for shorter vegetative
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's again, characteristics of the sea
of green.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the screen of green.
[SPEAKER_00]: As growers become more skilled,
they can often reduce the number of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to be grown in the same square foot area,
because a lot of it comes down to,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we can see here, the training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typical area for a plant is one to four
square feet, depending on the duration of
[SPEAKER_00]: veg and experience of the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another reason why it's so
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: If growers are a limited number of plants
they can grow, the screen of green allows
[SPEAKER_00]: them to cover more area for each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now timing is critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider we say more experienced growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timing the flip to flower that 12 hours of
light, 12 hours of dark is critical to
[SPEAKER_00]: maximizing the area for each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general rule is to wait until the
screen area is about 70 to 80% full before
[SPEAKER_00]: a grower decides to flip their plants to
that flowering photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exact timing can be partially strain
dependent, since we're keeping records is
[SPEAKER_00]: a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now training the plants, you want to start
typically allowing four to six inches to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow above the screen height.
[SPEAKER_00]: This acts as the plant material to be
trained by pulling the branches back under
[SPEAKER_00]: the screen in a horizontal orientation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going under the screen is advised as this
limits the need for additional support to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the plants in place, but it's more
difficult if the mesh is very fine
[SPEAKER_00]: screening material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try that two to four inch mesh screening
is recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an ongoing process of branch
training to direct the plants to take up
[SPEAKER_00]: the empty or gap spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers need to be aware of where those
gap spaces are and where they can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: direct those branches to go, so you don't
have any empty spaces because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: paying for that light anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you want to keep the pruning to a
minimum as you want to have as many
[SPEAKER_00]: branches to fill the screen area as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shows a great kind of under
canopy view here of what kind of it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like under the screen where there's no
leaves, but we can see a lot of branches,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of twisting, turning to again to
maximize that screen coverage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're pruning those leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pruning leaves should be done if the leaf
is shaded, a bud site since the main goal
[SPEAKER_00]: is to increase the light intensity on the
actual buds, which will overall will help
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, do so in moderation, especially
early in the training process to not
[SPEAKER_00]: further stress the plant, potentially
stunt its growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is where timing comes into
play a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is again where grower experience
plays into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with this screen of green with clones
or seeds or both, some growers believe
[SPEAKER_00]: that clones are the only way to go with
this pruning style.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while clones may be a little bit more
predictable, it does not mean this method
[SPEAKER_00]: is limited only to clone starting
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to the time investment with the
training process, if you're using seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seed would strongly be
encouraged, but keep an eye out still for
[SPEAKER_00]: that one in a hundred that might be male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you spend a lot of time pruning and
training that before you can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't be wasting your time pruning
or training a male plant that ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: will just be discarded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not forget about ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is very important with this
method above the plants as well as below
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants because you're going to
establish a leaf canopy pretty tightly
[SPEAKER_00]: through that screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important not to forget about the
ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The screen will often act as a physical
barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So above and below the canopy ventilation
should be considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the fan here for above,
also fans for lower advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes this will require two separate
fans, even in small spaces, because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: creating basically this physical barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, when you're looking at this
method, looking at the plant hormone
[SPEAKER_00]: influence, well, this does increase the
meristem regions and requires pruning with
[SPEAKER_00]: the intention of maximizing branching of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here one plant, but a lot of
different branch points coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Removing the apical meristem or pinching
reduces the natural oxygen levels
[SPEAKER_00]: resulting in elongation and increase in
side branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that may be advised to help
increase the amount of branching so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get maximum coverage area of your
screen and maximize the area that your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant will take up to limit the number of
plants you can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, a little pruning, a little
advanced placement of the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This method can be very productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's commonly used.
[SPEAKER_00]: But lastly, don't forget about that
ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you decrease the odds of getting
diseases building up in your plants.
