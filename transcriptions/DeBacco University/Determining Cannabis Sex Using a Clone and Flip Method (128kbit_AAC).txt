[SPEAKER_00]: On this Tobacco University video,
we'll be looking at determining cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: sex using a clone and flip method.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very simple method that anyone
can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also helps refine one's ability to go
through and do cloning, but this can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: very important process to be able to
determine whether you're going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: male plant or a female plant and really
hopefully reduce the care that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: give to your plants that are male so that
you can focus on those that are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be high cannabinoid producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the video here
to show you how to go about this clone and
[SPEAKER_00]: flip method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, why would you want to
know whether your plant was male or female
[SPEAKER_00]: to begin with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, keep in mind that the male plants
are going to produce pollen and really are
[SPEAKER_00]: only desirable by breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Female plants will produce high amounts of
cannabinoids and those tend to be
[SPEAKER_00]: desirable by growers looking to produce
high chemical and terpene deaths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most growers are looking for female
plants, but early on before flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very difficult to tell whether you
have a male plant or a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to take care of it, and that
could be wasted resources if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing a male plant that you're not going
to have any return on investment at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're going through cloning our
plant, the cloning process is the same as
[SPEAKER_00]: if we plan was to propagate the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a good cloning process or
want to refine that, this is a method that
[SPEAKER_00]: can help you with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers should take an early branch from a
plant to be able to determine the gender
[SPEAKER_00]: before pre-flowers develop naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to be done very early on
in the plant growing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the goal is to ensure that this
is a quick process since growers want to
[SPEAKER_00]: know what plants to cull and which ones to
keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that you're also labeling
and tagging everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike traditional cloning, the photo
period for the clones or in the clone room
[SPEAKER_00]: should be under a 12-12, 12 hours late and
12 hours dark flowering duration so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can be able to determine or force flowers
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can be able to determine whether
they have a male or female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to talk about forcing flowers
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this kind of term forcing flowers
referred to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the flowering photo period will
induce flower formation and this can be
[SPEAKER_00]: very early on in a plant's life cycle or
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal since the morphology of the
flower produced will indicate the gender
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to recognize those flowers
early on will definitely be advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping records is important so growers
know what branch or clone matches,
[SPEAKER_00]: what stock or original plant was utilized
to be able to match that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're talking about on a very small
level, we can see the arrow pointing right
[SPEAKER_00]: here as well as flowers here, both of
these referring to or showing female
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do these differ compared to male
flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we see them side by side,
you can see right here, this is what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for in flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over on this side here, we can see that
these are all male flowers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the kind of pollen sacs that
will develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, we see the female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see these white, wispy cat-like
whiskers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a high surface area and ultimately
these would capture the pollen produced by
[SPEAKER_00]: the male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you kind of see them side by side,
the morphologies or how they look very
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that early you can
identify these.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing a male plant,
you can cull that plant and go back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: original and get rid of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're focusing all your time,
energy and resources on the plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: will produce high cannabinoids,
which will be those that we're looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: that have female flowers morphology.
