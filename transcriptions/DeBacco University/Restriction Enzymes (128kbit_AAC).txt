[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be looking at
restriction enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now enzymes, as you may remember from our
previous units, can break something apart
[SPEAKER_00]: or put something together.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, they're going to be
separating something, and that something
[SPEAKER_00]: is DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be breaking apart
nucleotides at very specific sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a restriction enzyme doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So restriction enzymes, they bind to
specific short sequences, only four to six
[SPEAKER_00]: bases long in a DNA sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nucleotide sequence, what's
interesting in both DNA strands is
[SPEAKER_00]: identical when read in opposite
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here, G-A-A-T-T-C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you read it in this direction,
G-A-T-T-C read the same in opposite
[SPEAKER_00]: directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different restriction enzymes,
and they basically look for different
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition sites that they're going to
cut the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example here, we have our DNA,
our HINDI3 restriction enzyme,
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting it right here, resulting in two
sections now of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is another example here for the
ECO-R1 restriction enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most restriction enzymes cut the DNA in
staggered fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This causes, generates sticky ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this term sticky ends means is they
want to kind of rejoin together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to rebind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to be kind of left hanging out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ends pair with any other DNA
fragment and generate some of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're pairing it together,
DNA ligase again comes back and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: what's linking our DNA together to form
our double-stranded back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sticky ends versus blunt ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sticky ends have sections that overlap
and have bases attached, which results in
[SPEAKER_00]: the likelihood they will rejoin with
complementary base pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, think about it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little green line, if we separate it
out here, when it was called sticky ends,
[SPEAKER_00]: this end is going to kind of want to stick
back to this end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contrary to that, we have something called
blunt ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these have limited contact in the
direct cuts, just cutting the DNA right
[SPEAKER_00]: here in this sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, these sticky ends have a little bit
more of an area where we could be binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blunt ends are just going to be like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to want to rejoin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit harder for them to
rejoin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where here, our sticky ends have a larger
area that wants to bind, and that's what's
[SPEAKER_00]: causing the sticky part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Restriction enzymes are specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an important fact here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a change in just one of the
base pairs of an ECO-R1 site, and again,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just a restriction enzyme,
the codon will be changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can result in the loss of a cut site
along the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning, this ECO-R1, these four to
six-ish bases, depending on what
[SPEAKER_00]: restriction enzyme we're looking at,
they are looking for a very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't get that very specific
sequence, you get a mutation in one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may lose a cut site or generate a cut
site in somewhere else along the DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where you do not want to have a
mutation occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Restriction enzymes that what they're
actually used for, they defend against
[SPEAKER_00]: infectious agents like viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enzymes that cleave or cut up DNA are
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If foreign DNA gets put into a cell,
we have our bacterial genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our viral genome here being
injected into the cell with the virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cells naturally generate these
restriction enzymes to go through,
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize this as a foreign DNA,
and chop it up before it can reroute all
[SPEAKER_00]: the machinery of that cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's important to have these.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about them in relation
to how they're used for biotechnology,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they are, in the natural sense,
they're not completely man-made,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are used to chop up what would be
invading DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examples of restriction enzymes,
you don't have to memorize those.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just some ones that are very
commonly used and where they come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: ECO-R1 and HINDI-3, I know are very
common.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used those in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the specific sequences that
they look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, our five prime and three prime
regions, we talked about DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This orients yourself in the DNA,
and they each have a very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition sequence, which will be
important for where it's specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: going to cut.
