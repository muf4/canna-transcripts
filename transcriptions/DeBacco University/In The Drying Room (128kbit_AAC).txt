[SPEAKER_00]: So I've talked about the importance of
drying candidates properly, so I think I
[SPEAKER_00]: should take you inside the drying room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while drying can occur outdoors,
it is definitely not advised because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the variability that can occur,
the rain, the humidity, the fog,
[SPEAKER_00]: not a great area to allow efficient
drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, it's done in a room with
controlled conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go over what those conditions
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important to have a clean
room with excellent environmental control,
[SPEAKER_00]: want to have tight regulations over the
temperature, typically around 65 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit, 18 degrees Celsius,
and humidity starting at about 45% and
[SPEAKER_00]: decreasing throughout the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important also that this room has
very little light, that's at least on,
[SPEAKER_00]: other than when someone's in there
inspecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a good idea to have even air
circulation, but do not have a fan
[SPEAKER_00]: directly blowing on the drying buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of want to keep the air just moving
in the room, but not in any one hot spot
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monitoring the conditions is definitely
advised because this will have a great
[SPEAKER_00]: impact on your final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Integrating a monitoring system that can
ensure consistent conditions will improve
[SPEAKER_00]: the dry room conditions and help ensure a
consistent product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a way of monitoring and checking
and tracking are all systems definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: well advised for the dry room here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the placement of those buds can be
put on screens that are not surrounded by
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves to keep the drying process even and
consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the name of the game
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have anything all piled
up in one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see all of these different rungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all pretty much one bud thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not really piled on top of one
another very deep to allow that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: even drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically these screen structures are hung
from the ceiling to allow good air
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's multiple in this room
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers, this is not an example one,
but some growers like invertible racks,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can help avoid flat spots and save
labor while increasing the overall air
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What these invertible racks allow them
growers to do is they're all sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can literally, there's a hanger here
and a hanger on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can take this whole rack,
flip it upside down and rehang it now from
[SPEAKER_00]: what was previously the bottom to help
increase the tumbling of those buds at
[SPEAKER_00]: least once to allow for better air
circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be sure to label each harvest
screen with a date, variety, and person
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the harvesting as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inspect daily to ensure the room
conditions and evidence for even drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that person of harvesting is also
important to tell how the buds were
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmed potentially or how they're drying
or how they were placed and also knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: the cultivar and the variety and when it
was harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: A way to determine the degree of dryness
or they're ready for the curing process is
[SPEAKER_00]: to do something called a stem test.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take the area near the buds and you
try to bend the stem area, if it bends,
[SPEAKER_00]: then there's still some dry time required
and if it snaps, you're ready for the
[SPEAKER_00]: curing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Larger, denser buds may take a little
longer to completely dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So double check the moisture content on
these even when the majority of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: buds may be dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those may have to just go a little bit
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now dry time, freshly harvested products
should be dried and ready for packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: process in about seven to 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some can cut it as low as five to seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically going over 10 is not advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is a final moisture content
between 12 and 15%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you harvest here on Friday the 20th,
you're looking at seven to 10 days would
[SPEAKER_00]: be your ideal dry time window to get the
maximum amount of time for profit
[SPEAKER_00]: producing the highest quality buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the dry room, we mentioned some
conditions you want to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to avoid some conditions,
particularly light, UV light in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want to have a lot of that in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat above 80 degrees Fahrenheit or 26
degrees Celsius and friction, which
[SPEAKER_00]: removes a lot of the resins, meaning you
don't want to put the buds on this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: screen and then shake it all around to get
them to dry because that could remove a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the resins and reduce the overall
quality there of the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this goes over some conditions that you
should have in the dry room, what you
[SPEAKER_00]: should look for, and some conditions you
should be avoiding to allow high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: buds for your harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get started.
Let's get started.
Let's get started.
