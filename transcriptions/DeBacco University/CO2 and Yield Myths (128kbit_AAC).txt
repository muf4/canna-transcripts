[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, CO2 and yield myths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of kind of mysteries
sometimes around CO2, and there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: myths and kind of rumors about people who
are looking at supplementing with that and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the benefits that are claimed and
made about regarding carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, yields are not always
increased with CO2, so that goes against a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot what you may hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, add CO2 and you'll get more yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, precision addition of CO2 to a groom
can dramatically increase your yields,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this assumes that all other
factors such as water, light, and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients are not limiting factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is if you're not feeding
your plants right, and they're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient-hungry, adding CO2 is not going
to help them at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if your light isn't intense enough
and you're not getting enough light,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that could also, by adding CO2,
not help increase yields at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some girls who run a minimum amount of
light to save money could reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity, could be kind of playing right
along the minimum light that they can give
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, or lights are too far away will
see poor results due to light being a
[SPEAKER_00]: limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just one example of adding CO2
and not getting an increase in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make sure everything else is
maximized, such as your water,
[SPEAKER_00]: your light, and your nutrients before you
consider adding carbon dioxide enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now CO2 levels and world food production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So increasing CO2 levels, which we can see
here, a graph depicting CO2 levels from
[SPEAKER_00]: 1958 to 2009 measured out in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a general trend here,
vastly increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So increasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere
will increase world food production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often something that's stated
because, hey, look, if I add more carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide, I'll be getting bigger plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that only holds true if the limiting
factor is actually the carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: levels and not the water or nutrients
those plants are growing under.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here with a tree, giving an
ambient, which is about 400 parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million, and then increasing that by 150
and over 300 and over 450 from the
[SPEAKER_00]: ambient, so this would be about 850.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that there can be an increase
in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, that means that or that assumes
that water and nutrients are not limiting
[SPEAKER_00]: factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could impact world food production
in the sense that water is often limiting
[SPEAKER_00]: in many areas and also nutrients in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't necessarily mean increasing
CO2 levels will automatically lead to an
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in world food production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common myths about CO2 related to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, CO2 does not increase the percentage
of cannabinoids, THC, or CBD in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can increase the volume of cannabinoids
produced, but it doesn't increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the plant's going to produce 12% CBD
and you add CO2, it's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically produce 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to increase the volume simply
because you'll have more plant material
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 results in that more plant material,
which can result in more total or more
[SPEAKER_00]: volume of cannabinoids, but it will not
change the percentage of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it won't make a plant more potent,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another myth there of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CO2 can provide some great things
regarding plants, but it is not the one
[SPEAKER_00]: cure-all fix-all.
