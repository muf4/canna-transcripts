[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in learning more
about drip irrigation, this DeBaco
[SPEAKER_00]: University video is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as we see in the picture here,
let's look at drip irrigation equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: for outdoor cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, understanding with drip
irrigation is it can be large scale or it
[SPEAKER_00]: can be small scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to know how many plants you
want to support with your system and also
[SPEAKER_00]: what the layout of those plants will be
because it'll factor into the way you
[SPEAKER_00]: design your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: General recommendations will be provided
which will include equipment that is
[SPEAKER_00]: needed no matter the size of the operation
because whether you're small scale or
[SPEAKER_00]: large scale, there's certain things with
drip irrigation you need to have to make
[SPEAKER_00]: the system work properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what do you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a filter and there's high pressure
filters which will filter out dirt and
[SPEAKER_00]: other foreign objects with a long usable
lifespan, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having stainless steel screen and heavy
reinforced frame allow for reusability and
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum durability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is important especially when out
in the field application because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be getting a lot of stresses put
on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have your filter fail or
break because it could jeopardize the very
[SPEAKER_00]: small holes that you have in your drip
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind there are different sizes and
styles of filters allowing for the proper
[SPEAKER_00]: one to be selected for the intended
application that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are different mesh sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically you'll find 155 or 200 mesh
filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the 200 mesh filter being the
recommendation for drip irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So others might be cheaper, might be other
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd recommend going with the 200 mesh if
you're looking at drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different flow rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ensure that the filter is not the
restriction on the system and typically
[SPEAKER_00]: you can upsize the filter but make sure
you're matching it with the size piping
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have for your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with looking at the system,
we also have a PSI regular pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially pounds per square inch
regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: For drip irrigation, 10 PSI regular is
necessary to avoid blowing up the drip
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think you can get away with it,
you might get away for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going much over 10,
you risk the chance of blowing up the
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it basically sounds like a gunshot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely don't want to be breaking
your lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 PSI is kind of the PSI recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting one that can operate under
constant pressure is recommended as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seem to be a little heavier duty and
they may cost a little bit more initially
[SPEAKER_00]: but can be worth it in the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ensure that the inlet and outlet sizes
match the pipe or tubing that you intend
[SPEAKER_00]: on using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see the one pictured right
here, a little bit of the internals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that you need to be aware of all the
internals but just so you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is kind of going on in that filter or
in that regulator I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main line tubing, this is another
very critical area and we see that right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very large in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be black, it can be white,
doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is important is the diameter
because that will be based on the needed
[SPEAKER_00]: flow rate that can be supplied by the
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the exact tubing you will use
because many main lines either are not
[SPEAKER_00]: rated for use under constant pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it must be installed after automated
timers or valves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all tubing is normally sized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning there's no industry standard
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Refer to the inside diameter or the
outside diameter or the ID or the OD
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements for the exact tubing size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we notice here with this large
oversize is this is allowing a very large
[SPEAKER_00]: field to be supported potentially by
limiting the number of valves that are
[SPEAKER_00]: needed or the number of zones that are
needed to be allocated.
[SPEAKER_00]: With drip irrigation there are important
fittings to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So drip irrigation does need proper
fittings to allow for proper connections
[SPEAKER_00]: and delivery of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Key fittings apart from effective system
include what's called the tape lock barb
[SPEAKER_00]: fitting as you can see here where this
gets punched into the main line and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the drip tubing will attach here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have it here with a valve or we can
just have it free flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drip tape end plug, particularly
important with things like thicker mill
[SPEAKER_00]: ratings of drip tape and it can be a
foldable type or kind of a plug that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: in at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: On thinner types some growers may tighten
a knot but this is a more professional
[SPEAKER_00]: looking and offers a very consistent and
really eliminates water loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again the grip sleeve end here,
different versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most growers now are going with this type
here and then there's the tape lock
[SPEAKER_00]: coupler which is basically what happens or
what you need to have on hand when you hit
[SPEAKER_00]: the drip irrigation with a sharp tool or
break one of the lines there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically you cut the area there,
splice this in and your drip irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: will flow as normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a valve option if that's
fitting for your operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the drip tape itself is how the water
is actually delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think of it as precisely leaky
hose even if it's a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does allow for controlled amount of
water to be delivered based on
[SPEAKER_00]: calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another video here in Tobacco
University to go over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The benefits of drip tape, the reason why
it's so popular is it's very efficient at
[SPEAKER_00]: watering, allows for uniform water
delivery, the material is durable and can
[SPEAKER_00]: last for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get the thicker 15 mil for example
and it can resist clogging in particular
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're using a filter ahead of the
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used above or below ground as
well so it offers some different
[SPEAKER_00]: installation methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I say precisely leaky hose,
it's a little bit more complicated than
[SPEAKER_00]: just taking a pinhole and poking holes in
a hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some inter kind of turbulence
that occurs that does help it allow it to
[SPEAKER_00]: run for very long distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we're looking at installing our
drip tape and we're kind of installing it
[SPEAKER_00]: to the main line, we want to have a punch
to be able to allow those fittings,
[SPEAKER_00]: those barbed fittings to go into that main
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many options that can accomplish
essentially the same task.
[SPEAKER_00]: However pictured here, right here is
what's called the miracle punch and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: highly recommended because it allows for a
minimum fatigue and consistent results if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're making five holes or if you're
making 5,000 holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used this myself and I really think
it is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save it, it'll last for many years and
does make the process much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's hold down stakes and while
technically these may not be needed if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a long run of drip tape that's not
under a plastic cover or another method of
[SPEAKER_00]: support, using hold down stakes is advised
because if you get a high wind,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially early in the season,
all your drip tapes that were originally
[SPEAKER_00]: nicely spaced out go through and start to
overlap and may start to twine and
[SPEAKER_00]: intermix with one another which just
causes a whole mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for features such as galvanized
fittings, these hold down stakes I should
[SPEAKER_00]: say that are six inches long and U-shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: The U-shaped are wind stakes and they're
stronger than just a traditional candy
[SPEAKER_00]: cane J-hook as they hold down especially
well in heavier soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're typically offered in packs of 10
or 100 and you can always get a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: more there and put them all on a line to
make them easier to recover at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additional items that you may need or you
could use I guess I should say would be
[SPEAKER_00]: timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are optional, we see a bunch listed
here, but they're highly recommended
[SPEAKER_00]: especially for larger operations to offer
consistency of the plants because this can
[SPEAKER_00]: allow growers to make better decisions
about making irrigation adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also many of these may be able to hooked
up to rain sensors so plants aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: getting overly irrigated with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basics how to set up here,
these systems can differ, yours may
[SPEAKER_00]: differ, but the basics are still the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can come down to the source a grower
uses and what they want the end result to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply have that initial water,
you have a timer potentially, can have a
[SPEAKER_00]: backflow preventer, want to have a filter
or pressure reducer as well, fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: injector is optional but recommended again
and then this connection to the header
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the main line there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of just that basic kind of
simplified system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be kind of hesitant to adopt a drip
irrigation system because there's new
[SPEAKER_00]: fittings, there's different components
that are needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this breaks it down,
doesn't make it quite as intimidating and
[SPEAKER_00]: allows you to adopt this method for your
own irrigation setup because your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: will like it and you will like it once you
get it all set up because it's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient method and offers great
consistency for you and the plants.
