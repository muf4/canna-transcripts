[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to talk to you about a mist
blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the actual one that I use in
my operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I was a little bit hesitant to
purchase originally, now that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased it, I can see a lot of uses and
it has saved me a lot of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: labor, and money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a mist blower can allow for efficient
nutrient applications as it produces small
[SPEAKER_00]: droplets or mist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at our water droplets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces this fine little mist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a leaf blower that dribbles
some water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns what would be large droplets
into these fine mist droplets,
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing for very efficient coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This blower saves time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quick coverage, provides better
coverage than the traditional pump
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets the tops and bottoms of the leaves
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see this grower application with a
different name brand here, but serves the
[SPEAKER_00]: same purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Efficient coverage of top and bottom sides
of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this blower allows you to use less
product, so it offers a cost savings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed this with the one that I have
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine is paid for itself, just in product
savings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to mention the time and labor savings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're applying any sort of
products, if I was using a regular pump
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayer, I was using a lot more volume for
more time and less efficient coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This now allows more efficient coverage
and less time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while they are can be expensive for an
initial investment, mine is paid for
[SPEAKER_00]: itself now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This blower can also help with the lobster
armor that one big arm as you're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: going through and kind of pumping up that
sprayer the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gas powered sprayer takes care of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This blower downfall is that it can be
heavy, but there are now two different
[SPEAKER_00]: sizes, at least by steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the four gallon, which is 28
pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also make a small two gallon,
which only weighs 17 pounds with their
[SPEAKER_00]: weed whacker motor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sprayed water with the two gallon one
with a grower friend of mine, and it does
[SPEAKER_00]: just as good a job as the four gallon one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only downfalls, you have to fill it up a
little bit more often, but considering the
[SPEAKER_00]: weight savings, and this is of course
without water in it, considering the
[SPEAKER_00]: weight savings, that can be a great option
for someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timing is everything, so take advantage of
a weather window for an ideal spray day
[SPEAKER_00]: may not match your schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes it's a matter of,
oh, I don't have enough time to spray
[SPEAKER_00]: today, but if only it was quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having this method of application that's
efficient can help increase the odds that
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets done, and that's part of what the
misblower has allowed me, is quick catch a
[SPEAKER_00]: weather window, go ahead and apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get efficient coverage, use less
product, use it in less time, rinse it
[SPEAKER_00]: out, and you're good to go for the next
day.
