[SPEAKER_00]: You may have your favorite type of pen,
but here we're going to look at some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the basic different types of construction
of different pens, such as ballpoint,
[SPEAKER_00]: fountain, felt, and ceramic, to name a
few.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the ballpoint pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It dispenses oil-based ink and internal
reservoir through the rolling action of a
[SPEAKER_00]: metal ball, and that's where it gets its
name from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see kind of zoomed-in versions
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That small little ball rolls, and that
causes the ink.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ball may be made of brass,
steel, or tungsten carbonite.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diameter can be classified as fine,
medium, or needle-point, often is the
[SPEAKER_00]: case.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's referring to the precision of that
ball there for a ballpoint pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're typically not made in China due to
the need to have very strict tolerances to
[SPEAKER_00]: the components, which China tends not to
have that high degree of tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why these tend not to be made
in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have our roller pens, and these
are similar mechanics to a ballpoint pen,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they use water-based liquid or gelled
ink.
[SPEAKER_00]: As opposed to the oil-based viscosity ink
found in ballpoint pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're less viscous ink and tend to
saturate more deeply and more widely into
[SPEAKER_00]: paper than other types of ink,
and the writing point is a tiny ball,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually 0.5 or 0.7 millimeters in
diameter, that transfers the ink from the
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir to the paper as the pen moves,
as it rolls across the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have gel pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This ink pigment is suspended in a
water-based gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ink is thick and opaque.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that kind of
differentiates it from the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people really like it, and some
people don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shows it more clearly on dark or slick
surfaces than typical inks used for the
[SPEAKER_00]: ballpoint or even felt-tipped pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those gel pens are popularly increased,
leading to them being used to sign many
[SPEAKER_00]: legal documents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is important to kind of be advised
for what they look like and what
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics they may have,
because we may be seeing them more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is increased number of suspected and
fraud cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, definitely a worthy note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just a gel pen is no longer just kind
of a fun pen that a couple people use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being used at higher levels as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several well-established methods exist for
analyzing inks from ballpoint fountain
[SPEAKER_00]: pens, but not note so much for the gel
pens, which is important when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at them being used in a potential
crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our fountain pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a nimble pen that contains an
internal reservoir of water-based liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike the predecessors that had to dip a
pen, this pen draws ink from the reservoir
[SPEAKER_00]: through the feed to the nib that deposits
on the paper via combination of gravity
[SPEAKER_00]: and capillary action.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no longer do you have the feather you
have to dip into the fountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has an internal kind of reservoir
there, but kind of a unique mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: system for delivering that ink.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our felt-tipped pen, just as the
name implies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a tip that is felt-based,
and you kind of see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really zoomed-in version of some of
the fibers coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tip's common, very porous,
and pressed on fibers such as felt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used until the early 90s, it was the most
common solvents were used in the ink were
[SPEAKER_00]: titilline or xylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, the ink's usually made of bases of
alcohols, propanol, butanol, and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So important if you're looking at
analyzing the ink to be looking at more
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol-based, if you think it was
originated from a felt-tipped pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, we have ceramic pens,
and these wear well due to the ceramic
[SPEAKER_00]: material it's a very hard, very dense
material, and does not broaden when
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure is applied while writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important when you're looking at
analyzing the handwriting if it was made
[SPEAKER_00]: from a ceramic tip pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
I'll see you next time.
