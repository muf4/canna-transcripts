[SPEAKER_00]: On this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to cover cannabis virology and
[SPEAKER_00]: investigation of the past and also the
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now virology is not unique to cannabis,
but we're going to dive into some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: specifics for cannabis and viruses that
infect this particular plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the cannabis
virology investigation of the past and
[SPEAKER_00]: present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, there's this great article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to provide you the link here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a guide to cannabis virology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take some excerpts from this
and show you and break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want the full review of the
full article, link in citation is provided
[SPEAKER_00]: right here for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start off with just the basics,
viral taxonomy basics, how we go about the
[SPEAKER_00]: naming of viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, virus names may be recognized and
are based on actually the plant species it
[SPEAKER_00]: was first detected in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, keep in mind that this does not mean
that is the only plant that the virus can
[SPEAKER_00]: affect.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think that they are
tobacco mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think it only affects tobacco,
not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't even mean it's the most
virulent in that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just simply means that's where it was
discovered first.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this does allow for a relatively easy
system of identification and
[SPEAKER_00]: classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now realize that there are DNA viruses and
there also are RNA viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually single-stranded and
double-stranded DNA and RNA viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's different morphologies to the
structures as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at these kind of taxonomy,
just in general, we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Discovering a virus and naming it may seem
like a standard process, but it is
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing in complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the reason why is it's important due
to the exponentially increasing number of
[SPEAKER_00]: new viruses discovered by next generation
sequencing methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's causing us to kind of
re-look at some old virus names or
[SPEAKER_00]: re-evaluate how we've classified what
viruses might be similar to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: With these new methods, discovery that
when applied to some previously discovered
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses can may lead to a change in
classification, which of course can add to
[SPEAKER_00]: confusion if you knew it by one name or
one classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could go about in change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not only for plant viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for all these small molecules and
organisms that we're looking at and
[SPEAKER_00]: discovering as we learn more about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're figuring out, well, maybe we should
classify them in this category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just got to keep up with the latest
and keep up with the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now report virus and virus in cannabis
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of the great ways of
classifying the family, the genus,
[SPEAKER_00]: the virus, the genome organization,
and who reported it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want kind of what these numbers
refer to for references, you'll have to go
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the source article.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a list of known concerns for
cannabis growers when it comes to viruses
[SPEAKER_00]: and viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It acts as a very great way of quickly
being able to go through and see if you
[SPEAKER_00]: identify a virus, should you be of
concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be still concerned with the
genome organization, but the genus,
[SPEAKER_00]: the virus, you could see potato virus,
alfalfa mosaic virus, grape line pattern,
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco streak virus, and their respective
abbreviations as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see quite a bit listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are distinct visual diagnosis
when it comes to a virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have some very unique leaf
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are a set of visual symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often on the leaves, you'll see them with
modeling, a mosaic, or wrinkling.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably an indication that plant
has a viral infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you do want to take it to the lab
to screen for and identify the exact type
[SPEAKER_00]: of virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why is knowing the virus important?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to say, well, if there's
nothing really I can do as a grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: why would I bother getting it tested?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, justification to go through the
hassle of getting a virus identified is
[SPEAKER_00]: important to know how it may have gotten
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, was it insect vectored?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it, it can reside in the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of, what are you dealing with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because knowing that residual may be what,
and also what the odds of it might be
[SPEAKER_00]: transmitted in the seeds, are all good
information to know as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they make these little quick little
strips called immunostrips taken to labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can really quickly identify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you may think you have one
virus, but you may actually have two
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses infecting the plant
simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is it knowing the virus important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it allows the grower to provide a
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you may have, how can you better
develop a plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you develop a plan of this
prevention going forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to target?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be insect vectors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be soil borne?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be nematodes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be screening plant material
when it comes in?
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows a grower to better provide a
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as a group understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a better understanding of viral vectors
and the genome of the cannabis plant also
[SPEAKER_00]: has resulted in the identification of
regulatory genes responsible for valuable
[SPEAKER_00]: medical and agronomic physical traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CRISPR Cas9 can be used to target
these genes, editing just like other
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural crops and lead to the
expansion and proliferation of this kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of understanding of the plant and being
able to really target these specific
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are threat levels of concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the authors of the article kind of made
this nice little flow chart here with the
[SPEAKER_00]: virus infection, proof identification,
do you have lab conditions, real
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation conditions, and go on from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, they dealt these levels
A, B, C, and D.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that while there are many
viruses that can affect cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: they also propose this kind of level
classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: A being the highest, then going to B,
C, and D being the lowest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while most of the currently available
information is based on other crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis can still provide a good starting
point for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note the following level descriptions are
direct quotes from the research paper that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to provide you with in this
graphical representation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: categorization of virus infection based on
the level of proof and correlation to
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the highest level.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the ones there should be quote
most concerned about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Level A of the classification includes
viruses detected in the field or
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse conditions toward which an
epidemiological survey is active.
[SPEAKER_00]: These viruses can spread horizontally by
vector or by economic propagation and have
[SPEAKER_00]: been associated with significant yield
losses in cannabis sativa, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: other economically relevant crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as to freak you out, but these are
kind of the ones you want to be most
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see a couple here, hoplite and
vibrate, which I'll be describing or have
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptions in other videos, B,
curly top virus, and the lettuce corosus
[SPEAKER_00]: virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the ones that are classified at
the highest threat level for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going another level lower, we've got
classification B.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the list does get a little bit
longer, and this does include viruses
[SPEAKER_00]: which no recent reports of natural
infection in open field or greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are available, but whose ability to
infect cannabis sativa and induce symptoms
[SPEAKER_00]: has been proven through experimental
inoculations and protected environments in
[SPEAKER_00]: the table two provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these viruses are known to possess
a vector and other well studied and
[SPEAKER_00]: characterized crops, but these vectors
have yet to be identified in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa cultivation context.
[SPEAKER_00]: And C, keep in mind, as I mentioned in
other videos, that when the virus name
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't necessarily correlate with
cannabis, you have a raspberry ring spot
[SPEAKER_00]: virus, cucumber mosaic virus, potato
viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember those are where they were the
plant they were first identified in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Threat level C, so we're getting a little
lower here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Members of this level of viruses detected
in symptomatic cannabis plants from fields
[SPEAKER_00]: or greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, none of these have been inferred
as virulence determinants, so to date is
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible to define them as pathogenic or
even asymptomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are a little bit lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that threat level, still something,
if you're seeing something not looking
[SPEAKER_00]: right, you see one of these get screened
for, threat level letter C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, the lowest level or
threat level D, viruses detected both in
[SPEAKER_00]: symptomatic and asymptomatic cannabis
sativa characterizes the level.
[SPEAKER_00]: No correlation has been established
between viral infections and symptom
[SPEAKER_00]: development, whereas persistent infection
and wide distribution are the main
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics of these viral agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So according to this criteria,
threat level D viruses should not be
[SPEAKER_00]: considered a threat to chemist sativa
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're gonna get a virus,
hopefully you get quote one of these,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you are gonna get a virus, this is the
lowest level and really aren't considered
[SPEAKER_00]: a threat to cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of grower friendly system
that they came up with, this threat level
[SPEAKER_00]: classification makes it easier for
cultivators to know if they get a virus
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's identified, what their level of
concern should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also is it possible to prevent it from
occurring in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good information to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intention is to provide the key need
to know information to the cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: without the complexities of virology as
that simple classification system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you do have a plant you think
it's infected with a virus, get it
[SPEAKER_00]: screened, get it identified and then see
what level it matches up with and that
[SPEAKER_00]: should match your level of concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
