[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I investigate some of the
components of growing media.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular here, we're going to look at
the inorganic components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ever looked at growing media,
some contain mixtures of perlite,
[SPEAKER_00]: vermiculite, pumice, sand, and wetting
agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at each of these in a
little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with perlite, it looks like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of little white particles that
are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you a size orientation compared
to a penny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And perlite is sand that's expanded by
heat and has the ability to hold water and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients while also aerating the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll float in water, so it may rise to
the surface of the container, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: when you first go to irrigate something.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you irrigate with a lot of water to
kind of moisten the soil, or a soilless
[SPEAKER_00]: media I should say, these white particles
might float to the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the perlite floating to the
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main goal is to increase the drainage
of the growing media.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in different sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking at mixing your own,
there's fine, medium, and coarse.
[SPEAKER_00]: With coarse being the most common,
and this is typically implemented in
[SPEAKER_00]: growing medium, not so much propagation
medium, especially for the coarse or
[SPEAKER_00]: larger particle size.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also something called vermiculite,
and it looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mica that has been expanded by heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It offers many of the same benefits as
perlite, such as holding water in air
[SPEAKER_00]: while also improving the drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it can hold more water than
perlite, and is more commonly seen in
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting and propagation mixes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same grading system,
fine, medium, and coarse, with fine being
[SPEAKER_00]: used for the propagation, and coarse being
used more for the main growing situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's favored in that cutting and
propagation kind of area, simply because
[SPEAKER_00]: it holds more water, and moisture
retention is a major concern when dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with the propagation environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pumice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very light and porous volcanic
rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's formed when gas-rich frothy of glass
lava solidifies rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of that expanded volcanic
rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, this is very porous,
and it'll actually float in water even
[SPEAKER_00]: though it is a rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very light, something you may have
seen in, for example, if you use grills,
[SPEAKER_00]: pumice can be involved with that due to
its rock-like structure, but extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: lightweight, simply because of the amount
of porosity or air pockets that it has in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also have sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exact composition of sand varies,
but it is made from rock and minerals that
[SPEAKER_00]: are finer than gravel, but coarser than
silt if you're looking at a gradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sand can be incorporated, again,
to help aerate soil, to help create
[SPEAKER_00]: separation of particles, and while its
composition may be slightly varied,
[SPEAKER_00]: the purpose there is still the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also have the last inorganic compound here
is wetting agents, and these are very
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lower the surface tension of a
liquid, allowing it to spread out,
[SPEAKER_00]: creating a water film.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have no wetting agents,
we have this large water droplet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding wetting agents can cause that kind
of to form a sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the different comparisons here,
A, B, C, and S.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wetting of different fluids.
[SPEAKER_00]: A shows fluid with very little wetting,
while C shows a fluid with more wetting.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that greater contact surface here.
[SPEAKER_00]: C has a small contact angle, and that's
allowing it to spread out, and S is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of showing that ultimate sheet there.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the downfall of wetting agents is
there is a lifespan which varies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's typically around three to six months
for long-term wetting agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why getting new soilless media is
advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the wetting agents can degrade
over time, or if you're reusing media,
[SPEAKER_00]: while it may work out good initially,
those wetting agents may not be as
[SPEAKER_00]: effective the second round or second time
that you use that soilless media.
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
