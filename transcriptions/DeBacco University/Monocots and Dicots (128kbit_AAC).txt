[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to go over the difference
between monocots and dicots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pictured here, I have a representation of
each of these two categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monocots are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like grasses or small corn
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dicots here is represented by the bean
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, what monocot and dicot is
referring to, or short for, I should say,
[SPEAKER_00]: is cotyledons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So monocotyledons or dicotyledons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cotyledons is translated into meaning
seed leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in angiosperms, the endosperm is fully
used by the time the seed is mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food reserves are stored by the embryo in
swollen, fleshy leaves called these
[SPEAKER_00]: cotyledons or seed leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dicots have two cotyledons.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example of this would be squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the seedling I have
represented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over here, I have monocots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these have one cotyledon.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are corn plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come up with that one single blade,
where dicots have basically two seed
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves when they emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's many differences between the
monos and dicots, more than just their
[SPEAKER_00]: seed leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's differences in the number of seed
leaves, as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also differences within those
leaves of the way that the veins are
[SPEAKER_00]: organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: For monocots, you're looking at parallel
veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dicots are looking at broadleaf,
network of veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vascular bundles are more scattered in
monocots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's more of a distinctive ring in
dicots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flower parts are in multiples of
three for monocots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And multiples of five or sometimes four in
monocots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the root system is very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: In monocots, it's more fibrous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in dicots, it's more of a tap root
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'll have some of these same
comparisons throughout this presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to try to learn the differences or
distinguishing factors between these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's another representative image.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the monocots here, the dicots
here, showing the leaf venation,
[SPEAKER_00]: the number of multiples in their flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root type, when we look at the
microscopic images, we're looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: scattered vascular bundles in monocots,
a little more organized in a ring
[SPEAKER_00]: structure for dicots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, one seed leaf versus two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring in some of the real world images.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see again how those leaves may
look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dicots can be much more varied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shows you the microscopic image of the
scattered vascular bundles indicative of
[SPEAKER_00]: monocots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the distinctive rings that are evident
for dicots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the floral parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be four or five multiples for
dicots, or typically three monocots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stem that I was talking about,
the kind of organized in a ring here is
[SPEAKER_00]: the dicot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I mean by scattered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see, yeah, there might be a little
bit more concentration to the perimeter
[SPEAKER_00]: here, but overall relatively scattered
throughout the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring that to a real world root comparison
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dicots here of this kind of central
key portion, kind of almost looks like a T
[SPEAKER_00]: or an X.
[SPEAKER_00]: And monocots have this kind of internal
ring structure to their root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, the monocots can be more
fibrous, and the dicots can be more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: central tap root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring that to the larger scale,
which we might be more familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a dicot stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say root system here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of that one central tap
root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dandelions are a prime example of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever tried to pull roots up from
a grass species, or pull it up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: grass in the lawn?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice it's a much more fibrous
root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot more intertwined here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Above ground, the monocots look like those
single blades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those dicots have that kind of broad
leaf appearance here in the different
[SPEAKER_00]: vanations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, dandelions are an example of a
dicot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And grass species are examples of
monocots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zooming in a little bit more, comparing
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there'll be other videos to help
explain a little bit more about the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monocots, that parallel vanation,
you can see dicots a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: complex network of veins in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the same image here,
but bringing in now the seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can see, the monocots are that
single kind of blade that comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dicots are those two seed leaves that
emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could be a pea plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be, like I said, a squash
plant, watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many, many different things fall into
these categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an interesting concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever seen this, around it for a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just what we learned about here with
monocots and dicots, without getting into
[SPEAKER_00]: the specifics of the chemistry that works
in this particular brand of herbicide,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is targeting the dicots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says, kill the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the weed species, such as
dandelions, in this case, clover is viewed
[SPEAKER_00]: as a weed, as an example of dicots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this chemistry is working on something
specific to dicots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it says not in the lawn,
the lawn is a monocot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain chemistries, certain plant
behaviors are not gonna be evident in
[SPEAKER_00]: monocots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this particular chemical will only
attack dicots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how you can apply this to the
lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll kill the weeds, but not the lawn.
Thank you.
