[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here we'll look at what a soil
test tells you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get the results back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bunch of numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the point of taking it?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen really closely, though,
while some people may have to listen and
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's only whispering to you,
others can look at a soil test and hear a
[SPEAKER_00]: megaphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that soil tests can give
you a lot of good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go through some of that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we're looking at what's it
screened for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is looking at a general soil
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at typical nutrients,
calcium, magnesium, phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also something into iron, manganese,
copper, zinc, aluminum, and boron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil pH is also a great item to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can screen for typically total lead,
which is more addressing the potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: soil contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also for some appropriate mineral soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at mainly field-based
soils here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some very common standard
nutrient tests that most labs will test
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the report tells you is an estimation
of plant-available nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an important concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the total amount of the element
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's estimating the plant-available
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is the nutrient numbers provide
an idea of what the roots have access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this comes back to this chart here,
where we can see how pH can vastly impact
[SPEAKER_00]: the availability of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil test attempts to estimate within
a close degree of tolerance of what that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant can pull out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just for example, we're looking at
potassium, and we get a very acidic pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: pH below five.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the availability is much
reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that could mean that there's a lot
of potassium in the soil, but it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: very plant-available, so it will test low
on your nutrient analysis for your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: report.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other test screen for, for example,
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be added to a lot of standard
nutrient tests and determined what's
[SPEAKER_00]: called by a loss ignition test.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means the sample is dried,
then the lab will weigh it, they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: literally burn it, and then they'll
re-weigh it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concept here is that the organic
matter is burned off, leaving only mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: ash left.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount that's lost is the organic
content, and that's expressed as a
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just gives you a little background
on how organic matter is typically,
[SPEAKER_00]: the procedure is typically done for that
number you see on the soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most growers will want high organic
matter, and it really depends on what your
[SPEAKER_00]: native or starting level is.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many garden soils, six to nine percent
is the typical range, but I've seen 20
[SPEAKER_00]: percent or greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this tends to lead to excessive
nutrients, increased disease pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: high water holding capacity, and this can
cause an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more is not always better for organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're at the six to nine range and
you've modified that, that's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty good right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've even seen lower organic matter
percentages performing at a high level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall in the country, the soil organic
matter, the higher ranges are the darker
[SPEAKER_00]: colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see overall soils tend to be a
little bit higher organic matter in this
[SPEAKER_00]: region and a little bit lower organic
matter in the southwest region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just kind of gives you that kind of
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just in general in the country where
higher native or natural soil organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter is present.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this shows is a percent change of
percent acres of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a 30 year percent change in soil
organic carbon in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So carbon is kind of one of the key
measures of organic matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 30 year change compared to soil
organic carbon in one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically what we see in the reds is where
we're seeing a loss, in the greens is
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're seeing a gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, not everywhere has data of crop land
reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see there are areas that are
depleting organic matter at what can be
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes considered an alarming rate,
especially when we're looking at depending
[SPEAKER_00]: more and more on smaller land parcels for
agriculturally produced crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else a soil report may give you
or may have the option to include is
[SPEAKER_00]: something called soluble salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: These salts typically only come back
elevated if salts have been added to the
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And salts can be include chemical
fertilizer, compost, or even areas where
[SPEAKER_00]: snowmelt may be applied in winter months.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good idea to test at the beginning
with proper management, future testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This test may not be necessary,
meaning you don't always have to include
[SPEAKER_00]: this with every test.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're starting with an area,
it's a good one to include on the testing
[SPEAKER_00]: list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen is a little bit of a weird one.
[SPEAKER_00]: These values are only as good as your
sample, meaning it's a volatile nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's constantly changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to get results that are
field-representative, certain steps should
[SPEAKER_00]: be taken during the sampling process to
ensure accuracy, which is analyzed by the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, this is performed during the
month of June, especially for corn
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a June nitrate test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this nitrogen is always changing,
if you test early in the season when soils
[SPEAKER_00]: are cold, you'll get an artificially low
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this PSNT or presidrate nitrate test
taken in June might take off full one foot
[SPEAKER_00]: core.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's corn, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going right through and sampling here
and here, right along the row in kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: zigzag form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And taking those six to nine samples or
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be attentive when taking soil
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is true for any type of sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can kind of see in this image here,
this is a large corn field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of shows what I'm trying to
get across.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the coloration in the
foreground here, nice and green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the coloration here by the homestead,
also green.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look kind of in this area in
the middle, you'll see it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter yellow here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this might be an area you want to
sample differently or separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be caused potentially because
of low nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a water or drainage issue
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a soil profile issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be all the above.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to sample this differently so
we can see if the problem is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients of this particular section of
this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, there's something called particle
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an expensive test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often not cost-justifiable for most
growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically an assessment of the
particle size.
[SPEAKER_00]: particle size of your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This test is of greater importance for
golf courses, especially putting greens,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to maintain those nice,
even conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for most growers, I can't really
recommend the added cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really can't modify for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you some background,
that it is possible to get the particle
[SPEAKER_00]: size evaluation of your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
