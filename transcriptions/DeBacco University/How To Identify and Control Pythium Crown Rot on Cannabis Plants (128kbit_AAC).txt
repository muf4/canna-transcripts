[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
we're going to be looking at how to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify and control Pythium or Crown Rot
in cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see here it can affect them at
the early stages and later in stages,
[SPEAKER_00]: so one to be mindful of as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because Pythium can affect plants at
early stages and later stages,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's important to be able to identify this
and also to have a control idea because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's something growers should be scouting
for through all stages of the plant cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, identification is important
and there are several different pathogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: species that can cause disease in a wide
host range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pythium is a water mold so it can travel
to new host plants via water and that can
[SPEAKER_00]: be irrigation water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root rots and lower stem decay cause
above-ground symptoms such as marginal
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf scorch, stunting, poor plant vigor,
and or inconsistent stands if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking down a long row.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also produce osporous that can
overwinter which can be an issue if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at planting in that same field the
following year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most notably causes root rots that can be
field identified by pulling out the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: and then trying to strip the outer layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is your kind of your root area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take your roots and try to strip off
that outer layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it comes off really easy, that can be a
sign you may have Pythium.
[SPEAKER_00]: The above-ground seedlings can damp off
which is a common propagation areas and
[SPEAKER_00]: larger plants will express chlorosis of
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once Pythium affects hemp plants,
there's really no cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to identify and know that
you have it is important for making ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: and plans for following years as far as
probably not planting in that field or
[SPEAKER_00]: rotating out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the general life cycle of
Pythium?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can see here it is root-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can cause that kind of infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that zoospores, ospores as I said,
swimming kind of in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoospores, germination, attaches to the
root, infects that portion, grows up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, causes a blighted plant,
causes a dead plant, when that plant dies
[SPEAKER_00]: all those roots and have all those
additional spores or oangium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilization occurs causing it to spread,
to directly germinate, to infect more and
[SPEAKER_00]: really can cause this to spread quite
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some common methods of
spreading as it does a pretty good job of
[SPEAKER_00]: it on its own?
[SPEAKER_00]: But soil substrate transfer such as tools,
containers or even shoes can transfer
[SPEAKER_00]: Pythium from one field to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contaminated water, contaminated
irrigation water or runoff can also cause
[SPEAKER_00]: it to spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Infected plants should be isolated,
removed, tagged and bagged to prevent any
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of spread to healthy neighboring
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's winter over inoculum present
from previously infected plants and also
[SPEAKER_00]: poor sanitation protocols particularly if
you're in an indoor growing operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you go about managing Pythium or
crown rot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we want to manage soil moisture in
the root zone, inspect any new plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material entering the growing area for
disease as well as insects, ensure proper
[SPEAKER_00]: aeration of the substrate, keep nitrogen
optimum but not excessive levels and you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to avoid salt accumulation within the
substrate that'll cause plant stress as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have sanitation protocols in place even if
this is not identified, if you think your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are clean, hopefully they are
that's great, still implement those
[SPEAKER_00]: sanitation protocols so that if there's
any small portion of Pythium that tries to
[SPEAKER_00]: get started, your sanitation protocols
should take care of that to eliminate the
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of you seeing that in your
subsequent crop particularly in those
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
