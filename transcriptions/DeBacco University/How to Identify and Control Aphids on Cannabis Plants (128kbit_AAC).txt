[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
we're going to go over how to identify and
[SPEAKER_00]: control aphids, as well as the end,
you'll get to see some actual video
[SPEAKER_00]: footage where I was able to sadly find
some aphids on some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to see actually how they look on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into how to identify
and control aphids on cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see in the image here,
the plethora of aphids sadly on the
[SPEAKER_00]: underside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will be very small, some larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these though, piercing, sucking
insects can do severe damage to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants as well as could also transmit
diseases such as viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aphids, what's the general description
of aphids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, most of the time aphids are
wingless, but in the spring and fall,
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids can have wings to increase their
dispersals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can kind of spread and jump from one
plant to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are small insects that can be found
in large numbers and can also be found in
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might go through an area where you
don't find any, don't find any,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you get like a little hotspot,
at least in the initial point of
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the wingless form of the aphids
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be green to whiter, to kind of
like a brownish, tannish kind of color,
[SPEAKER_00]: to a little black stripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some variants that does
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the eggs of cannabis aphids late
in late September.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here that kind of everything
from that green to that kind of almost
[SPEAKER_00]: see-through green to that dark coloration
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some variables there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that normally females are
present, which gives a live birth to
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically identical daughters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like they're kind of like
giving birth to the genetically identical
[SPEAKER_00]: so they can be literally born pregnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a weird feature to aphids and part
of the reason why they can mass multiply
[SPEAKER_00]: so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the identification of aphids on
cannabis plants is that they can produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: honeydew or a sugary secretion which often
turns black with the growth of a kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: city mold fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some aphid species inject a toxin into the
plants which causes leaves to curl and
[SPEAKER_00]: further distorts growth as well as can
transmit viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see just here a mixture of the
winged and wingless cannabis aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the wingless aphids are in the
immature stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here we have these little white dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are what we call cast skins of
cannabis aphids and these are sheddened
[SPEAKER_00]: aphid molts to a new larger stage and
often collect on the leaves below a
[SPEAKER_00]: colony.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be an indication that aphids are
nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we go about managing aphids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well reflective or silver mulch can be
added to not allow the aphids to easily
[SPEAKER_00]: detect the underside of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of reflective mulch allows it to
kind of like look like the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids get confused and will reduce their
pest pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garlic sprays can help repel them from
initially entering an area as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: utilization of beneficial insects such as
green lace wings and lady beetles can be
[SPEAKER_00]: effective if they are established early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see some aphids and we see the
lady beetle larva feeding on aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we also see the tiny wasp which can
parasitize certain aphids and we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: what it looks like at the kind of mummy
stage there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are kind of ways of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they actually look on a plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I'm going to take you out to an
actual plant and show you just how aphids
[SPEAKER_00]: look on a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here we see some anthocyanins being
produced and that's a coloration to some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the small leaflets near this bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as for comparison, here we're
seeing some of those anthocyanins being
[SPEAKER_00]: produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of purple coloration in this
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times it can be a response to
stress early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be water stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be light stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well kind of the stress going on here is
evident on the underside of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the underside of the leaves
here in particular, sadly we're seeing a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids on that underside of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these aphids are a piercing sucking
insect and they're causing a water stress
[SPEAKER_00]: on the plant and you never really find
just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's usually many of them and we can
see that clearly evident here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something we want to be looking at
controlling early on and scouting for so
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't get into issues like this where
we have a lot of insects kind of reducing
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant performance and ultimately sadly
going to reduce the bud quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think just looking at that bud there
kind of speaks volumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at not really having the
greatest amount of cannabinoids or
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes that are going to be produced
overall yield considering the effort that
[SPEAKER_00]: went into producing a plant of this size.
