[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're looking at memory
challenge or just memory in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important to kind of recognize
your own limitations as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interviewing someone,
there are potential limitations that they
[SPEAKER_00]: may have to recount a scene or remember an
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also remember the duration of time that
event may have occurred or other
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, whether it was during the day
or at night, that can also impact people's
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to remember things or just what
they can see in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at memory, there's different
types of memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sensory memory is one type.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the shortest term element of
memory and its ability to retain
[SPEAKER_00]: impressions of sensory information after
the original stimuli have ended.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's important if you see
something to try to write down as many
[SPEAKER_00]: details as you can as soon after it occurs
as possible so that you're able to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: recount what happened, what occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can add timestamps to it,
that's all the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just kind of this is that first
shortest term element of memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that leads us to working memory,
which has a limited capacity that is
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned with the immediate conscious
perceptual and linguistic processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working memory is important for reasoning
and guidance of decision making and
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can kind of be sometimes
considered to be kind of in the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we looking at making a decision?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you go left?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you go right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you flee?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you stay?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of part of that working memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So limited capacity concerned with that
kind of immediate conscious of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going in and around the individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one I'm going to cover here is
long-term memories that kind of would
[SPEAKER_00]: apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a long-term memory compared to our
short-term memory, which we kind of just
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed previously here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long-term memory, the types of memory
responsible for the storage of information
[SPEAKER_00]: for an extended period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be more limiting on the total
amount of detail that can be provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: But extended period of time, this is
something that if a crime occurred a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time ago, this is kind of what should be
depending on that witness to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide or recount for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tips for improving memory just in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get active and be creative to kind of help
keep the brain working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to teach someone something,
kind of like what I'm doing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test yourself on multiple occasions in
multiple ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be, you know,
just challenging yourself in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Practice and repeat processes and get
enough sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these things kind of can go through
and improve your memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think your memory is,
you know, pretty good as it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you remember anything about the image
on the title slide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hint, there were two children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or can you describe anything about what
was going on in the picture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, for example, can you describe the
shirts that they were wearing?
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, go back to the title slide,
take a look, and keep working on improving
[SPEAKER_00]: your memory.
