[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to specifically look at
the main types of T cells, specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: the four main types of T cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the four main types, we have the first
one here, which is the helper T cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: which initiate the immune response.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the ones that authorize the
attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often helper T cells can be considered
like generals of the immune system because
[SPEAKER_00]: they call up troops of the B cells,
cytotactic T cells, and other helper cells
[SPEAKER_00]: to go into battle against invading
pathogens, as we see in this example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our helper T cells, where are they
located?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones kind of initiating and
calling in other T cells in B cells to
[SPEAKER_00]: initiate this response of the immune
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So helper T cells is one type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another type is called the cytotoxic T
cells, which I mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lyse virus-infected cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the license to kill here,
the kind of secret agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our cytotoxic T cells are the ones that
are actually going through and destroying
[SPEAKER_00]: the cells, lysing those cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here our red blood cell being
lysed, being broken apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're releasing proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of them as like little missiles to
help break down that particular cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third type is called the memory T
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they provide a quick response on
re-exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of the ones keeping watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially we have our initial exposure,
no memory T cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our primary immune response.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's low affinity for antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But upon second exposure, see how it rises
a lot higher and a much quicker
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because of our memory T cells,
because they're providing that quick
[SPEAKER_00]: response upon re-exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're remembering, hey, I've seen this
before, and then initiating much greater
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fourth type are the suppressor T
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these terminate the immune response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this initially might sound
counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we want suppressor T cells?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones that basically declare
victory, and they say it's time to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of the ones that say stop
wasting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop devoting energy to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've cleared up the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can stop now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of that way to kind of regulate or
shut down the system here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, at times we do want these to be
active and cleaning up our body,
[SPEAKER_00]: ridding it of potential invaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also need a way to kind of stop
that so this body's not wasting energy
[SPEAKER_00]: over producing these particular cells,
and the T suppressor cells are responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: for that.
