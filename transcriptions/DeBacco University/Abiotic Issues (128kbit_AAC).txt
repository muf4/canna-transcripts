[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to look at some of the
abiotic issues that impact plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some listed here are like extremes in
temperature, such as cold or heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other stresses can be drought,
salinity, heavy metals, and a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: others that I'm going to discuss here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are abiotic issues impacting
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These aren't to be confused with biotic or
living issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all abiotic is non-living.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these come down to grower error,
but being able to classify plant issues in
[SPEAKER_00]: this category can help with developing a
plan of correction and ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: preventing prevention going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are important things if you can
classify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can help you going forward in
avoiding mistakes in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there are nutrient deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under-fertilizing plants can cause
unwanted stress to the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can stunt their overall growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Individual nutrients have characteristic
looks that can aid in identification of
[SPEAKER_00]: what nutrient the plant is deficient in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because the leaves are yellowing or
the leaves are a certain color,
[SPEAKER_00]: it depends where they might be located,
but that can help with the identification
[SPEAKER_00]: of that nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: To use a grower will know what to properly
feed the plants as far as food goes to
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid that deficiency in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the opposite of that, there's also
nutrient toxicities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often growers will think more is better,
and this is not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to hit the optimum range of
what the plant needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the exact fertilizer blend or ratios
that you're using because it's possible
[SPEAKER_00]: for a nutrient to be over-added if a
grower only focuses on one nutrient of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, fertilizing for nitrogen and
over-adding phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have an example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using this fertilizer for nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're focused on the nitrogen number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, it's nitrogen, phosphorus,
and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're fertilizing for nitrogen,
we could be over-adding the phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be mindful of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just get locked into the one
nutrient you're concerned about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the blend in the entire amount of
fertilizer and all the nutrients that it
[SPEAKER_00]: contains that your plant will be exposed
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have kind of all your ducks in
a row and keep everything nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be getting one way out of
whack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, sunburn or light burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sunburn often happens when plants are
moved from an indoor to an outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also light burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can result when light types are
changed or it can also occur if the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is allowed to grow too close to the
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can cause a burning to the plants,
really damage the leaves, and permanently
[SPEAKER_00]: stuns the most apical varus stems or those
growing tips of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herbicide or spray damage in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: If outdoors and spraying on herbicide to
control weeds in the area, be mindful of
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential for drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small droplet size and wind will increase
the odds of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can kind of see that occurring here
while this particular person is spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: just to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the drift or the carryover.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wind is definitely blowing in this
direction because you don't see a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: spray or drift going this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: For indoor operations, often growers will
mix products too strong or mix some that
[SPEAKER_00]: are incompatible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they can even make applications during
full light intensity of the canopy,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can also cause damage that could
easily be avoided.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this damage is a physical damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's classified as abiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ozone or air pollution is not typically a
major problem, but one that should be
[SPEAKER_00]: taken into consideration if there's an
area of damage that either is sudden,
[SPEAKER_00]: widespread, with other abiotic category
descriptions not fitting what the grower
[SPEAKER_00]: is seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, you kind of get this white or
this bleached look to the light of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be indicated in the potential of
air pollution, air contaminant,
[SPEAKER_00]: or ozone damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can occur in indoor, or more commonly
in outdoor operations in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are using an ozone kind of method
of odor control, be mindful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not functioning properly,
if there's a malfunction, if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's not going right,
that could potentially cause some ozone
[SPEAKER_00]: damage to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
