[SPEAKER_00]: Interested in learning more about HPS or
high pressure sodium lighting with regards
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis production?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've come to the right place here at
Tobacco University where I'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: explaining some of the options with HPS
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into some of the options and
details with HPS lighting for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off we're talking about HPS
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a sodium vapor lamp that is a gas
discharge lamp that uses sodium in excited
[SPEAKER_00]: state to produce a light a characteristic
wavelength near 589 nanometers which has
[SPEAKER_00]: that yellow orange appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are high pressure sodium or HPS bulbs
belong to the high intensity discharge HID
[SPEAKER_00]: lamp family which means that they produce
light in excited gases and vaporizing
[SPEAKER_00]: metals with electrical current to
sufficiently excite them to produce the
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as a note that low pressure sodium
lamps are commonly seen as street lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: they are not the same as these high
pressure sodium lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: High pressure sodium lights are commonly
used as plant grow lights because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: high output that they have an ability to
grow plants when we don't have the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the structure of a high pressure
sodium lamp or the bulb here as we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is a lot of internal
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they can be purchased in 250,
400, 600 or a thousand watt setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all single ended.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also be in double ended
particularly in a thousand watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So realize that there is a lot in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're purchasing these lamps be
sure you inspect them to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing is broken internally in the light
so it's safe and it will actually work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the distance between the high pressure
sodium and the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: High pressure sodium lights do generate
quite a bit of heat so when using higher
[SPEAKER_00]: wattages the distance between the light
and the plants should be overall
[SPEAKER_00]: increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typical distances for high pressure sodium
grow lights can be mounted anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: between 6 and 34 inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six inches is very close and if you have a
dimmable one or a low wattage output one
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe six inches but for the most part
it's better to start further away than
[SPEAKER_00]: closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also when in doubt you want to measure
the light intensity with a par meter to
[SPEAKER_00]: start with a greater distance to reduce it
if there's no burn or damage noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start too close you'll torch
potentially everything so starting further
[SPEAKER_00]: away and bringing it closer can be
advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also need to set up a ventilation
system because these will be generating a
[SPEAKER_00]: fair amount of heat even if you're only
growing with one light to be able to cool
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment that the plants are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned that heat so often when
growing with high pressure sodium lights
[SPEAKER_00]: growers will likely need a way to reduce
the natural heat that this light source
[SPEAKER_00]: produces.
[SPEAKER_00]: A single commercial reflectors are the
most efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will often result in growers
adjusting their growing environment to
[SPEAKER_00]: either increase air circulation or adding
a cooling system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also if some growers grow in
colder climates and they're completely
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors they may choose to run these
lights at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're going to generate heat
anyway and when it's nighttime on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside in the natural environment
temperatures tend to cool so it might be a
[SPEAKER_00]: more advantageous time to generate some
heat to keep the plants warm and also
[SPEAKER_00]: provide them with light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if they're an indoor facility
they're not going to know what the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: light is anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now HPS replacing bulbs and the reflectors
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of growers typically think of
only the bulbs but we also have to keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind the reflectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS grow light should be replaced about
every 5,000 to 10,000 hours of usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light intensity should be checked with
a par meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that the bulbs and also reflectors
degrade over time so for canvas production
[SPEAKER_00]: where light intensity should be maximized
growers will use the 5,000 hour mark to
[SPEAKER_00]: change out their bulbs out and not run
them any longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reflectors you can use a par meter
kind of check that typically every about
[SPEAKER_00]: two years keep them clean and that could
be another thing very easy to replace not
[SPEAKER_00]: that expensive it can help increase the
intensity of light that gets down to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those reflectors commercial all-in-one
units are preferred like the one right
[SPEAKER_00]: next to me over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over build your own options to maximize
production and eliminate potential chance
[SPEAKER_00]: or incompatibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also would not recommend you taking the
old kind of turkey tin here and flipping
[SPEAKER_00]: it over and using that as a reflector and
may look like it does the same thing but
[SPEAKER_00]: from a plant standpoint it's not going to
be nearly as efficient as these commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: options.
[SPEAKER_00]: However even with a quality commercial
setup reflectors should be replaced and
[SPEAKER_00]: growers are advised to purchase
replacements when you're purchasing your
[SPEAKER_00]: light initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: To maximize production reflectors should
be checked replaced about every two to
[SPEAKER_00]: four years to maximize your cannabis
production there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now atrius lights for the entire grow
cycle can you use them from seedling stage
[SPEAKER_00]: to the end flowering stage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it is possible but usually not
recommended to use HPS lighting for the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire grow cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is the case early grow plant will
might stretch more evident might be
[SPEAKER_00]: stretching more evident meaning your
seedlings might be taller than they should
[SPEAKER_00]: be simply because amount of red light is
great for photosynthesis but does induce
[SPEAKER_00]: stretching of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: To reduce stretching growers can select a
bulb that produces high blue light as well
[SPEAKER_00]: or expose plants with some natural
sunlight to fill in some of the missing
[SPEAKER_00]: blue spectrum to help keep those internode
spacing down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now high pressure sodium common wattages
are about 600 and 1000 watts are the
[SPEAKER_00]: common ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: 600 watt grow lights are the most
efficient HPS grow lamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: These grow lights produce more light
output per watt used in other wattages and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're suggested coverage areas of five
by five in a veg room or four by four in a
[SPEAKER_00]: flower room definitely no more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a thousand watt they're the most
powerful and cover the largest area six by
[SPEAKER_00]: six for a bedroom and five by five for a
flower room so deciding on what wattage
[SPEAKER_00]: will also determine the type of bulb you
use and the type of area you can cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's also single ended and double
ended bulbs so over here you can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a single ended and then below me
is the double ended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Single ended bulbs are recommended to be
used with 600 watts in lower wattages.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're easy to replace and use
considerably more at the hobby level.
[SPEAKER_00]: To operate in reduced temperatures so
advised for small grow tent settings
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to your double ended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your double ended are recommended for a
thousand watt bulbs to ensure maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: light intensity and associated with
commercial settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They allow for greater light intensity and
even more even distribution of the light
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the single ended and they can
produce more wavelengths outside the par
[SPEAKER_00]: range including infrared and UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they're typically preferred at
that commercial setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again single ended a little bit easier to
change recommended for the lower wattages
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial setting thousand watts you
should be going with the double ended
[SPEAKER_00]: because that is pretty much considered to
be kind of the industry standard when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to high pressure sodium lights.
