[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBacco University video we'll be
looking at compressed carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles for carbon dioxide enrichment
related to cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see a collection of bottles and
using compressed carbon dioxide bottles
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis production is very common
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are just some examples of some of the
bottles that can be utilized and let's go
[SPEAKER_00]: over some of the process involved when
you're looking at implementing this type
[SPEAKER_00]: of system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off this is the most common for
hobby growers using bottle system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many grow shops have bottle exchange
program which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically this is only for the 20 pound
bottles as these are the most commonly
[SPEAKER_00]: used for grow tents in small operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Realize it can be bottles as small as five
pounds or sometimes even two and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds up to even weigh larger sizes than
just 20 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 can be relatively common easy to handle
they can also be 200 pound bottles it can
[SPEAKER_00]: be very difficult to get at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 by far the most common and often used
in its bottle exchange program.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that is is where you bring an empty
bottle you pick up a full bottle you empty
[SPEAKER_00]: that bottle you bring it back you exchange
that bottle for another full bottle so you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get the same bottles back but you
always have a full 20 pound bottle with
[SPEAKER_00]: this exchange program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the bottle weight keep in mind is only
the weight of the carbon dioxide so just a
[SPEAKER_00]: word of caution if you're purchasing a 20
pound bottle this is only the weight of
[SPEAKER_00]: the carbon dioxide does not include the
bottle weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when purchasing 20 pounds of carbon
dioxide it's likely you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: lifting or transporting closer to 40
pounds and that depends on the material
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottle is made from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lunum's of course going to be lighter than
steel as far as the bottle weight goes but
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're purchasing bottles or looking
at a 20 pound bottle that is only the
[SPEAKER_00]: weight of the carbon dioxide not including
the canister that's included in so keep
[SPEAKER_00]: that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's particularly important when you have
50 pound bottles so these are often more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient way to purchase carbon dioxide
but they can be more of a hassle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember a 50 pound bottle of carbon
dioxide when purchased will weigh about
[SPEAKER_00]: 170 pounds so take care when transporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also just a side note on the image next to
me here while it shows these bottles and
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like they're nice labeled with
carbon dioxide it should be capital C
[SPEAKER_00]: capital O with 2 as a subscript so this
technically looks like cobalt 2 not carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide so that's just a little bit of the
science behind and you want to have
[SPEAKER_00]: capital C capital O with 2 as a subscript
capital C lowercase o actually means
[SPEAKER_00]: cobalt just a side note there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for size reference you know we talk
about these bottles you may look at them
[SPEAKER_00]: online well how big are these bottles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Aluminum carbon dioxide cylinder
information is provided here and shows
[SPEAKER_00]: average height of a person to kind of give
you that idea of just how much bigger that
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 pound bottle is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably part of the reason why the 20
pound is so common 20 compared to 15 even
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to 10 and not all that big of a
size difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want to go much smaller because
you're going to be dosing your area with
[SPEAKER_00]: that so 20 pound bottle probably the most
common for grow shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general though why are bottles so
popular?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're purchasing pure carbon dioxide and
there's no byproduct or waste added to
[SPEAKER_00]: your growing space that's one of the
reasons why compressed carbon dioxide in
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle form is so popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also reduce the chance of plant
damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also controllers with fudgy what's called
fuzzy logic can be used which is another
[SPEAKER_00]: way to help increase use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bottles also do not require special
storage conditions or maintenance
[SPEAKER_00]: basically have an area that's chained off
to a fixed point and you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no not a lot of other special
storage requirements that are needed which
[SPEAKER_00]: makes them very easy to implement into any
particular grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: However bottle danger and storage related
to safety carbon dioxide cylinders should
[SPEAKER_00]: be stored indoors and should be stood
upright against a wall and secured with a
[SPEAKER_00]: chain to ensure they cannot fall over and
potentially damage or rupture the valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can see here with our valves exposed
you also want to try to get bottles and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go back for a second that have these
protective coverings on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the larger 50 pound bottles you
also notice the smaller bottles also have
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only does it protect this from any
sort of damage it can also make for a
[SPEAKER_00]: great area to lift or to carry these
bottles from so it's it's dual
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now back to our kind of bottle danger the
area around the tank is in cylinder should
[SPEAKER_00]: be well ventilated if possible and should
be monitored with a carbon dioxide safety
[SPEAKER_00]: alarm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon dioxide tanks and cylinder should
be stored in areas with a temperature less
[SPEAKER_00]: than 125 degrees Fahrenheit which is 51.7
degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon dioxide tanks and cylinder should
always be connected to a reducing valve or
[SPEAKER_00]: regulator with a pressure safety valve to
prevent any chance of leading to an
[SPEAKER_00]: exploding bottle which is just not a safe
environment for anyone around it and also
[SPEAKER_00]: they can travel quite a distance if that
regular was to break off so it's good to
[SPEAKER_00]: have that carrying handle slash protector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly if you do have a bottle or if you
look at a bottle there are at least
[SPEAKER_00]: certain markings on that bottle so this
kind of gives you just an idea of what
[SPEAKER_00]: those what seems like random numbers kind
of attest to and match and you can take a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture of your bottle match it up here to
get an idea of what those numbers actually
[SPEAKER_00]: mean as far as the safety concerns for
your bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is good information to be aware of that
they're not just random numbers even
[SPEAKER_00]: though they may look like it they actually
can tell you quite a bit of information if
[SPEAKER_00]: you know how to read them and of course
here in Tobacco University providing with
[SPEAKER_00]: the information for something you may have
taken granted of earlier now you can
[SPEAKER_00]: develop that understanding for just what
is on that bottle.
Thank you.
