[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over beneficial insects,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you identify spider mites in your
cannabis production plants and how to go
[SPEAKER_00]: about best controlling them without the
use of insecticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into the video here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you identify spider mites,
you want to control them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This hopefully will provide some help for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, this is all based off of a
research article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look at more than just spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have an idea of the materials,
methods, and more details, I welcome you
[SPEAKER_00]: to check out the reference here with the
link provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, insects can be a challenge
in greenhouse production in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they can cause many losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often synthetic chemicals have been used
as an option, but with the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis kind of cultivation and strict
legalizations and restrictions on the use
[SPEAKER_00]: of those pesticides, most case for a good
reason, this is the driving force between
[SPEAKER_00]: the development of new environmentally
friendly, but yet profitable methods of
[SPEAKER_00]: pest control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this greenhouse study was conducted at
the University, Agricultural University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Athens, they looked at two different
greenhouses, one that had the beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: insects and one that basically did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the mightiest variety they were
using, as well as the general greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions that those plants
and insects were experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now beneficial insects, the general
release date, three weeks after
[SPEAKER_00]: transplantation, beneficial insects were
released into the treatment greenhouse in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to assess the efficiency of the
biological control pest management
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spider mites, this study specifically
looked at spider mites that we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: right here, particularly the two spotted
spider mites is what was studied here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's the information that will be
presented on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throughout the article and presentation
here, probably abbreviated as TSSM,
[SPEAKER_00]: first two spotted spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basic measurements you're looking at
include visual estimations of the
[SPEAKER_00]: infestation, the recording of pest species
and populations, and the comparison of
[SPEAKER_00]: infestations between the two greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the nymphs and adult stages of the
pest were counted, no egg stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this just shows you what some of the
insects look like in comparison,
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites again being this A here,
but you can see some of the other insects
[SPEAKER_00]: for comparison that were part of this
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how were the pest populations
determined?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, measurements of the pests were taken
in the third, fifth, seventh, and ninth
[SPEAKER_00]: week, and the spider mites were counted
with a handheld digital 1600x microscope
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to quantify the efficiency of the
beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Average pest populations were measured in
10 plants, four leaves per plant per
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important on any insect or pest
that you're looking at controlling is to
[SPEAKER_00]: have an understanding of the life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a basic kind of idea of what you're
looking at, the life cycle, as well as key
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I welcome you to pause the video here
if you want to read this in any more
[SPEAKER_00]: detail, but just kind of some highlights
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two spotted spider mites, they're
technically not insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're related to spiders because they
have eight legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can go through five stages in
about two weeks, so they can multiply very
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly and go through this progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adult spider mites can have two color
phases, so keep in mind that you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: just looking for one particular color,
and they all can do varying amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: damage there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, take a pause, read through this
if you want to learn more about spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites, because you want to know the enemy
you're trying to combat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going on to the beneficial insects
specifically to target these spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are the beneficial insects,
and this is Neosilocus californicus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is significantly cooler and warmer
temperatures will slow or inhibit the
[SPEAKER_00]: production of their development,
so keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher humidity is generally necessary
with higher temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the californics can persist in
low humidity environments with limited
[SPEAKER_00]: food sources, which makes it a great
beneficial insect to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: The slower pace that these predatory mites
feed, five mites per day, and their
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to sustain themselves on pollen
that allows them to survive for longer
[SPEAKER_00]: when you have lower pest populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The full life cycle of californicus can
last between one to two weeks and is
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly influenced by temperature,
so keep that in mind if you're in a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse environment what season you
might be considering applying these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have another one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Phelotila, formerly known as a
different name, so again, maybe do some
[SPEAKER_00]: research as far as looking at both names,
that's what it's currently known as.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a pink-brown predatory midge,
and it only gets about two millimeters
[SPEAKER_00]: long, it's about one-twelfth of an inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The antennae of the male insect are
covered with long hairs, with those of the
[SPEAKER_00]: female shorter and thicker, so good if
you're using a magnifying loop,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would be recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female adult lays eggs inside spider
mite colonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larvae begin to prey on the spider
mites immediately after hatching.
[SPEAKER_00]: The young larvae feed mainly on the spider
mite eggs, and older larvae feed on all
[SPEAKER_00]: stages of the mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of get that multiple life
cycle benefit or control.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larvae eat about 50 spider mites
before pupating, and the larvae are
[SPEAKER_00]: creamy, yellowy-brown colorations,
again, between a quarter to two
[SPEAKER_00]: millimeters long.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pupate can be found inside the white
cocoons, along the veins of the leaves if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing inspections, as you should
be, of your particular cannabis leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for that two-spotted spider mite
control, the predators were applied by
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging slow-release sachets, as we can
kind of see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of these contains about 100 predatory
and storage mites of the califogranus per
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other ones here, they are introduced
by making a hole in the lid, located
[SPEAKER_00]: directly in the middle of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be mindful as far as these
beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an insecticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't just mix and apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at different methods of
application to allow the greatest benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: for those beneficial insects to go about
attacking, in this case, your spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at the data from the actual
study here for our two-spotted spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites, plants treated with beneficial
insects saw a dramatic decline in mite
[SPEAKER_00]: populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you the data table,
but the graph really shows it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week three, remember, both greenhouses,
the control, which had no spider mite
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects added, and the
treatment, which would have those added,
[SPEAKER_00]: were initially right around the same
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking here at the progressions,
spider mites definitely increased
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatically, dipped a little bit in the
control, but we can see the treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: group really a great increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: By week nine right here, there was less
than two spider mites per plant on average
[SPEAKER_00]: for those plants treated with the
beneficial insects, compared to over 75 in
[SPEAKER_00]: the control plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this massive decrease and significantly
different decrease as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All great that these beneficial insects
are definitely worth the time and effort
[SPEAKER_00]: they are to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Average number of pest populations here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see those numbers in general,
kind of how they were able to be reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are numbers in weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: A continuous reduction in all pest
populations was observed throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment, approaching zero value per
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did look at other insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have other videos on those,
but this just shows you that spider mite
[SPEAKER_00]: population decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now not mentioned in the study here was
the persimilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these do a little bit better,
I will admit, when there is webbing
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can be a little bit more of a
benefit in that factor if your spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites have developed that protective
webbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do want to try to break that as much
as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: The release of these as the first sign of
mite infestations is advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the leaf damage is serious,
more than four mites per leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: achieving the control is more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind, you want to try to
catch these early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Persimilis is a red in color relative to
the pest mites and they feed on and are
[SPEAKER_00]: best used to combat active mite
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will leave the area in search of
alternate food sources if pest populations
[SPEAKER_00]: drop between a lower level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep that in mind that pest
populations too low or you're just seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: it, this may not be your best option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the other ones mentioned would be
advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now are beneficial insects worth the
effort?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well in short, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The study indicates that beneficial
insects could control pest populations up
[SPEAKER_00]: to 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pest management with natural enemies is
very promising, very effective,
[SPEAKER_00]: safe method for plant protection as well
as applicator protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what growers do need to keep in mind
if you are considering this, which
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully you are, is that proper pest
identification is important since this
[SPEAKER_00]: will determine the exact beneficial insect
you're going to utilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: This requires frequent scouting,
timing and rates of beneficial additions
[SPEAKER_00]: are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember you're dealing with a
biological system, so keeping the right
[SPEAKER_00]: species, the timing and matching the
species with your pest and the degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: severity of the problem is all important
to achieve a very effective
[SPEAKER_00]: environmentally sustainable control
method.
