[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever heard the term rosin related
to cannabis and wondered what it was?
[SPEAKER_00]: This Tobacco University video will help
explain exactly what this is and talk a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about the extraction process it
takes to make rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is rosin from cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's get into that answer right
here on this video lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the description of the method of making
rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the desired materials broken down
into roughly 0.2 to 0.5 gram increments
[SPEAKER_00]: and placed on a rectangular shape inside a
filtering mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see a little bit of that
picture right here and kind of see that
[SPEAKER_00]: process going on up here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Material inside the mesh filter is placed
in between two sheets of parchment paper
[SPEAKER_00]: and a rosin press is preheated to desired
temperature, typically increased up from
[SPEAKER_00]: 250 degrees Fahrenheit or 122 degrees
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exact protocol might depend on the
machine, might depend on exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at extracting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see an example of that
quick version of that process here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we see here setting the
temperature here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, 250 degrees Fahrenheit or
122 degrees Celsius, be aware of the
[SPEAKER_00]: units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the process there, you can kind of see
kind of the end process coming through
[SPEAKER_00]: here is that the mesh of the materials
placed in the preheated rosin press and at
[SPEAKER_00]: a constant pressure is applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you kind of see the press going on
right up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within one to five minutes, the rosin will
have been extracted from the mesh bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And should be followed down the parchment
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pressure is released and the resulting
rosin extract is cooled to allow it to
[SPEAKER_00]: solidify.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of see it here in the liquidy
portion that would then be cooled to then
[SPEAKER_00]: produce that kind of solid portion that
could then be applied to the next given
[SPEAKER_00]: situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the resulting end product, what does
that solid product kind of look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that resulting product of the rosin
press is the rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's solventless extract that can contain
upwards of 80% THC and holds many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: from the original plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of the reason why it is so
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see examples of that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also have like artisan versions of
rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of making art almost with that
rosin end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what are the advantages of rosin?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see some other examples of press
indicated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages of rosin is that the method
is completely solventless, making rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the purest concentrates available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relatively simple and easy process with
minimal specialized equipment required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cost effective when compared with other
extraction methods and rosin presses are
[SPEAKER_00]: not limited just to commercial operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here releasing a hydraulic jack pump that
could be used to pump up a car to change a
[SPEAKER_00]: tire can still be applied here.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages of rosin are
that high pressure rosin presses can be
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely dangerous if they're misused.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also easy to burn the extract if not
properly pressed and after that
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature can be so critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professional grade rosin equipment can
become costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's still much cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: than a standard closed loop system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're talking about rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one other point that I did want to
mention is that the difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: live rosin and live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do not confuse the two end products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosin, which is going to focus here,
is considered to be solventless extract
[SPEAKER_00]: that maintains the chemical profile of the
plant without the risk of potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: hazardous chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resin is a solvent based extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resins usually comes derived from butane,
hash oil is made with live or freshly
[SPEAKER_00]: frozen plant material and processed in a
single pass extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used to capture the plant's terpene
and cannabinoid profile by processing the
[SPEAKER_00]: resin glands before the plant is dried and
cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that while these may look
really quick, the same and there might
[SPEAKER_00]: only be one letter difference,
the end product is very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to understand the
difference between the two and the focus
[SPEAKER_00]: here has been rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not want to leave you out with just
a little description of what resin is and
[SPEAKER_00]: how it's different than the production of
live rosin.
Thank you.
