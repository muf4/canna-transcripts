[SPEAKER_00]: Now cloning is a common practice with
cannabis plants, so we're going to go over
[SPEAKER_00]: if you were to dedicate an entire room to
that, what would it look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see many growers will,
and they can be small operations,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they can be very large operations
depending on the cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to point out initially here,
on both of these instances, you see the
[SPEAKER_00]: labeling, which is important to keep track
of those clones so you know exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: you have and where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the general comparison of cloned rooms
to regular rooms, well this should be the
[SPEAKER_00]: smallest of the rooms, and this is
including or comparing to vegetative and
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering rooms, simply because the plants
will be the smallest, and you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: control humidity and temperature,
so keeping everything small makes it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit easier to go about doing that
than comparison to like a large flower
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cloned rooms for as far as lighting goes,
fluorescent lights are advised that this
[SPEAKER_00]: is reduced power consumption and minimal
heat generated.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, ceramic metal halides are gaining
popularity for the reduced number of bulbs
[SPEAKER_00]: and ease in comparison to fluorescents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically T5 fluorescents have been used,
however I think going forward,
[SPEAKER_00]: ceramic metal halides are going to be
replacing T5 fixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: T5 fixtures with fluorescents require long
bulbs, many bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one light here, one light bulb can
do a large area, very similar to what T5s
[SPEAKER_00]: can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also bulb life is much longer,
you can get into mobile ballast here,
[SPEAKER_00]: so there's a lot of advantages going to
ceramic metal halides over fluorescents
[SPEAKER_00]: and T5 fluorescents in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again that lighting, this is a 600 and 15
watts ceramic metal halide or 1000 watt
[SPEAKER_00]: metal halide can be used to efficiently
cover a large area when propagating large
[SPEAKER_00]: number of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping this light intensity low on plants
so the foliage is not burned can be
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplished by hanging this light a good
distance away, usually at least about five
[SPEAKER_00]: feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get to mobile ballast, that's also
a great option because that allows it to
[SPEAKER_00]: hang at the same height, you just got to
go through and adjust it there,
[SPEAKER_00]: or hang shade netting between the light
and the plants, that can help again reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the chance of burning the tender plants if
you're trying to maintain or use the same
[SPEAKER_00]: lights for multiple purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see scaling up, so a clone room
or a clone tent in this case, and staking
[SPEAKER_00]: up a two by two area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clones that are propagated in this two
by two area can support an eight by eight
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to plant accordingly because
remember in this small propagation,
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are going to be very close
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did this for a little size comparison,
this is a two by two grow tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is only a four foot by two foot
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an eight by eight is a much larger
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you pack this small two by two
structure and you want to make all those
[SPEAKER_00]: clones to make it, you want to be sure
that you also have for at least flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: stage an eight by eight grow tent to help
support all the clones that are produced
[SPEAKER_00]: in that small two by two area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preparing the material, we want to make
sure that mother plant will be providing
[SPEAKER_00]: the clones, it's a healthy plant because
that's critical to the success of the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative process or the propagation
process here, the cloning in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that mother or stock
plant is as healthy as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that clone room, we want to keep the
conditions around 70 to 80 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply hang a thermometer would be great
to help monitor that and make sure you're
[SPEAKER_00]: staying within that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidity 70 to 100%, again, depending how
early in the propagation cloning process,
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% very early and then reducing that
over time to 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those higher amounts early will help
reduce the chance that the leaves are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to burn or things are going to
desiccate out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to prepare for the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: If our clones are going to be going to an
outside environment for that transition,
[SPEAKER_00]: plants should be potted into larger
containers and deeper containers to allow
[SPEAKER_00]: for a larger root development and profile
to be established before going to a very
[SPEAKER_00]: stressful outside environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also should be what's called hardened
off before being placed in the field by
[SPEAKER_00]: exposing them to bright light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we want to work them up to brighter
light before we just throw them outside
[SPEAKER_00]: into the harsh full sun of the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The use of ceramic halides can reduce
hardening off time as transition to the
[SPEAKER_00]: harsh, again, natural sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be mindful what lights
you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go from fluorescence, those are
very subdued lights and great for
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're looking at ultimately going
outside, you might want to use a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: discharge light to reduce the chance those
plants are going to burn when they hit the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The summary here, these clone rooms can be
simple, effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even use grow tents in some
instances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwell can be used as rooting media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidity domes and fluorescent lights are
often easy and effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also add a heat mat here to help
encourage rooting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the humidity dome to maintain
that humidity and a heat mat here to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: those rooting areas a little bit warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key is to transfer clones to more
light and less humidity to ease their
[SPEAKER_00]: transition to the soon-to-be vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how you can create an
environment that's not too humid or too humid.
