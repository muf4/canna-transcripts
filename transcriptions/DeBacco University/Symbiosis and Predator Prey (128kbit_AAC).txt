[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at symbiosis and
predator-prey relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example of symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the bee pollinating this flower
and predator and prey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a bigger fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a barracuda feeding on some sort of
baitfish here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we have something called
co-evolution, it's a term that describes
[SPEAKER_00]: the long-term evolutionary adjustments of
a species to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's two or more species that exert
selective predisposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have pressures on each other and
evolve in response to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our example here, our hummingbird and
our flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hummingbird is a very long beak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower, the nectar, is located very deep
in the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is selecting for this hummingbird
to feed and pollinate this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both of these are adapting to meet the
needs of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because each species is evolving in
response to each other, one important
[SPEAKER_00]: feature of co-evolution is that selective
environment is constantly changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both the coloration here and the depth of
the flower is related to that co-evolution
[SPEAKER_00]: that also the hummingbird is adjusting to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we study co-evolution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, co-evolution is studied in several
different levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have adaptions of the individual to
investigate, interactions between the
[SPEAKER_00]: species, and broad evolutionary patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is different than co-adaptation,
which is referring to adaptations of
[SPEAKER_00]: certain species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much shorter term.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could refer to species adaptation
processes, processed by individuals,
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes, and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll post a link in the description to
this video here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps explain it a little bit more,
too, with hosts and pathogens co-evolving
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's constant competition that's
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Co-adaptation now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have caterpillars that secrete
honeydew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So honeydew is that sticky substance that
ants like to drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sugary substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ants defend the caterpillars against
parasitic wasps.
[SPEAKER_00]: As with the honeydew, secretion and
defense are co-adaptations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that the caterpillar is
producing honeydew that the ants favor or
[SPEAKER_00]: like allows the ants to protect the
caterpillars from getting attacked by
[SPEAKER_00]: these parasitic wasps that literally lay
eggs inside them and cause the
[SPEAKER_00]: caterpillars to be eaten from the inside
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the honeydew that the ants like is
protecting the caterpillars from the
[SPEAKER_00]: wasps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty complex system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does co-adaptation demonstrate
co-evolution?
[SPEAKER_00]: So biologists have a strict definition for
co-evolution in its parallel evolution
[SPEAKER_00]: between taxa as required.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the example here of the hawk,
the bat, and the dragonfly all having
[SPEAKER_00]: developed some form of flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is looking at parallel evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all developing the fact that they
can fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a condition in which two or more
kinds of organisms live together in close
[SPEAKER_00]: associations with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three different types,
which we're going to go into more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mutualism, parasitism, and communalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have our reefs here with our fish
and coral living together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mutualism, both participating species
benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parasitism, one species benefits while the
other is harmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Communalism, one species benefits and the
other is needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither harmed nor has any benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of these in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with mutualism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mutualism is a symbiotic relationship in
which both species benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our ants and our aphids here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids provide the ants with food in the
form of continuous excreted honeydew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're piercing the plant and giving the
ant very easy honeydew access.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ants transport the aphids to protect
them from predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the aphids can be attacked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ants are protecting those aphids
because they're the ones giving them the
[SPEAKER_00]: honeydew, the sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why both are benefiting,
because the ants getting the honeydew and
[SPEAKER_00]: the aphids are getting protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ants defending aphids from lady beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, ladybugs love to eat aphids,
so the ant will actually help protect
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, both species are benefiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mutualism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example here are ants providing
food bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: These kind of large structures here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ants are providing organic nutrients and
protecting these flower regions,
[SPEAKER_00]: or these plant regions, from herbivores
and shading from other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're eliminating competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, the plant's able to do
better, so the plant's benefiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the ants, in this case, they're getting
a benefit also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when both species are benefiting,
again, they're both doing work,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in this case, both are through the
relationship of benefiting from the
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are called mutualism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, in class, you would be working
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both you and your lab partner would be
sharing ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be the example of mutualism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of you are working towards a common
goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of you may be doing slightly
different things, but in the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: both of you are benefiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that with parasitism,
so a parasite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to remember a parasite's
different than a predator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parasitism, symbiotic relationship in the
form of predation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The predator, parasite, is much smaller
than the prey.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prey does not necessarily need to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prime example would be the mosquito.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mosquito basically attaches to your skin,
pierces your skin, takes in the blood from
[SPEAKER_00]: your body, and then leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a parasite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an example here of leeches on a
fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: A parasite.
[SPEAKER_00]: A true predator here we have the lions
consuming their food prey.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually killing it completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, in this case, a predator or parasite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parasitism is much smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, they're about equal size.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prey doesn't necessarily need to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of us, we may not necessarily
die from mosquito bite, assuming we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: carrying any harmful diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leeches do not want to kill their host,
but in some cases, they do, but it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two different types of parasites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have external parasites, such as we
call those ectoparasites, and they feed on
[SPEAKER_00]: the exterior surface of an organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prime example would be a tick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have different types of ticks,
but they all are ectoparasites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're feeding on the surface of your
skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parasitoids are insects or wafts that lay
eggs on living hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hear hornworm meets alien.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our hornworm here feeds on tomatoes,
is getting attacked here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our parasitic wasp attacking an
aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are examples of parasites,
and these are parasitoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: ectoparasites living purely on the surface
of the organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, there's something
called endoparasites, and these live
[SPEAKER_00]: within the bodies of vertebrates and
invertebrates, marked by much more extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: specialization than external parasites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a parasite specifically that can
live inside you in your specific body
[SPEAKER_00]: system, as an example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are endoparasites living within the
bodies, inside, endo meaning in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brood parasites are birds, as an example,
laying eggs in the nests of other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a cowbird and this eastern
phoebe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eastern phoebe eggs are all this nice kind
of light, almost pinkish-tanish color,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we have the cowbird, this
speckled egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens here is the phoebe species
creates a nest, lays its eggs in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this cowbird, this brood parasite,
comes in, lays one egg within the other
[SPEAKER_00]: eggs of this other bird species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This poor phoebe then takes care of all
the eggs, lays in all the young,
[SPEAKER_00]: and is inadvertently taking care of this
other species, this cowbird, this parasite
[SPEAKER_00]: species, that basically didn't build the
nest, doesn't feed the young, comes in,
[SPEAKER_00]: lays the egg, and then leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an example of, again, a parasite.
[SPEAKER_00]: One organism is benefiting, one is clearly
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Communalism is a symbiotic relationship
that benefits one species, but neither
[SPEAKER_00]: harms nor benefits the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clownfish and sea anemones are the prime
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clownfish gain protection by remaining
among the anemone's tentacles,
[SPEAKER_00]: their stinging tentacles to most other
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also glean scraps from the anemone's
food, but the anemone is really not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting much of a benefit in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clownfish is getting a benefit,
but it's not like the clownfish is feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: on the anemone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not reducing its ability to survive
at all, but there's really no benefit for
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other examples would be cattle egrets in
the African Cape buffalo, this species
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The egrets are the birds, and they eat
insects off the buffalo.
[SPEAKER_00]: See them located here, here, this one back
here, a couple here on the hippo.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're eating the insects, but there's no
clear distinction between communalism and
[SPEAKER_00]: mutualism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, communalism is a relationship
that benefits one, but neither harms nor
[SPEAKER_00]: really benefits the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult to determine if the second
partner benefits at all in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed, relationships may sometimes be
parasitic, but in this case, the insects
[SPEAKER_00]: that the egrets are eating are really not
doing any harm to the Cape buffalo here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really not offering a benefit by
removing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Predator-prey interactions, this predation
is the consuming of one organism by
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a clear distinction here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The predator-prey predation is eating the
other animal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have the prey mantis eating the
fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a bird here eating a fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's going to be one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The poor fish isn't going to survive,
and that poor fly is not going to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great blue herring eating a
sunfish in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under simple laboratory conditions,
predation often exterminates the prey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it becomes extinct itself because it
runs out of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: If these great blue herring ate all of the
sunfish, they themselves would become
[SPEAKER_00]: extinct because they'd eliminate their own
food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, this doesn't happen in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: What tends to happen in nature is the
example here we have of our North American
[SPEAKER_00]: snowshoe hare, a rabbit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the lynx that feeds on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prey is the rabbit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice as the rabbit population
increases, there's a slight delay within
[SPEAKER_00]: the lynx population increase, and then
that will drop as the rabbit population
[SPEAKER_00]: drops, and it kind of goes through this
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rabbit's population depends on the
presence of what it eats.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's a willow or birch
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lynx is dependent on the presence of
the actual rabbit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's this transition that's
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: High in one case, followed by peak here in
the predator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prey drops, predator drops, so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This interaction occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This predator-prey interactions occurs
something called keystone species.
[SPEAKER_00]: These interactions are essential for the
maintenance of species diversity in
[SPEAKER_00]: communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The predators can be greatly reduced
competition, competitive exclusion by
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing the individuals of competing
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this look at a real example?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keystone species here, we have feeding on
kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our kelp forest that exists and
anemones here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These sea stars are bivalves and they're
dominating the habitats here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feed on the kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there's only a couple of them,
the kelp is able to grow and is able to
[SPEAKER_00]: eat protective forests and everything's
well and good.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you take out the key species
here, the one that's eating these
[SPEAKER_00]: particular sea stars, now we've got a
plethora of sea stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our kelp basically goes down to almost
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as a result, we don't have this
protective kelp forest to allow fish
[SPEAKER_00]: species to occur, to protect them from
other bigger fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this keystone species is a very
important species that can vastly affect
[SPEAKER_00]: the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keystone, where it gets its name from,
is the keystone in a archway.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stringers are the stones here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The keystone is that center one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example of the keystone species
would be a beaver.
[SPEAKER_00]: They create these beaver dams that can
block up rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know of any people that live near
these ways, beavers are very persistent in
[SPEAKER_00]: putting up these beaver dams that can
really change an ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, these beavers would be a
keystone species because they vastly
[SPEAKER_00]: impact the environment around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at this beaver, I don't know if I
trust him 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looks like he's up to no good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, he's a keystone species and can
vastly affect the environment physically
[SPEAKER_00]: here by building the dam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he may also be able to affect it
intellectually because it looks like he's
[SPEAKER_00]: plotting something.
Thank you.
