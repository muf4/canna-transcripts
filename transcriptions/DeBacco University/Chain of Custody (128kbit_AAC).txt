[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so here on this Tabaka
University video, we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the chain of custody and how
this relates to crime scene and the
[SPEAKER_00]: processing and handling of evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, well, what is the chain of
custody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, chain of custody is a record,
a recorded list of all persons who come in
[SPEAKER_00]: possession of an item of evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal is to maintain a document that
includes exactly what happened to the
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence from the time it was found to the
time it is presented in court.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone that goes to see it, the item that
gets passed on, that chain of custody is
[SPEAKER_00]: that chain that you're able to follow a
paper trail of where that evidence went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the requirements of the chain of
custody here, we want to have the list of
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence, including the item number and a
brief description.
[SPEAKER_00]: This identifies the location the item was
stored, the date and time of all transfers
[SPEAKER_00]: that may have occurred, signature from the
individual releasing the evidence to
[SPEAKER_00]: another individual or location,
the signature of the individual
[SPEAKER_00]: transporting the evidence if it applies,
the signature of the individual receiving
[SPEAKER_00]: the evidence from the other individual or
location and the reason for that transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, there's a lot of
requirements associated here with the
[SPEAKER_00]: chain of custody, but it is a very
important process here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the presentation of the chain of
custody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we're looking here,
the evidence container must have
[SPEAKER_00]: identified markings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The collector's initials should be placed
on the seal as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If evidence is turned over to another
person, the transfer must be recorded as
[SPEAKER_00]: an evidence of transmissional sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is very important that that
documentation is made so that that piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of evidence that was collected can uphold
in the court of law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, what does one of those
transmissional sheets look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's just an example of one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all documents, the chain of
custody for a list of items of evidence
[SPEAKER_00]: that are numbered consecutively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see kind of these examples of these
transmissional sheets here, all the
[SPEAKER_00]: information that's required.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the hard work that went into
acquiring the evidence to begin with and
[SPEAKER_00]: ensures it isn't tampered with in any way,
and it can hold up in the investigation of
[SPEAKER_00]: a crime scene.
