[SPEAKER_00]: So in this video, we're going to look at
what came first, the chicken or the egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm actually going to get to an answer
at the end here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heard this debated many times amongst
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: What came first, the chicken or the egg,
or the egg, or the chicken, or the
[SPEAKER_00]: chicken, or the egg?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get to an answer and
support that with science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, chicken or the egg?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one came first?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to some of the reasons here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at first, great moments in
evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Birds share a common ancestor with sharks
and fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the distant relatives of birds had to
make the jump from the aquatic environment
[SPEAKER_00]: to the terrestrial one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see Gary Larson here, Far Side Comics,
great moments in evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see the fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's the baseball.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to make this jump from
this aquatic environment to this
[SPEAKER_00]: terrestrial one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terrestrial environment has a lot of
challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is the increased amount of
gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in the aquatic environment,
whales can get big and support themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can move easily with the buoyancy of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not so much in the terrestrial
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exposure to UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more UV light exposure on
the terrestrial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, quick changes in temperature occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water acts as a great moderator of
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not so much on land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air temperature can change very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the obvious one, making the jump to
dry land is to reduce access to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That needs to be a final way to kind of
retain and maintain a moist environment
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are we going to make this
transition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, organisms need to maintain this
moist environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If organisms cannot find a way to retain
water, they desiccate and they die,
[SPEAKER_00]: as this poor bird found out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water balloons is the example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Able to retain water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We puncture that thin outer membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's recently punctured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a cool image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that water is going to spill out,
resulting in a desiccation of the animal,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the amniotic egg is the key here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps maintain a watery environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This amniotic egg makes it possible for
organisms to make the jump from the
[SPEAKER_00]: aquatic to a terrestrial environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chicken could not survive initially,
so this primitive egg had to precede the
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The egg needed to be able to create a
separate aquatic environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the amniotic egg does just this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fills in this gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Provides this wet aquatic environment,
allowing the organism to make that jump
[SPEAKER_00]: from the aquatic environment to that
terrestrial one, where access to water is
[SPEAKER_00]: not as easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spoiler alert, the egg came before the
chicken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, the egg had to come before the
chicken because this makes the jump to dry
[SPEAKER_00]: land possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know you may debate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to add your comments below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this does provide some
scientific basis for why the egg came
[SPEAKER_00]: before the chicken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this kind of settles some of
the debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or knowing YouTube comments, it may spark
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comment below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear what you think.
Thank you.
