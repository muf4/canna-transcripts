[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're going to look at growing an
established strain of cannabis versus
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding your own when we're talking about
cannabis genetics and some of the pros and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the cons associated with making
these decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, let's look at if you're
growing an established strain and there
[SPEAKER_00]: are many established strains out there,
many options for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the advantages of
utilizing the options that are available
[SPEAKER_00]: to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, if you're growing a small
number of plants, your options for
[SPEAKER_00]: experience are minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where you're probably going to
favor something that's established.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also great for those that are
starting out growing and want something
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't have to work a lot at and kind
of set of knowns comes with growing an
[SPEAKER_00]: established strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing what to expect as far as height
and flower time, all that can be a great
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage to a grower, particularly
starting out grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also growing the same established strain
allows for growers to refine their skills,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep some sort of constants throughout the
different grows that you made have.
[SPEAKER_00]: These known genetics offer the source of
consistency and allow you to develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: plan of action and allow you to refine
that plan with the same set of genetics or
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some of the disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would you may not want to go
through this route of growing with an
[SPEAKER_00]: established strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: We may not have the characteristics you
desire of what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The end product might be the same as what
you can simply purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you justify the expense of time and
money to go through and develop that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, use that strain when I can
really just go and purchase that maybe at
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced cost overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also reduces your ability to
experiment when you have something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: known, you kind of have that consistency,
which can work to your disadvantage if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at doing some sort of
experimentation, different plant types on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also have the option of creating
your own strain and the exact traits you
[SPEAKER_00]: desire to be bred or created can be an
advantage of going to this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also increase your interest in the
growing process particularly more for the
[SPEAKER_00]: site, more advanced growers that are like,
okay, I've grown the same strain for ever
[SPEAKER_00]: and ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me try to create my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also allows for the potential to create
something unique and different.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see here with maybe colorations
or terpene profiles or cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations allow those to kind of
develop your own, maybe something a little
[SPEAKER_00]: different or unique to the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also have the disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also to consider these when we're
creating our own strain is that it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: very time consuming and there's also no
guarantee of success.
[SPEAKER_00]: To create your own strain also requires
multiple growing locations and isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why it's typically more
reserved for the advanced grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question is, what would you choose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you grow an established strain or
would you select to create your own
[SPEAKER_00]: strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to you to decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, there's pros and cons
to each decision.
