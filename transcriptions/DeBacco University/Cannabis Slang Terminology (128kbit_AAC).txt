[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm going to go over some cannabis
slang terminology.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there are many slang terms out
there, I've chosen just a couple select
[SPEAKER_00]: few to highlight in this video lecture
series.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, probably the most obvious
that most people can connect or relate is
[SPEAKER_00]: the number 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as the story goes, or the story
behind 420, is that in 1971, five high
[SPEAKER_00]: school students in San Rafael,
California, calling themselves the
[SPEAKER_00]: Waldo's, used the term in connection with
a plan to search for an abandoned cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were planning going and searching
for this rumored crop to be in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They designated the Louis Pasteur's statue
at the high school grounds as their
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting place, and 420 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: as their meeting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: After several failed attempts,
they never did find that rumored or
[SPEAKER_00]: abandoned cannabis crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The group evolved 420 into a code word
that the teens used to mean the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the background of 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of where it originated out in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually a group of high school
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hear the term veg used a lot,
the veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, veg is simply abbreviation for
vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's referring to the stage of the plant
development that produces leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: not flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is associated with a light cycle of
16 to 24 hours of continuous light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 16 to 24 hours will keep a plant in
veg, and that will keep the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower is the actual trimmed bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the actual product post-tripping,
as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's referred to as the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's preferred to see the actual portion
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're saying a flower,
I don't think of a beautiful, nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the actual final trimmed product,
which in this case typically does not have
[SPEAKER_00]: any seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hear the term phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers are going phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is searching for a specific
characteristic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This re-pheno is short for phenotype,
so it's phenotype hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What these growers are doing is a
phenotype is an observable physical
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristic of an individual,
which is a result of the interactions of
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic with the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When growing many individuals from across,
there will be some variability,
[SPEAKER_00]: so breeders may want to select the best
individual to continue breeding that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, it will phenohunt,
as it will be looking for a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristic that they may then clone
and use in future breeding work.
[SPEAKER_00]: At cloning process, as I mentioned,
cloning is producing genetically identical
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's true, whether it's cannabis or
anything else, producing more of the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants can easily be cloned, which allows
for many copies of a unique individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a whole population of
plants, and you have one there that really
[SPEAKER_00]: stands out, and for whatever reason you
want to clone that and reproduce those
[SPEAKER_00]: traits, well, that's very easy to do with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are mothers or mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, sometimes we call it stock
plants, and they're used for cloning or
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mother plants are stock plants that
are kept in the vegetative stage of
[SPEAKER_00]: development to allow clones to be taken
for propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's allowing those individuals to be
mass-multiplied, and especially if you
[SPEAKER_00]: find a unique trait, you may want to
continue an entire crop of that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terps, which is short for terpenes,
are fragrant aromatic compounds produced
[SPEAKER_00]: by the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They provide that unique taste and
interact synergistically with compounds in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants, such as cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes are naturally produced to repel
predators and attract pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: These compounds can be impacted by the
climate, the age, and nutrient profile
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plant is receiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Newts is really short for nutrients or
fertilizers, and this is the basic food
[SPEAKER_00]: for the plants to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Newts could be organic fertilizers or
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be synthetics, just referring to
the general classification of nutrients or
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nugs are the trimmed bud or nugget that is
the smokable part of the flower and is of
[SPEAKER_00]: high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can refer to the entire flower,
but more commonly applied to large or
[SPEAKER_00]: small pieces of that particular flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there are a lot of slang terms to
indicate high-quality cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: nugs, also spelled with one-gee,
is an indication of high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG, kind of some debate on what this may
stand for, ocean-grown or original
[SPEAKER_00]: gangster or organically grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a debated topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ocean-grown support is that when the Kush
strain, which came from the Hindu Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: mountains over in Asia, was brought to the
west coast of the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: the terpenes and effects changed,
leading to the term OG Kush to indicate
[SPEAKER_00]: where it was grown and what effects to
expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of support of OG referring to
ocean-grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's also support that OG
stands for original gangster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support is that it originated in Los
Angeles, where OG stands for original
[SPEAKER_00]: gangster, which is where the Kush was
first became popularized or originated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, OG could stand for organically
grown, which matches the general produce
[SPEAKER_00]: abbreviation, but there's no official
organic standard set for cannabis at this
[SPEAKER_00]: time since it just recently became
federally illegal, so it's unlikely this
[SPEAKER_00]: is the true meaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this whole goal was to provide you with
just a couple of the slang terminology
[SPEAKER_00]: used for cannabis, and again, there's much
more, but this hopefully gives you a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a background of some terms
that you may have heard of.
