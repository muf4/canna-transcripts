[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBacco University video,
this is going to cover the three main
[SPEAKER_00]: options when looking at in-row weed
management for a cannabis field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's looking down our rows,
how you're going to best manage the weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in between your plants within the
row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned here to find out the three
methods, as well as the advantages and
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantages of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into in-row weed
management in a cannabis field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off of our three options,
plastic mulch is the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages here is that it's very easy
to get, it's effective for most weeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there are color options for different
situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those color options may offer some
advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disadvantages with plastic mulch is the
initial setup process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be kind of labor intensive or
require special equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also at the end of the season,
the disposal of the plastic mulch can also
[SPEAKER_00]: present an issue to those growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another option might be biodegradable
mulches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage is here is that there's not
really an end of the season disposal
[SPEAKER_00]: issue, at least in most cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, biodegradable mulches can work on
nutsedge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a nutsedge problem or that
weed really be presenting an issue on your
[SPEAKER_00]: particular land, biodegradable mulches can
offer an advantage of being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent that from growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages is that
selecting the one that is the best for
[SPEAKER_00]: your growing conditions, because there are
more options, can be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a potential increase in cost
when using biodegradable mulches,
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely at least compared to the
plastic mulches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, there's just the handled
manual methods, where the advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: ensures someone will be walking the fields
and doing plant inspections.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages is the simple
time and labor that it takes to manually
[SPEAKER_00]: go through and manage the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at these three different
methods, if you want to investigate any of
[SPEAKER_00]: them further, look at other videos here on
