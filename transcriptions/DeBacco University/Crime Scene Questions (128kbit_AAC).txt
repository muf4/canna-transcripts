[SPEAKER_00]: In this video at DeBaca University,
we're going to be investigating crime
[SPEAKER_00]: scene questions, kind of the what,
the who, the where, the when, the how,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the why involved with crime scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, starting with who did it,
you know, that first and initial,
[SPEAKER_00]: some people consider the most important
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we want to be mindful that there could
be one person or there could be multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: people involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're considering who did it,
we may also want to consider who may have
[SPEAKER_00]: a motive to commit such a crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get into, well, what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: So do not make assumptions, and this is
kind of easier said than done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes items may be rearranged to try
to provide a misdirection for the
[SPEAKER_00]: investigator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to be looking at the
details and not make assumptions when
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to answer what may have happened at
the particular crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then where did it happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this here, or is there another
location that might be involved?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you're identifying something
at one particular location, there could be
[SPEAKER_00]: another one involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The actual act may have occurred in one
area, and then there could have been the
[SPEAKER_00]: transportation of the body, for example,
to another physical location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where did it happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not necessarily be the exact
location where the body is found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when did it happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that all important time factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing the time of death can help try to
pinpoint the details of the critical one
[SPEAKER_00]: to two hour time frame before death.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of that crucial time,
that one or two hours, what can be
[SPEAKER_00]: established, how much details can be
gotten about that particular time just
[SPEAKER_00]: before death can really help explain or
provide some great information regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: to the crime scene that they're
investigating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how did it happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what specific items were used in the
scene?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a knife may seem obvious,
but less likely items can be used such as
[SPEAKER_00]: a golf club or extension cord or something
that may have been just lying around the
[SPEAKER_00]: house depending on the act that was
created.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't think it's always the knife.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for a guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be simple household items can
become very vital evidence in crime
[SPEAKER_00]: scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then why did it happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can often be a perplexing
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting at the motive is not always the
main goal, but this can play into the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreation of a scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there an argument before the murder
had occurred, for example?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a potential financial incentives
for one individual to help to explain
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially why did such a crime happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then who was or were the victims?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this example here, do they have any
connections with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where were they one to two hours before
their death?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of that critical time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we establish the time of death for an
individual, try to get as much information
[SPEAKER_00]: around them in that last one to two hours
because that can really help pinpoint or
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminate certain potential suspects when
we're looking at the victim at hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what evidence is there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that the goals were to
help to prove the motive in the crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to document images and sketch the
scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are important aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not necessarily looking at
documenting or making notes to answer
[SPEAKER_00]: these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully through our investigative
process, we'll collect the data and
[SPEAKER_00]: information so that as later in
investigation and looking at the crime
[SPEAKER_00]: scene, these questions can be answered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of that overall summary
there of those questions to just keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind, again, who did it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did it happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, it could be here where you
found the body or it could be another
[SPEAKER_00]: location involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did it happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did it happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who were the victims and what evidence is
there to help prove the motive of that
[SPEAKER_00]: crime?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these questions should hopefully be
answered with the proper forensics
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques and crime scene analysis and
evidence collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
