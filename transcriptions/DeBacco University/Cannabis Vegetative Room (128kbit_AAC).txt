[SPEAKER_00]: The important room in the production of
cannabis is the vegetative room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while this may not have the initial
visual appeal of flowers, we're just
[SPEAKER_00]: producing leaves here, a very critical
room and a very important one to be
[SPEAKER_00]: mindful of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lighting of this room is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this room would favor metal halide or
the new ceramic metal halides or even full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum LED lights running at about 18 to
24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minimum would be about 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't really go that much under that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start running the risk of cutting the
prematurely go in the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: These lights help pay for the development
of necessary leaves and be slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller than the final flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants will be smaller so they
can be a little more packed in,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maintaining that light, maintaining
that continuous hours of light is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where timers become your friend
and they're very critical to maintain that
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 to 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, that full spectrum LEDs or
ceramic metal halides are preferred lights
[SPEAKER_00]: for this particular instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the vegetative room can make or break
the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this may not have the visual appeal
of a full flower room, it is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: important critical room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preparing plants for the soon-to-be stress
of flowering is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we typically don't think of it as the
money room, the vegetative room being
[SPEAKER_00]: where the dollars remain, but that
preparation step is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plants aren't prepared right,
the flower room will suffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though the flower room has the visual
appeal of the flowers, it's very important
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a well-prepared plant before it
goes through the stresses of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you're fertilizing the vegetative
room, you want to monitor growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: and fertilizers are very likely required
at regular intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow formulas, which are typically higher
in nitrogen, are favored during this stage
[SPEAKER_00]: of development, but you want to be mindful
of the amount that you're fertilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you over-fertilize, especially with
irrigation water and over-hydrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in the midst of breaking stems and
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be through the pruning or
trellising process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just become more brittle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a word of caution that you
don't want to have this happen because
[SPEAKER_00]: they may have to go through a physical
moving phase before they go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly here, cleanliness is happiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the important art of pruning
comes into play, where you can see all
[SPEAKER_00]: these have been properly trained.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep the floor clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want any dead leaves either in
the pots or on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This requires constant maintenance and
sweeping and pruning and removing of any
[SPEAKER_00]: dead leaves because if you keep the area
clean, it'll reduce the chance of diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: and ensure a happy crop for both the
plants and also the grower.
