[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
we're going to go through a research
[SPEAKER_00]: article that evaluated the optimum
post-harvest storage conditions for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis terpenes as well as cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is a great research article.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of data presented,
so you are encouraged to download the
[SPEAKER_00]: slides, pause the video, look at the
original research article.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of great information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does get a little complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully here we can break it down for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into evaluating optimum
post-harvest storage conditions of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis terpenes and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: As mentioned before, be sure to look at
the original research article presented
[SPEAKER_00]: right here, fairly recent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go through the data, download it,
and take a look at it for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of great information here.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, let's start with some of the
basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at decarboxylation and
oxidation products of the Delta-9-THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the THCA, oxidation will be
converting it to CBNA and decarboxylation,
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta-9-THC, or if we decarboxylate CBNA,
we get CBN here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we oxidize Delta-9-THC, we also get
CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting into some of the complexities
of the chemical pathways here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's compare of our phyto-cannabinoids
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is looking at the data presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of carries throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBN in whole and ground samples of type
III chemovar, which were qualified by
[SPEAKER_00]: UHPLC and UV at four-month intervals over
the course of a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we see things like T0, T4,
T8, and T12, all of those in our data
[SPEAKER_00]: tables that we're going to see correspond
with the initial time in four,
[SPEAKER_00]: eight, and 12 months of storage
respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go through and we see T0,
that's the initial point, T4 would be four
[SPEAKER_00]: months, T8 would be eight months,
and T12 here would be 12 months or one
[SPEAKER_00]: calendar year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Statistically, significant differences
were observed in all treatments,
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures, and time points compared
with T0, which is the original point,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can see that data presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the different P levels with the
different level of stars or asterisks.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're looking at is whole plant for
THC, Delta-9-THC and CBN, and then ground
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, same thing, Delta-9-THC as well as
CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're noticing overall the general trend
here as we're looking at for T0.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the T0 is that initial,
that's why there's only one bar there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we see four months, eight months,
12 months, four, eight, 12, four,
[SPEAKER_00]: eight, 12, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll notice that this 25 degrees Celsius
temperature had the greatest degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdown there, and the colder
temperatures were relatively similar
[SPEAKER_00]: across the board there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That held true both for the Delta-9-THC as
well as CBD presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, whole versus ground plant samples,
this is one thing that the study did look
[SPEAKER_00]: at, and this comparison of Delta-9-THC and
CBN concentrations in whole and ground
[SPEAKER_00]: samples at different storage temperatures
for four, eight, and 12 months,
[SPEAKER_00]: data presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, here's our four months,
eight months, and one year later held at
[SPEAKER_00]: the different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we see relatively similar results
here, kind of the same thing here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what we do notice down here at one
year, looking at the Delta-9-THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: the 25 degrees Celsius temperatures seem
to have the greatest kind of breakdown
[SPEAKER_00]: evident there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make the cannabinoid comparison
here, comparisons of the full
[SPEAKER_00]: phyto-cannabinoid, CBN, profiles in whole
and ground type I and type III cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: inflorescence after one year of storage at
different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phyto-cannabinoids were identified and
qualified using the very precise methods
[SPEAKER_00]: here at the initial time and after 12
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Storage time zero and T12 respectively,
they looked at an N, which is basically
[SPEAKER_00]: about three plant samples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolute concentrations were color-coded
relative to the maximum value for each
[SPEAKER_00]: compound that we're going to see in the
next slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show some of the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of the background to that
data because I wanted to have it be on the
[SPEAKER_00]: full slide set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as a reminder, as with all the videos
in the description, you can find a link to
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual slides as well as citation for
all the material and images that are used.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be a good time to utilize that
so you can get this kind of good quality
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red and blue arrows indicate
decarboxylation and aging pathways
[SPEAKER_00]: respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing that move through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I position myself, I have to block some
of it sadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're looking at the aging,
the biosynthesis products here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the different components in whole
samples as well as ground samples at
[SPEAKER_00]: different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 12 months, same thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at whole and ground plant
samples and then we have our aging that
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs in decarboxy and it occurs acids to
neutrals there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing the darker colors or darker,
I should say, box highlights represent
[SPEAKER_00]: more than maximum and the white or lighter
coloration showing where the breakdown is
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to kind of move myself kind of
off to the side up here, I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to pause the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is looking at the Delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one we're going to look at is at
the CBD levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same information presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red and blue arrows indicate
decarboxylation and aging pathways
[SPEAKER_00]: respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're seeing basically the same
kind of breakdown or same way that data is
[SPEAKER_00]: presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry, I'll get to some general
conclusions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me move myself again so you can kind
of get an idea of the full data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like about these scientific
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They present you with a lot of
information, a lot of detail, but some
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't really want to be interested
in all the details, want the bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: picture, but I want to provide you with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the general terpene comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comparisons here, looking at just two
terpene concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, looking at the different
temperatures times zero here when they
[SPEAKER_00]: initially harvest and then whole plants
and ground plant samples at the different
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures for our different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Important just to keep in mind that
definitely we're noticing here the initial
[SPEAKER_00]: was definitely higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had degradation at all of these
intervals here at all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just important to keep that in
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at basically time zero and
then four month storage for the duration
[SPEAKER_00]: of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's terpene profiles that we see
kind of the same thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The maximum are 100% and then what they
kind of broke down to their respective
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comparison of terpene profiles and the
whole and ground type three cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: inflorescence after four months of storage
T4 at different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolute concentrations were color coded
relative to the maximum value of each
[SPEAKER_00]: compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here's time zero considered to
be the maximum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see they all had a degree of
breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Darker colorations are representing where
the breakdown was slower and the lighter
[SPEAKER_00]: colorations indicate a more negative or
greater degree of breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for a quick example here,
looking at here, looking at 99,
[SPEAKER_00]: here we looked at like 22%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 22% of what originally it
started with, just to give you a general
[SPEAKER_00]: idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to kind of use that number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, welcome to pause, look at the data
here at the different terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at cannabinoids in solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they also looked at cannabinoids and
how to store these.
[SPEAKER_00]: DMSO, very common solvent used in
scientific laboratories, ethanol and olive
[SPEAKER_00]: oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll notice that there is definitely
this kind of change at these different
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time zero, T6 and T12, so it'd be six
months and then a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we generally notice to kind of
give you the general take home message in
[SPEAKER_00]: both THC and CBD, for the most part,
the olive oil seemed to have the least
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of breakdown compared to DMSO or
ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very important for those looking at
studying these in labs because a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: times DMSO is the lab standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that there was a fair amount,
greater amount of breakdown, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: at 25 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the general conclusions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully all that data didn't scare you
off and you're still here watching the
[SPEAKER_00]: video, but for phyto cannabinoids and
cannabis, inflorescence are more stable
[SPEAKER_00]: during storage compared with extracts
under similar conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenoid concentrations were found to
decrease rapidly under all storage
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, but temperatures lower than
negative 20 degrees Celsius in grinding of
[SPEAKER_00]: the inflorescence were the least favorable
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what should be avoided if you're
looking for long-term storage and
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Olive oil was found to be the best vehicle
for preserving the natural phyto
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid composition of the extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of important note right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lastly, the best preservation
conditions would be storage of the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: inflorescence and extracts dissolved in
olive oil at four degrees Celsius were the
[SPEAKER_00]: optimum post-harvest conditions for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take all that quote confusing
information and here's our quick little
[SPEAKER_00]: general summary here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as always, scientific studies can be
great to investigate and look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to go back, take a look at those,
pause some of those, look in the
[SPEAKER_00]: description, download the videos,
download the slides, take a look at it for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want that quick storage
conditions based on all that data
[SPEAKER_00]: presented, this is your quick little
summary here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you found the scientific study
interesting and will help you better store
[SPEAKER_00]: and maintain the conditions and
preservation of the important cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: and terpenes within your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
