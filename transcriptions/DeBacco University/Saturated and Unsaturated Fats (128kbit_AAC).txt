[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to be looking at
saturated and unsaturated fats.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we see from the initial picture here,
saturated fat is a very linear
[SPEAKER_00]: organization, and unsaturated fats here
have a presence of a double bond,
[SPEAKER_00]: creating this little bit more of a jagged
appearance here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to look at this more on a
little bit of a molecular scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this gives you that quick comparison
of the saturated versus an unsaturated fat
[SPEAKER_00]: that contains at least one double bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fatty acids can be saturated or
unsaturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two main classifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: For saturated fats, which are mostly
animal fats, there's single bonds between
[SPEAKER_00]: all carbon atoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to remember saturated fats,
think of it saturated with hydrogens
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's all single bonds here,
so there's the maximum amount of hydrogens
[SPEAKER_00]: located on this molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unsaturated fats are typically oils,
mostly plant fats.
[SPEAKER_00]: They contain one or more double bond
between carbon atoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this line here indicating a double
bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: This double bond as compared to our
saturated fats will mean there'll be less
[SPEAKER_00]: total hydrogens here compared to
saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unsaturated fats have less total
hydrogens and have this double bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: This double bond causes a fixed point,
and this can cause a change in the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: shape of our fatty acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this picture kind of shows a
nice representation of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, saturated fats, you see saturated
with hydrogens because it's all single
[SPEAKER_00]: bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, unsaturated fats only need one
double bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that double bond can be in the cis
orientation where we see both hydrogens
[SPEAKER_00]: are located on the same side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a trans orientation where
they're located on opposite sides here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that double bond fixes those two
carbons and they're bound together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, we can have a cis form
where they're both on the same side,
[SPEAKER_00]: or we can have a trans form where we have
one that is below the other one there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, saturated all look the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unsaturated only needs one double bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be in a cis or trans form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those saturated fats are typically
solidified when they're cooled.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can raise our cholesterol.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our unsaturated fats are considered to be
more of our good fats.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't raise your cholesterol.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little unstable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do not solidify when cooled.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why these typically are oils
considered good fats.
[SPEAKER_00]: The saturated ones are the butters and
things we may like, the ice creams,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are saturated with hydrogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these typically have negative effects
in the body where we're raising our
[SPEAKER_00]: cholesterol.
[SPEAKER_00]: That saturated and unsaturated,
again, here's how our chains look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highlighted the unsaturated double bond
here in the cis form.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this gives you an idea from that first
image of how our saturated fats look like
[SPEAKER_00]: a very nice, tight line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unsaturated fats have at least one
double bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, there's two.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has a little bit more of a notched
appearance located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comparing our fat composition,
so oils, as I said, have less of those
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated fats and a greater portion of
those monounsaturated, which would be one
[SPEAKER_00]: double bond, or polyunsaturated,
which would be multiple double bonds
[SPEAKER_00]: formed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dairy products, you can see a much higher
portion of saturated fats and little to
[SPEAKER_00]: almost none of polyunsaturated fats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some other meat products here
just to give you that kind of general
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at some other classifications
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our nuts, sweet and baked goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see just on a quick comparison
the change in the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: polyunsaturated fats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same here, butter, very high
percentage of saturated fats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just a good comparison and a
good resource to look at and compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, the cis-nose transforms,
cis being on the same side with that
[SPEAKER_00]: double bond, trans being on opposite sides
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to see how different those
molecules look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now important to remember these because
trans fats do not occur in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fats that look like this, where our
hydrons are on opposite sides,
[SPEAKER_00]: believe it or not, do not occur in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see an evidence here of that trans fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they do exist, but they don't
occur in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they occur typically when we process
foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cis structure in your body is able
to process and maintain its cell
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trans are not helpful for the body and
linked to cancer and heart disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important of the structure of
these molecules and how it impacts our
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Artificial trans fats are created in
industrial process that adds hydrogen to
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid vegetable oils, making them more
solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an advantage here in the
processing industry, which is why some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these have been created.
[SPEAKER_00]: The primary dietary source for trans fats
is processed foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's partially hydrogenated oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, and now we're seeing the
negative and linking these negative
[SPEAKER_00]: effects to these trans fats, we're now
seeing them required to be on nutrition
[SPEAKER_00]: factor labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So foods are required to state trans fat
on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take a look and know what you're
eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result of this, companies are now
going about different ways to achieve the
[SPEAKER_00]: same end result without creating trans
fats because of their negative impacts on
[SPEAKER_00]: the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, now with the label laws having
companies required to state this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can easily check to see if there's any
trans fats in the food you are consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
