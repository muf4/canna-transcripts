[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
we're going to be covering CBD and CBDA
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, commonly referred to as
cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so you may have heard of CBD or
cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the molecular structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're going to be getting into CBD
as well as CBDA regarding cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: produced by cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, here's a great research
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to take a look at some
information that's pulled from here,
[SPEAKER_00]: goes from many other cannabinoids as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the proper citation if you want
to learn about these in even more detail
[SPEAKER_00]: than presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at conversion by heat
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBDA is converted to CBD by heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp, which is classified as cannabis
containing less than 0.3% total THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: is often grown for the production of CBD
or cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD has dozens of known therapeutic uses,
including the reduction of inflammation
[SPEAKER_00]: and in some cases, often anecdotally,
the reduction of anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're seeing the CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're adding heat and that we're
generating the CBD and carbon dioxide as a
[SPEAKER_00]: byproduct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that two should be down here
from a true chemical standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a chemist, kind of don't like the fact
that the two in CO2 is written as a
[SPEAKER_00]: superscript when it actually should be a
subscript.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check the description for the citation of
that source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBDA synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're looking at and how we're
going about synthesizing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, CBDA is synthesized by CBDA
synthase, which is expressed by type three
[SPEAKER_00]: or BDBD plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although type two and three are used for
hemp production, only type three plants
[SPEAKER_00]: will remain compliant through maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that compliant is having a lower than
0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reduction in the, I should say the
reaction by which CBDA synthesis produces
[SPEAKER_00]: CBDA from CBGA creates phytotoxic
byproducts and therefore takes place in
[SPEAKER_00]: the appleplastic space of the trichome
secretory vesicle, much like THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was this kind of summary mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because we're having other
byproducts being produced by this process,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is occurring within the trichome,
but in the appleplastic space because the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant needs to go through and kind of
detoxify some other products or rid itself
[SPEAKER_00]: of some other waste products that are
being converted or generated as part of
[SPEAKER_00]: this conversion process through enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at CBD related to seizures in
particular, it has been clinically proven
[SPEAKER_00]: that CBD is a remarkable effective
treatment in severe epileptic seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlotte Figge became a poster child for
CBD seizure medications and helped create
[SPEAKER_00]: advocacy, which led to the introduction of
this particular prescribed or
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription, I should say, Epidiolex for
an extremely successful medicine for
[SPEAKER_00]: childhood epileptic seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a great video here on Tobacco
University that goes into a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more about Charlotte Figge, sadly passed
away at the age of 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's said to have done a lot of good for
the cannabis industry in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll talk about the commercially
available CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is widely used and accepted
cannabinoid available on the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of products there.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, keep in mind that anything you're
looking at potentially purchasing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be getting an analytical report
that will not only gives you the compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: that it contains, but proof that it has
passed all sorts of all the regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: and necessary beyond just a flashy label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure that you are an informed consumer
with any products you're looking at purchasing.
