[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes in a molecular biology lab
you'll hear people that you think are lost
[SPEAKER_00]: and using a compass to try to find their
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blotting compass because a lot
of the blots get their names from cardinal
[SPEAKER_00]: directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are blots in molecular biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well starting first with a southern blot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A southern blot is a sensitive method for
detection of a DNA sequence within a
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DNA is first cleaved or cut with
restriction enzymes to produce fragments
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be separated by gel
electrophoresis.
[SPEAKER_00]: After electrophoresis DNA fragments are
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane
[SPEAKER_00]: by capillary action creating a replica of
the original gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The membrane is incubated with a labeled
probe which binds to and detects fragments
[SPEAKER_00]: of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our DNA, we have our gel,
run it through, we have this transfer
[SPEAKER_00]: step, we have this blotting step and
ultimately what we're left with is what
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like lines in a column.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically this is looking at DNA and
this is why it is the southern blotting
[SPEAKER_00]: technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast we have the northern blotting
technique and this is a method for
[SPEAKER_00]: detection of specific mRNA in a mixture of
RNAs looking at specifically messenger
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while it looks very similar to the
southern blot we just saw, lines in a
[SPEAKER_00]: column, this is looking at something very
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: However like southern blotting this method
is highly specific and sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA from cells and tissues is extracted
and separated by electrophoresis.
[SPEAKER_00]: As in southern blotting RNA is transferred
to a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated
[SPEAKER_00]: with a labeled probe that is complementary
to the RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This method can be used to quantate the
transcription of RNA under different
[SPEAKER_00]: cellular conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of a way to get the sense
of the amount and you can see kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: end result located here for northern
blotting looking at mRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's also western blotting which
again has a very similar image if you just
[SPEAKER_00]: look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But western blotting is a laboratory
method used to detect specific proteins or
[SPEAKER_00]: protein molecules among a mixture of
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: This mixture can include all of the
proteins associated with a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue or cell type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Western blots can also be used to evaluate
the size of the protein of interest and
[SPEAKER_00]: used to measure the amount of protein
expression that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: This procedure was named similarity to its
previously invented method known as the
[SPEAKER_00]: southern blot and that's why this one gets
the term the western blot looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: specific protein molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these three molecules can kind of like
compare these three blotting techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at three different molecules can
kind of be compared here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of get the idea of the southern
blotting in the first column, the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: column being northern and the last column
here being western blotting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how there's some similarities
between them but also some differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part looking at different
identifying markers or molecules in this
[SPEAKER_00]: case DNA, looking at RNA and looking at
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm just going to mention here at the
very end some other blots because those
[SPEAKER_00]: are the major ones but there is if you're
wondering there is an eastern blot,
[SPEAKER_00]: a far western blot, a southwestern,
reverse northern blot, and a dot blot as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these looking at very specific
things all different blots southern,
[SPEAKER_00]: northern, and western are by far the most
common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eastern blot is used for detection of
post-transitional modifications of
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Far western uses antibodies to detect the
presence of protein-protein complexes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This southwestern blot is based off the
southern blot that's where it kind of gets
[SPEAKER_00]: part of its name from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used to identify characterizing DNA
binding proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reverse northern blot differs from both
northern and southern blot in that the DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: is first immobilized in a blotting matrix
and specific sequences are detected with
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled RNA probes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see we get into some little bit
different protocols as far as the
[SPEAKER_00]: procedures to carry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly the dot blot is a special case
of any of the above blots where it does
[SPEAKER_00]: now annihilate these added directly to the
blotting matrix and appears as dots as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to separating the sample with
electrophoresis prior to blotting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one is a little bit different the
rest definitely depend heavily on
[SPEAKER_00]: electrophoresis and separating things out
in a gel before transferring them to
[SPEAKER_00]: another membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again this is just kind of that basic
overview of all the different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: blots that may occur and hopefully this
makes a little bit more sense and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not completely lost in the kernel
directions of molecular biology.
