[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University student series,
we're going to get to see Kira's many jobs
[SPEAKER_00]: in the early season of 2023, where she's
progressing from a student to becoming an
[SPEAKER_00]: employee and learning all aspects of
cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, if you thought cannabis growing
was just the plants, well, Kira is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to walk us through some different aspects
that she is getting exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always nice to see her student
kind of progress to become an employee.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's worked her way up to being a true
employee here at Sweet Heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: She discusses the importance of being
versatile and flexible since different
[SPEAKER_00]: times of the year require different tasks
to be completed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see the early springtime
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This end all is working directly with the
plants, but she also has some additional
[SPEAKER_00]: tasks that are important to make the
entire system, company and growing
[SPEAKER_00]: environment work to everyone's advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now she's going to start us off in the
nursery house, which is her main job right
[SPEAKER_00]: now in the springtime where she's taken a
bunch of clones, getting plants
[SPEAKER_00]: established, she's been scouting for pests
and being proactive in defenses against
[SPEAKER_00]: those pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the daily plant care,
checking, making sure monitoring the
[SPEAKER_00]: water, making sure everything is labeled
and just making sure the plants are able
[SPEAKER_00]: to show their best work so they can
continue into a good vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear from Kira now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi everyone, it's Kira.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today I'm back at Sweet Heal or as
it's known as Gigi Agtech, where I took
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys last year for a few tours of
their facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm an official employee and I want to
tell you about the different jobs that I
[SPEAKER_01]: have around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now we're in our nursery,
which is where we have all of our little
[SPEAKER_01]: baby plants just start out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much one of my first jobs here was
taking many, many, many clones of our
[SPEAKER_01]: mother plants and putting them into rock
wool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they get their roots in and
everything and they're ready to be
[SPEAKER_01]: transplanted, we bring them into here and
plant them based on base.
[SPEAKER_01]: This here is all Miss B, all in front of
me, all behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of our other plants in here
include Sour Lifter or Durban Poison.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really these Miss B's are my babies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another job that I typically do while I'm
here is give amendments to these girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're pretty much raising them,
so we need to make sure that they're happy
[SPEAKER_01]: and healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the amendments that we add are
these marigold plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marigolds are great for deterring pests
like aphids and thrips from your plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: as I guess they don't really like the
smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that we do to amend our
plants are add beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the insects that we do add are
ladybugs and praying mantises.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our ladybugs also eat aphids and thrips
and praying mantises really eat anything
[SPEAKER_01]: they could get their hands on,
which is good for us when we're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: eliminate the pests that we don't want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also helps that they're super cute.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my first and main job,
which is just taking care of the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: making sure the girls are good and
everything that comes with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do have a few different jobs around
here, as does everyone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only way to keep this entire
greenhouse going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with cannabis, not all jobs are flashy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Labeling is very important, and it's a
critical form of documentation,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we'll see from Kiara.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my most important and arguably most
overlooked jobs in this field is labeling
[SPEAKER_01]: our cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take great pride in making sure that all
of our labels are big, legible,
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of cute.
[SPEAKER_01]: For each of our plants, it's kind of hard
to tell the difference between the two if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're different species or anything,
based off of the appearance alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why it is so important to have
big, consistent labeling for all of your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if they are organized in a way that
makes it kind of easy to guess and figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out what type of plant you have,
you never really know which one it could
[SPEAKER_01]: be.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is Sour Lifter, while the one
right next door that looks pretty similar
[SPEAKER_01]: to it is actually Cherry Wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is very important for all grows of
any scale or no matter the grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be efficiently and properly labeling
your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a step you definitely don't want
to overlook or skip in the interest of
[SPEAKER_01]: time, because at the end of the day,
if you don't know what the difference
[SPEAKER_01]: between your plants are, you're going to
lose incredible amounts of profit and be
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of upset that you could have just
done that in a half a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, having a good customer connection and
good marketing is very important because,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately, customers don't get to see
the actual plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The products get the most eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ensuring the product is well presented is
critical to keep the business going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs that continued attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a great indoor job for Keira.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one of my jobs that I kind of
didn't expect going into this field was
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with our customers and marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in order for any operation to really
run smoothly, everybody kind of needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: be on board with everything and helping
out where they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally have a big love for editing
things on my phone or making things just
[SPEAKER_01]: look pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I offer to do some of our promo for our
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you see here is a light box that I
like to use to take photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: In here we have our canagars, very pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we need to make sure that we get
good photos of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go and I'll take my photos that I
take here, put them into some form of
[SPEAKER_01]: editing app, and create tear-away sheets,
advertisements, posters, informationals
[SPEAKER_01]: about each of our products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it really just depends on the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, depending on if we change our
packaging or if the laws ever change,
[SPEAKER_01]: we pretty much need to update these all of
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a very critical part of any
business to make sure that you have
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody working on marketing and farming
your customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, this is what gets
your customers' attention and not just how
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty the plants are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I'm taking promotional pictures
for our canagars.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is our Sweet Elite Mountain
Mango, and I want to make it look as
[SPEAKER_01]: appetizing as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really have a specific list that I
go through when I'm making these types of
[SPEAKER_01]: projects, but I just kind of go with what
the product really entails.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are very slim, pretty, so I could
just put as many as I want, really,
[SPEAKER_01]: in here next to each other, make it look
pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it look aesthetically pleasing,
get my photos, isolate them within an app,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it looks like you hired a
professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this is why I really enjoy being able
to do all of our advertising and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: customer-based things, since I,
being a perfectionist, like to see things
[SPEAKER_01]: like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, this is my more indoor job in
Sweet Heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, potting up plants may seem
repetitive, but there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: preparation, checking, and double-checking
of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the planting process can get
routine, the volume and high standards
[SPEAKER_00]: makes this an all-hands-on-deck job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, an incredible amount of prep
work is required in order to even think
[SPEAKER_01]: about having the plants into this bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm not sure if you could tell by
the camera angle or not, but none of these
[SPEAKER_01]: pots actually have plants in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've spent weeks cleaning this
greenhouse, sweeping, bleaching,
[SPEAKER_01]: making sure that everything's clean,
getting our compost together, which we
[SPEAKER_01]: make ourselves at Sweet Heal, in order to
make sure that our plants get proper
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and a proper home to stay in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we make our own compost based off
of our organic material that we go through
[SPEAKER_01]: while doing our basic day-to-day things
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to make sure that our drip lines
are all properly working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if just one of those doesn't work,
then we lose an entire plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, as meticulous and tedious as it is,
we make sure that every single one of them
[SPEAKER_01]: is up and functioning before the plant
comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have this entire bay to cover
before we can say that plants are even
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed to come in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we do finally put the plants in here,
I would say it will take about two weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe more, but I hope to show you it when
we're done instead of talking about all
[SPEAKER_01]: the prep work.
[SPEAKER_01]: In case you thought planting was easy
work, I kind of wanted to describe to you
[SPEAKER_01]: how I go about planting our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here it seems pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a hemp plant and a pot,
but it's actually way more than that and
[SPEAKER_01]: takes up a lot of my time, especially
during this part of our growth season,
[SPEAKER_01]: working here.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to get this plant to look like
this, we first have to take a clone of it
[SPEAKER_01]: from a mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: We then put it into rock wool and let it
root for about two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we transplant it into a smaller
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, once we think it's ready
there, it can go into this container.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it's in this container, we make sure
that we add our drip lines for irrigation,
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that all of our fertilizers are
properly working and of the right amounts,
[SPEAKER_01]: and add rice holes to the top to prevent
the soil layer from being all moist and
[SPEAKER_01]: encouraging bud growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, imagine this one plant multiplied by
the entirety of this greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a few days now, my team and I have
been working on this bay alone,
[SPEAKER_01]: right what you see in front of me and
behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But everything in this direction has still
yet to be potted completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can imagine how much time it takes
us just to get a few plants into some
[SPEAKER_01]: pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of work, but it's a lot of
work.
