[SPEAKER_00]: All right, shown in the images here is
botrytis, also known as gray mold,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you might be familiar with it on
strawberries that have gone bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of what it looks like
zoomed in a little bit more, almost at the
[SPEAKER_00]: microscopic level here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can see that there's clearly an
evidence of this kind of grayish kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: mold look.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be very powdery when touched,
and it can, as a result, easily spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a disease that we want to be
mindful of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we are looking to identify it,
it's some gross thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it bud rot, but scientifically it
is botrytis, a scenario, and can cause
[SPEAKER_00]: more extensive problems as it spreads.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can spread very quickly, and a lot of
it comes from direct contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: The indica cultivars tend to be more
susceptible to this disease, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: indicated by this white, grazy,
fuzziness appearance that we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can create fine dust as released when
moved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can spread this fungi to neighboring
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rarely is there just one infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, if you find one, sadly,
you're going to find many more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where to look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it can affect all plant parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's evident by that gray cotton-like
look on appearance, which is evident by
[SPEAKER_00]: brown necrotic, which is dead regions that
are occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that clearly evident here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it can occur anywhere, but it's
commonly found in dense areas of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, particularly the buds, because it's
kind of protected there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it needs this kind of moisture content
to be able to thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, while it can technically
occur anywhere, looking at these areas
[SPEAKER_00]: that are typically protected in areas of
higher moisture content, these are areas
[SPEAKER_00]: typically where it will first appear and
where you should be inspecting first.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because it's found in high humidity
conditions with poor air circulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to avoid these particular
conditions to reduce or discourage the
[SPEAKER_00]: formation of botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early detection and sanitation are
important because it can spread so
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the earlier you can find even small
amounts of it, the quicker you can take
[SPEAKER_00]: proactive measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: For outdoor operation, avoid overhead
watering, if that's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fungus can overwinter in dead plant
tissues or anything that needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just put it to the edge of the area
you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physically remove it to a distant off-site
location, ideally.
[SPEAKER_00]: For control, you want to discard infected
plant debris upon detection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a way to dry leaves out quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungus sites can be an option,
but typically aren't advised, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: on the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of residuals that could occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that key part is to find it,
remove it, dry the leaves out,
[SPEAKER_00]: try to discourage its formation in the
first place, and hopefully that will offer
[SPEAKER_00]: you effective season-long control.
Thank you.
