[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
we're going to be looking at beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: insects for aphids in cannabis production
and how you can utilize these beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: insects instead of insecticides for
controlling an aphid population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so let's get into the video here
to help you control your aphids with
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a link to the article and the
proper citation for that article if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to look at more of the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly of their materials and
methods, and they studied more than just
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids in this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, challenges in the greenhouse
production just in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, greenhouse cannabis cultivation and
insect infestations can cause many losses
[SPEAKER_00]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Synthetic chemicals and insecticides have
been a go-to option in the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: but with the stringent scanning of final
flower in materials and legal restrictions
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as applications of any sort of
products, this is all the driving force
[SPEAKER_00]: between the development of a new
environmentally friendly and profitable
[SPEAKER_00]: methods for insect control for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the greenhouse study is a little bit of
the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was conducted in the Agriculture
University of Athens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis plants were grown in two
different greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beneficial insects were released only
in one greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The treatment, as we'll see, and no
additional pesticides were used during
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you the monaceous variety that
was used as well as the temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity fluctuations for the growing
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the beneficial insects were released
three weeks after the transplantation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insects were released to the
treated greenhouse in order to assess the
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency of the biological pest
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the species here that we're going to
focus on is aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the main one that was
identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is generally how they look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you a little bit more specifics
of some variants, just to give you an idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of how small they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't seen them, they tend to be
found also on the underside of the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: at least initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the basic measures here, here we can
see a bunch of different insects and all
[SPEAKER_00]: identified right down there, but basic
measurements include visual estimations of
[SPEAKER_00]: the infestation, recording of the pest
species and populations, and comparison of
[SPEAKER_00]: infestations between the two greenhouses,
and only the nymphs and adult stages of
[SPEAKER_00]: the pest were counted, not the egg stage
for any of the insects that they studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the pest population determination,
how was that determined?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the pest populations were taken
in the third, fifth, and seventh,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ninth week of the growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of aphid pests was counted with
a hand lens in order to identify the
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency of the beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Average pest populations were measured in
10 plants, four leaves per plant per
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse on average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important with any pest that we're
looking at studying, and this is true for
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids as well as others, to have an idea
what the life cycle is of that pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's a lot of information here,
so you're welcome to pause the video and
[SPEAKER_00]: take a look at it more yourself,
but the key parts here are that they're a
[SPEAKER_00]: piercing, sucking insect, and aphids can
also transmit viruses as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be a vector for viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another reason to keep their
numbers under control on top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: physical damage they can do, also the
transmission of viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they have a complex life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's kind of weird about aphids in
particular is that females can give birth
[SPEAKER_00]: to live, already pregnant, young female
clones, so it's kind of like they can
[SPEAKER_00]: really mass multiply very, very fast,
so keep that in mind as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, identification of aphids,
while we're going to kind of generally put
[SPEAKER_00]: them all in the same general
classification here of aphids,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you just to realize that there are
different species, cotton or melon aphids,
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to your green peach potato,
tobacco aphids, or your true potato
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids, your foxglove aphids, how all of
these are in the same category,
[SPEAKER_00]: but their head shapes can be used for
identification, coloration, and some more
[SPEAKER_00]: details here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you had aphids and identified them
with a magnifying loop, you can probably
[SPEAKER_00]: identify the specific type that you have
in your particular growing operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as beneficial insects that target
aphids, this is what the study looked at,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they looked at the aphidias
combination here, and they are small
[SPEAKER_00]: wasps, and they parasitize the aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here this wasp actually infects
the aphids with small little eggs that go
[SPEAKER_00]: on to complete their life cycle,
and then basically eventually just take
[SPEAKER_00]: out the aphid population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many species do occur in the northeast and
enter greenhouses naturally, so this is
[SPEAKER_00]: why broad insecticide killing of
everything is not advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you also the life cycle here of
the aphidias as well, and there's about a
[SPEAKER_00]: two-week life cycle for them, and this is
ready to infect those aphids there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows you a little size and visual
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another beneficial insect here,
these are green lacewings, chrysophilia
[SPEAKER_00]: carneria, and they are green lacewings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see an adult right here,
and then we see the larval stage here,
[SPEAKER_00]: so very contrasting larval to adult stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, some more information here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their eggs kind of of the green lacewings
are kind of like these white little areas
[SPEAKER_00]: on a thin little hair, kind of suspended
there, so you can take a look and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully find some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of, again, shows you their
life cycle as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both of these are beneficial insects
specifically to target if you have aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the other controls, so how are they,
you know, how are the application methods?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for the aphidias here, they were put
in what's called dye boxes, which are like
[SPEAKER_00]: little boxes that basically hang within
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lacewings, the larvae, was basically
introduced by sprinkling the content from
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottle around the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times this comes in sawdust or
rice hulls, so they're very, very small,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you're spreading that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind you want to keep these
well spread because the green lacewings
[SPEAKER_00]: can cannibalize themselves before growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going after any aphid species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what did the numbers look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did the data actually show?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of provides you an idea of
the actual data here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall great reduction in aphid
numbers with the beneficial insect
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Final numbers may not be zero in a
population, but to have only about four
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half per plant when treated with the
beneficial insects compared to 300 in
[SPEAKER_00]: control plants shows a massive reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you the specific kind of
information right here, their data table,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the graph really speaks to the
treatment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially week three, populations in
both greenhouses were relatively the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least not statistically different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the control, which is the one
that did not have any beneficial insects,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it massively went through an
exponential increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did drop a little for week nine,
but when we compare these to the control
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments, the ones that had the
beneficial insects, we can see they're
[SPEAKER_00]: ever decreasing numbers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a great benefit to utilizing these
beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So average number of pests in the
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, this study did look at other
insects, but focusing specifically on the
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what the numbers I quoted
before, average number of pest populations
[SPEAKER_00]: in the treatment greenhouse in 80 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see the great comparison
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How I got that down only 368 per 80
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are numbers are per week here,
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a continuous reduction in all pest
populations was observed that the
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment approaching zero value per
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of maybe not reaching zero,
but definitely getting very close to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what was not mentioned in this study
was actually lady beetles, which a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: you may think of when you hear aphids,
you may think, oh, I treat with lady
[SPEAKER_00]: beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, keep in mind, if you are going to go
with lady beetles, they can kind of tear
[SPEAKER_00]: it rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not handled properly,
you can have a lot of loss or death loss
[SPEAKER_00]: there, die back on ones that you're
purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep them refrigerated if they cannot
be used immediately, but should be used
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use adequate release dates, oftentimes
repeated applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: About seven days apart is needed for if
you're utilizing lady beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lady beetles need a good supply of aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your populations of aphids is really
low, consider other options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Release lady beetles at the dusk or early
evening, kind of when the sun or lights
[SPEAKER_00]: are kind of going off there to avoid the
heat of the day upon their initial
[SPEAKER_00]: release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expect lady beetles to fly away in a few
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 95% of lady beetles will fly away in
48 hours with the rest being gone in 40
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four to five days, and they are unlikely
to lay eggs in your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if aphids do return, you'll have to
re-induce lady beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably why they weren't a participant in
this particular study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are beneficial insects worth the
effort?
[SPEAKER_00]: I get this question a lot, and in short,
yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This study indicates that beneficial
insects could control pest populations up
[SPEAKER_00]: to 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pest management with natural enemies is
promising, very effective, safe method for
[SPEAKER_00]: plant protection, as well as applicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a little effort there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The timing is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep all of that in mind, which you can
have great control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, what growers need to keep in mind
is really that proper pest identification
[SPEAKER_00]: is important, since this will determine
the exact beneficial insect to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you misdiagnose the insect,
if you misdiagnose it and you apply the
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong beneficial insects, it's going to be
very little effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this does require, by the grower,
frequent scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timing and rate of beneficial insects is
also important, and depending on what
[SPEAKER_00]: insect you're trying to target,
different areas we can purchase those
[SPEAKER_00]: insects will provide those
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this was helpful to you to
identify and control aphid populations,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this can hopefully help save your
plants in an environmentally friendly way.
