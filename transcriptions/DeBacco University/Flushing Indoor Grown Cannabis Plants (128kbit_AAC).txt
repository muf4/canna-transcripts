[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing cannabis plants indoors
and want to know how to properly flush
[SPEAKER_00]: them, this DeBaco University video is for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at flushing indoor
grown cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I want you to realize that
there is not a standardized method.
[SPEAKER_00]: No studies have been published to date to
examine the exact process of flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why you're probably hearing and
searching for this video, because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this does not mean that it's not
common practice, as the idea to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: high quality bud is also to minimize the
inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have the greatest quality bud
with the minimum amount of inputs to,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, maximize the efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal of any flushing protocol is to
reduce nutrient concentrations in the root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone so the plant metabolizes what is
already present in the plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why we typically overwater plants as
part of flushing to kind of flush out
[SPEAKER_00]: those excess salts, those excess nutrients
with adding just pure water to the root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone of the cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what water properties are we looking
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, ideally, water should be around room
temperature, 70, 75 degrees Fahrenheit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and have slightly acidic pH value of 6.0
to 6.3 to aid in the ability to ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients are soluble and easily removed
from the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning if you have cold water and the pH
is off, that could affect the efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: and effectiveness of the ability to flush
out those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can impact that ability for that kind
of flushing, or the goal here of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing of those nutrients out,
which is an important consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the first nutrient to go,
if you're flushing, what's going to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: first nutrient you're going to lose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, nitrogen is the most water-soluble
of the nutrients, so watch for a potential
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency of this nutrient first in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is characterized by the yellowing of
lower leaves, while the upper portions of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant remain green, at least for a
period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start to see this yellow
coloration, you might be flushing too
[SPEAKER_00]: early and too aggressively because the
plant is visually showing you it's running
[SPEAKER_00]: out of nutrients, particularly nitrogen in
this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be a sign, make note,
look back at your records.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be flushing a little too early
or with a little bit too much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the timing is very important when
you're looking at this flushing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to time the reduction in
nutrients with the harvesting of the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plant runs out of nutrients,
this should be very close to harvesting so
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no plant stunting or any chance of
a potential yield reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is best done if you're going to be
harvesting the entire plant and not doing
[SPEAKER_00]: a selective bud harvest, as this may
result in the second harvest being
[SPEAKER_00]: negatively impacted by the reduction in
plant available nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as the picture shows here,
timing is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have a comfortable idea of
when you'll be harvesting your plants so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can plan your no nutrient adding your
flushing accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, indoor substrate categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, just because you're
growing indoors doesn't mean everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: follows the exact same protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydroponics require the least amount of
time between stopping nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where substrate-based indoor grows,
the exact type used can impact the timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're in a pure hydroponic
situation here, if a type of essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate-free system being used,
such as aeroponics or deep water culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots will immediately lose access to
nutrients once you add in only plain water
[SPEAKER_00]: to their reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, you should only be running
plants with no nutrients for about a three
[SPEAKER_00]: to four day flush period if you're doing
one of these growing situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, the risk of nutrient
deficiencies will definitely increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, looking at hydroponics
substrate-based flushing, this gets a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more complicated because
there's many different substrate options.
[SPEAKER_00]: When plants are grown in the substrate,
though, there will be some retention of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, but this will be in part
substrate-dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you're growing in clay
pebbles or other material that require
[SPEAKER_00]: near continual irrigation, the three to
four day recommendation for the hydroponic
[SPEAKER_00]: environment can be followed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning once you determine I'm going to
harvest my buds in about three to four
[SPEAKER_00]: days, then you can stop adding any
nutrients and just only add water to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you're growing in a peat moss
or cocoa-based substrate, the duration of
[SPEAKER_00]: time of flushing can be increased to four
to seven days, almost a week from your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a soil-less mix,
this can get more complicated because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the variability of components that exist
in this category.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in general, this can be the
longest interval, should be about five to
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 days of period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that also based on how aggressively
you have fed during the flowering cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of that flowering phase will also
impact the concentrations in substrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: will likely be if you're a very heavy
nutrient feeder, you're going to have more
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in that substrate, potentially
than if you were fertilizing a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more on the lighter scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take that also into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the basics flushing protocol?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in a pure hydroponic setup,
simple change the water with new water
[SPEAKER_00]: that does not contain any nutrients,
but is pH appropriate, fairly easy in that
[SPEAKER_00]: regards.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you're looking at a hydroponic
substrate, then you irrigate as you
[SPEAKER_00]: normally would only with water,
no nutrients added, which should be until
[SPEAKER_00]: the water comes out of the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this water leaving the root zone
should be tested for EC, electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: connectivity, parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to increase the duration of
irrigation until the readings are reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: to a near plain water levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know the water going in,
you water the plant, you get the water
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out, you test that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting a very high reading
initially, keep watering, keep watering
[SPEAKER_00]: until that reading starts to become
decreased.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will ensure the root zone has been
properly and significantly flushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the basic flushing protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone wants to know how much water
should I add per container, but really
[SPEAKER_00]: having these meters, being able to dial it
in for your particular setup is how you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to ensure you're getting that proper
flushing of that root zone.
Thank you.
