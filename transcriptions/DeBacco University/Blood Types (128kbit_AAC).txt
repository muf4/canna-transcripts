[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, in this video we're going to go over
blood types and hopefully give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: greater understanding than just the fact
that there's A, B, and O blood types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with antibodies and blood
transfusions, it's very important to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify someone's blood type if we're
looking at transfusing their blood or even
[SPEAKER_00]: donating blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So blood typing of the ABO system is the
major groups of red blood cell antigens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we have here is an example of a
person who are type A here, make
[SPEAKER_00]: antibodies against antigen B.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a red blood cell type A,
you have antibodies in your plasma that
[SPEAKER_00]: are anti-B because your antigens are type
A as we see indicated here by the circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a type B blood type,
B blood type, you make antigens against A
[SPEAKER_00]: because your antibodies against A because
you have the antigen B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're an AB blood type,
you don't make any antibodies against A or
[SPEAKER_00]: B because you express both of these
antigens on the surface of your red blood
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, if you're a group O
in this case, you do make antibodies
[SPEAKER_00]: against A and B because you have no
markers on your red blood cells and
[SPEAKER_00]: therefore you're not expressing any
antigens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, you may have heard of A
negative and A positive or O negative and
[SPEAKER_00]: O positive and may wonder what the
positive and negative means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this refers to the RH factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: RH is abbreviation for recidivism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an antigen occurring on the red blood
cells of many humans about 85% and some
[SPEAKER_00]: other primates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's particularly important as a cause of
hemolytic disease of newborns and
[SPEAKER_00]: incompatibility in blood transfusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does it really matter if you're A or B
blood type or positive or negative?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in your day to day life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're looking particularly at
potentially blood diseases and blood
[SPEAKER_00]: transfusions, well now this positive and
negative A and B and O types do become
[SPEAKER_00]: very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of if you know your blood type,
you can kind of compare here to see where
[SPEAKER_00]: you may fall if you're part of the
majority or the minority here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that the majority,
no matter what blood type across what
[SPEAKER_00]: race, the positive is always a greater
number than the negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because, flipping back to the
previous slide, you'll notice about 85% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the population is positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for expressing the RH factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of pause the video here
and take a comparison here and see where
[SPEAKER_00]: you may fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on from the red blood cell type
frequency, we go to the distribution of
[SPEAKER_00]: those blood types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you're welcome to pause the
video here in this slide and take a look
[SPEAKER_00]: at some of the distributions of either the
A type, the B type, or the O blood groups
[SPEAKER_00]: and where they fall, where they're
typically found in different regions of
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, no major advantage to be any one
group versus the other, but it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting to see how different subsets
of populations do develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is an important red blood cell
compatibility table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll move myself up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at our recipients and
our donors and our O negatives,
[SPEAKER_00]: our O positives, our A negatives,
our A positives, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The take home message from this is that if
you're an AB blood type, you're what's
[SPEAKER_00]: called the universal recipient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're able to basically receive blood
from anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at the positive RH
positive in this case, as you'll notice
[SPEAKER_00]: the RH negatives do have some exceptions
to this rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, AB positive is a
universal recipient.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can receive blood from anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: What blood type is really sought after for
blood drives in particular are what's O
[SPEAKER_00]: blood type, particularly O negative,
because they're the universal donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can give their blood or donate their
blood to any one of these types here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that's often called as the
universal recipient, but to receive blood,
[SPEAKER_00]: the universal donor able to give blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Antibodies and blood transfusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking specifically at some examples
and how these positive and negatives can
[SPEAKER_00]: impact someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The RH factor is another group of antigens
found on red blood cells, erythrocytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: RH positive people have them, means
they're positively there.
[SPEAKER_00]: RH negative people don't have the RH
factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's of particular significance when an RH
negative mother gives birth to an RH
[SPEAKER_00]: positive baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mother may be exposed to fetal blood
and thus produce anti-RH antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a example here again.
[SPEAKER_00]: RH negative mother gives birth to an RH
positive baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mother can actually develop antibodies
to their own fetus.
[SPEAKER_00]: In subsequent RH positive pregnancy,
so that's second born, this can lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: the erythroblast fatalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be prevented by injecting the
mother with anti-RH antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is possible, we just have to be
aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be wondering, well why or how
can a mother whose RH negative give birth
[SPEAKER_00]: to a baby whose RH positive?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that comes down to what the blood type
the father is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see this indication here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And homozygous dominant and heterozygous
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some of the possible outcomes
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the father is positive and the mother
is negative, well then all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring here will be positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the different combinations
here of what potential their offspring
[SPEAKER_00]: options are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of put this situation here in a
little bit of a pictorial form.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at this image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see going on here is we have
our RH positive father and RH negative
[SPEAKER_00]: mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the mother here is carrying a fetus
that's RH positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because the blood type came from
the father.
[SPEAKER_00]: Antigens will develop in the mother and
she'll develop antibodies in response to
[SPEAKER_00]: this fetal RH positives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is crucial for particularly the
second born because she's she'll come in
[SPEAKER_00]: contact with that blood during delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, she'll develop antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what becomes important is if the
mother becomes pregnant with another child
[SPEAKER_00]: and that child does happen to be RH
positive, well she will now have
[SPEAKER_00]: antibodies that can cross the placenta and
damage the fetal red blood cells in the
[SPEAKER_00]: unborn baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why it's important to be able
to understand blood types of both mother
[SPEAKER_00]: and father and what the potential will be
for the offspring and what order that
[SPEAKER_00]: child is and the risk factor that may
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we have ways of preventing this
from happening, but it's important to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to recognize the situations this
could occur so preventive measures can be taken.
