[SPEAKER_00]: This DeBacco University video is going to
look at calcium and magnesium,
[SPEAKER_00]: its importance in plants, and these are
nutrients typically reported in a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: test report, so you should have some
understanding of how they impact plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we'll look at calcium and
magnesium importance in a soil test
[SPEAKER_00]: report.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we notice that it's often marketed
here as bone health for humans,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's also calcium and magnesium are
also important.
[SPEAKER_00]: for a plant's health as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, starting with calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for calcium it's a vital component of
the cell manufacturing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium also improves the root uptake of
other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants growing points are particularly
sensitive to an insufficient calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: supply as evident by blossom end rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those black sunken spots often discovered
at the bottom of tomatoes and summer
[SPEAKER_00]: squash here indicate that these plants
were not getting adequate levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, lack of moisture can contribute to
this disorder, and soils that are properly
[SPEAKER_00]: limed generally contain adequate calcium
levels because this nutrient is a major
[SPEAKER_00]: constitute of limestone.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you're dependent on that lime
for your calcium, be aware that some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that calcium, while in high amounts,
may not be necessarily always plant
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can occur in other crops as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see the grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we're talking about crops that
don't produce an actual fruit,
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is looking at the actively
growing points, typically you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: see calcium issues at kind of the tips of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the browning or the burning of the
tips of plants can be another indication
[SPEAKER_00]: that your plants might be deficient in
calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going on to magnesium here, and magnesium
is a key element in the development of
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnesium, abbreviated Mg, is a crucial
for seed formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like calcium, magnesium is usually
supplied by liming materials, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: dolomitic lime, because dolomitic
limestone contains about 20% magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only are you getting a pH change,
making your soil that might be too acidic
[SPEAKER_00]: more basic, you're also getting magnesium
with that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epsom salts or magnesium sulfate may be
recommended where calcium and soil pH
[SPEAKER_00]: levels are adequate, but soil magnesium is
still low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when I say flex chlorophyll
development, we can see here that the
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow weight the yellow coloration of the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it's a tomato, but look very similar
in other crops for the magnesium
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of very characteristic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it not be every leaf,
but we can see it's definitely evident
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main veins of the leaf are still
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the in-between veins, the interveinal
areas is what yellows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a classic symbol of a magnesium
deficiency, particularly if it occurs on
[SPEAKER_00]: the older or the lower leaves within a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be an indication that you may be
looking at a plant here that is magnesium deficient.
