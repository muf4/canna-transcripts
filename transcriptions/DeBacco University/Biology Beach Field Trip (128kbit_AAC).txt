[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to go over some details
about the biology field trip to Hammond
[SPEAKER_00]: Asset Beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go over some of the basic
structure of the field trip and also some
[SPEAKER_00]: questions you should be asking yourself
and looking at answering coming away from
[SPEAKER_00]: this field trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first part is it is Hammond Asset
State Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the address.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be parking in the main
parking lot here, walking down this large
[SPEAKER_00]: walkway to the main pavilion and
continuing out from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hammond Asset State Park is Connecticut's
largest shoreline park with over two miles
[SPEAKER_00]: of beach to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't be visiting all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be focusing mainly from here
starting, working to sand dunes and
[SPEAKER_00]: working basically over to this area here
in the loop region.
[SPEAKER_00]: It first opened to the public in July 18,
1920.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was used as an army reservation on the
federal government during World War II,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it does have some historic reference,
and over one million people visit every
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully we can enjoy it and be able
to understand some of the impacts of this
[SPEAKER_00]: area with just that volume of people that
visit the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just some quick words of caution just
to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please carry out what you carry in,
regardless of what that is related to food
[SPEAKER_00]: or anything else that you bring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be respectful of others in the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be other school groups there,
even amongst your own students and other
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals from the public that may be
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep a watch out for everyone in
our group and also other groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, just make sure you watch out for
poison ivy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to point it out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically we'll have green leaves,
but when it first comes out, it may have
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of reddish tones here,
and that's some anthocyanin that's
[SPEAKER_00]: produced in the leaves to help protect it
from the sun, help shade it there a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, not something you want to be
touching as it can cause a severe
[SPEAKER_00]: itchiness and allergic reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now getting to the key ideas of the field
trip to keep in mind, you want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: considerate of how the individual species
and ecosystem respond as the oceans become
[SPEAKER_00]: more acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly a trend that we are noticing here
with some general global data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, why will rising water temperature
impact the beach?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how will that affect and what will
affect?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are native invasive species
interacting with one another?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you find any of native or invasives?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the role that each species
environment play in the carbon cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the general theme we're going to be
looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also what can we do to help mitigate
negative impacts?
[SPEAKER_00]: So general organization, I'm going to go
through these in a little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you just an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we say beach, just think of sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some rocky areas, there are some
areas that have trees and there's trails.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be visiting a little bit of each of
these major different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some of the key questions to
ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sand dunes, art and science, water
testing, plants, animals, and salt
[SPEAKER_00]: marshes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just going to give you a quick overview of
these stations here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the sand dunes, the importance of
sand dunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how do sand dunes impact the local
environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you define four unique niches found
within the zones of the sandy beach area?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the connection between the sand
dunes and hurricanes?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they protect the beach?
[SPEAKER_00]: How could they, if they become damaged,
how could that be a threat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Things, again, three key questions to
consider when looking at sand dunes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to blending art and science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how does art and science fuse
together?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what made you select a story or
drawing that you created at this station?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just have some supporting reasons for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water testing station, can you identify
the type of the tests that were performed?
[SPEAKER_00]: What were the results?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the data found or what was the
data provided to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this provide information in the
area that can not simply be seen in an
[SPEAKER_00]: image?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I have a picture here of the
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it at Hammond Asset Beach?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the data say?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the result of the testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some key points to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the pH scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven is neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under seven is considered acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over seven is considered basic on our
chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero to 14 is the scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Browenthyl blue solution may have used
this in a lab of looking at respiration
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a pH indicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And carbon dioxide in water will result in
carbonic acid formation, reducing the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants living at the beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some plants that are able to
survive in the beach environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're walking on a trail, look for a
tag number four next to a large rock and a
[SPEAKER_00]: bench.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are there different colored algae?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here of a rock with some green,
some brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are these different colors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do they exist?
[SPEAKER_00]: And consider the question, a plant at the
beach may have genetics to grow 10 feet
[SPEAKER_00]: tall, but at maturity, the phenotype's
only three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: What stress is maybe on the plant so it
does not reach its full genetic potential?
[SPEAKER_00]: So be thinking and considering that
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we go into the animal hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at the water's edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've been in my classroom,
you might recognize this image.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is on the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to consider what animals can you
find?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does the tide impact your ability to
find animals?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are tides?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does suffocation affect the shells and
skeletons of sea life?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a good link you might want to
look at here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you fully classify one animal,
starting with the domain, the kingdom,
[SPEAKER_00]: then go into phylum, class, order,
family, genus, and species for just one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the animals that you are, or someone is
able to find at the beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: The value of salt marshes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are salt marshes important?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do not have salt marshes,
what would be the negative impacts in the
[SPEAKER_00]: local ecosystem?
[SPEAKER_00]: From a bird's perspective, identify at
least four reasons why salt marshes are
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's, again, images from human-acid
beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, those resounding questions we want
to be thinking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: How will individual species and ecosystems
respond as oceans become more acidic?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is ocean acidification?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some ways individual species
might respond to ocean acidification?
[SPEAKER_00]: How will the lowering of ocean's water's
pH impact the ability of ocean to store
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon in deep sea sediments?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can be done to reduce this change?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, things we want to be considering as
overarching themes amongst all stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, why will rising water
temperature impact the beach?
[SPEAKER_00]: How will this impact current species in
place and the potential spread of invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: species?
[SPEAKER_00]: What impact does warmer surface
temperature have on ocean storms?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can be done to reduce the negative
impacts?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, a good link here and some data
provided with you on this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, how are native invasive species
interacting?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is an invasive species defined?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can be the long-term impacts of
invasive species?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some examples of native invasive
species found at the beach?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, a great link here to the
Connecticut website.
[SPEAKER_00]: The role of species environment play in
the carbon cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can give you a brief overview here
of the carbon cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cycling carbon involves a few
different forms of carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what roles carbon dioxide play in
the carbon cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at that molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that interact with plants and
animals?
[SPEAKER_00]: What role do plants and animals play in
this cycle as well, as well as human
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts and results of fossil fuel
burning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we want to kind of end this on a
positive note.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do to help?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look in the mirror, can we be
proud?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some activities that can
contribute to the acidification of oceans?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be mindful of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What actions can we do to reduce the
negative impacts on the environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some good information provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very lastly, in no particular order,
some quality resources that might help you
[SPEAKER_00]: address some of these questions and also
provide some great background on the
[SPEAKER_00]: beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just kind of that overview of
the biology field trip to Hammond Asset
[SPEAKER_00]: Beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the description, there is the link to
all the images that I used, as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: slides if you want to print those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you have a fun time and are able to
learn something and make a connection to
[SPEAKER_00]: the study of life.
Thank you.
