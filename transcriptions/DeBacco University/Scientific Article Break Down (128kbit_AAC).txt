[SPEAKER_00]: And when you first look at a scientific
article, it may seem like a daunting task
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to make any sense of what's going
on with its small font and two-column
[SPEAKER_00]: format.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to break down what a
scientific article contains so you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciation for the power that is present
in a very typically a very small amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: space here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I'll start with the title.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps determine if an article is of
interest to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically provides a reasonable complete
description of the study that was
[SPEAKER_00]: conducted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the title should be included the
species that were studied, the kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments performed, and at times a
brief indication of the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just reading that title is a good first
step, but don't just completely be
[SPEAKER_00]: dissuaded by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to go on to another very
important part of a scientific article.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the abstract.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very succinct summary,
very straight to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing an example of one right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like the teaser, gives you just
kind of a brief overview of what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on, but something that really is very
pointed at summarizing the article to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you if you do want to explore it any
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, you would go on to the
introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This contains background information of
the author's hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This introduction also usually describes a
theoretical background, indicates why the
[SPEAKER_00]: work is important, states a specific
research question, and poses a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesis to be tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they usually don't start with once
upon a time, but it's kind of getting into
[SPEAKER_00]: that introduction, that background
information of the author's hypothesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of making these connections here to
what the main point of this article is
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This leads to the methods, and this
describes exactly how the author's
[SPEAKER_00]: performed the experiment in a way so that
it can be recreated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good thing about this is kind of like
ingredients included as part of a recipe
[SPEAKER_00]: to make something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it repeatable?
[SPEAKER_00]: It describes exactly the process you
should go through, and every time you
[SPEAKER_00]: follow that, you should get the same end
result.
[SPEAKER_00]: The methods describe the experimental
design.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often skipped, so a lot of people say
you don't have to really read the methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very important to read the
methods section, as this can tell you if
[SPEAKER_00]: there are inaccuracies with the procedure,
which can dramatically impact the validity
[SPEAKER_00]: of the findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether or not you trust the end result
is going to depend or hinge a lot on the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual methods that those scientists chose
to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you follow the methods and they
don't make a lot of sense, well then you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't really hold a lot of weight with
their end results.
[SPEAKER_00]: The results section will be following
this, and this contains the data collected
[SPEAKER_00]: during the experimentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much of the important information included
in the sections in tables, graphs,
[SPEAKER_00]: are often included here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people just look at the tables
and graphs, which you also want to read
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the background and especially the
captions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reader can analyze the raw data and
draw their own conclusion, which is why
[SPEAKER_00]: reading the previous method section is so
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just look at the results but have
no idea how they went about collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: those results, it can really impact
whether your degree of trust or comfort
[SPEAKER_00]: with accepting those results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the discussion phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this section I should say, this
explains the author's interpret of the
[SPEAKER_00]: data and how it connects to their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Authors often use discussions to describe
what their work suggests and how it
[SPEAKER_00]: relates to other studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that conversation that's
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, while it is a written text,
you kind of have a net conversation about
[SPEAKER_00]: what the results show and how it may
connect to other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, we have the literature cited,
and that's all the sources that are cited
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good idea to look over this section
to see what sources were used and how the
[SPEAKER_00]: dates compared to the published date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a large gap between them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are many relatively close?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of topic is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: All things worth consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This section is also helpful for
generating a list of background reading on
[SPEAKER_00]: the topic that's under study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can give you a lot of kind of one book
may lead to another and may lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: another article to really assimilate kind
of this mass of information so you're able
[SPEAKER_00]: to understand the bigger picture rather
than just the single topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this kind of clarified a
scientific article, breaks it down a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more and makes it less
intimidating so you can try to research
[SPEAKER_00]: one, find one that's of interest to you,
and be able to understand it and
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate the work that went into its
creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
