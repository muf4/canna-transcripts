[SPEAKER_00]: In general, genetics are becoming very
popular and the same is holding true for
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you ever wonder what a cannabis breeder
actually does?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this Tobacco University video will
go over some of the day-to-day activities
[SPEAKER_00]: and qualifications if you're considering
pursuing this as a career.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's take a look at a cannabis
breeder in action here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what's the basic job
description of a cannabis breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're responsible for breeding
plants to purify and strengthen strains
[SPEAKER_00]: and often can combine strains or enhance
specific characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those could be cannabinoids,
those could be terpene profiles,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can be looking at vegetative
propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can be looking at starting from seeds
and pollen transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all involved in the breeding
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, their day-to-day activities just
in general are often looking at studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetic code of the plants,
create new plant varieties, eliminate
[SPEAKER_00]: unwanted traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be as important as creating
new varieties as eliminating unwanted
[SPEAKER_00]: traits, something that's deemed not
desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Develop breeding schedules, maintain a
budget and timelines, and utilize
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate technologies as far as where
they're fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also add kind of, as you can see here,
the level of organization and attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: detail are also important qualities for
that person to have, as we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: presented right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other qualities that person should have is
usually a bachelor's degree in crop
[SPEAKER_00]: science or agronomy, which is the study of
field crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, a master's or PhD may be
required and that can depend, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the facility you're choosing to apply
to or work at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experience working in a lab is definitely
very helpful as far as learning some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the laboratory techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ability to work with appropriate lab
equipment and understanding that
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good communication skills, ability to
focus and willingness to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of where we see those
breeding strategies of developing those
[SPEAKER_00]: F1, those F2 parental strains,
developing those new varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to screen out the ones that
aren't performing well, all viable
[SPEAKER_00]: important qualities this breeder must
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the connection to cannabis just in
general is that cannabis breeders pioneer
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry by creating new cultivars and
strains, breeding for certain aspects from
[SPEAKER_00]: within the plant or in different isolated
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're constantly pushing the boundaries
of what is possible in regards to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid and terpene content with new
developed cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And breeders can experiment with new
combinations of terpenes to achieve
[SPEAKER_00]: desired results in that plant and
ultimately in that end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is some great things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing a lot of great advancement
and gets into the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understanding those can really be a great
way to produce new plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at other breeding aspects,
such as animals or other crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of that applies to cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you like that kind of work,
that kind of industry work, this can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: great job opportunity for you to consider.
