[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to look at visual trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluation to determine peak harvest time,
utilizing images from students in my
[SPEAKER_00]: class, as we can see located right here,
to try to investigate trichomes and give a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower viewpoint so you can best relate it
to potentially something that you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to see yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into looking into
everyone's favorite structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, well, why should we even
look at the trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, remember, trichomes provide an
indication of the plant's ripeness and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid and terpene concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visual evaluations, which we provided
here, may not provide the exact number,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it can indicate when the greatest
concentrations of these compounds are
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to occur in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plant sample chemically analyzes the
best method in providing with a
[SPEAKER_00]: certificate of analysis, though this is a
time-consuming and costly, so out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: reach for most growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the visual inspection can get very
close to peak harvest with minimal cost,
[SPEAKER_00]: helping growers maximize production,
can also help growers utilizing the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical analysis for when they should
sample their plants to be submitted for
[SPEAKER_00]: their certificate of analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got our different trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bulbous ones are the smallest ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really need an aid to be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we can kind of make them out here and
a little bit here, but they're very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult because of their size to be
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can synthesize cannabinoids and
terpenes, so just because they're small
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't mean they're not contributing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can swell in size once they fill with
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sessile ones are the larger than the
bulbous ones, but still hard to see with
[SPEAKER_00]: the naked eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: They develop early, about three-week-old
plants or so, so they can be seen quite
[SPEAKER_00]: early.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the stalked glandular capitate
trichomes are the ones most growers are
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the large ones, and they can be
seen with the naked eye, and they're the
[SPEAKER_00]: prized trichomes that appear during
flowering, but they are also, because of
[SPEAKER_00]: their stalked nature, most likely to get
damaged as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we actually looking at when we
look at their trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, an individual inflorescence here
with majority of the organs covered with
[SPEAKER_00]: stalked glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The arrow right here indicates the cluster
of calyces and bracts covered with those
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: B is looking at a dark field micrograph of
stalked glandular trichomes protruding
[SPEAKER_00]: from the calyx of the epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites
occurs in the secretory disc cells lining
[SPEAKER_00]: the base of the globular trichome head,
and the metabolites are stored in the
[SPEAKER_00]: clear portion here at the top here,
and they will turn milky white to brown
[SPEAKER_00]: over the course of the flower maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which we'll see in the images coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The graphic illustration here of the
stalked trichome structure giving some
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of kind of the locations of different
cells and differentiated cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say, within that stalked
trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at the color differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are distinctive, cleared,
cloudy, and amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clear, you can think of it as being
quote-unquote empty and basically not
[SPEAKER_00]: ready for harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see right through it,
quote, there's nothing in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get the cloudy ones, and those are
increased levels of cannabinoids as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the amber ones are converting in this
stage desirable compounds into maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: changing to less desirable compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically becoming a little bit quote over
ripe in some cases there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really looking for this cloudy to
amber kind of range there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so can we use the pistols?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're going to talk focus on the
trichomes, but can we look at the pistols?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, pistols can provide a quick guide,
but this is really the trichomes where the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and terpenes are stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the plant part that should be
absorbed with the attention to detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically recommend to use the pistols as
kind of just a quick indication,
[SPEAKER_00]: quick way to kind of look at the flowers
as you're going down a row or looking at a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, but really kind of drives the,
oh, wait, those look a little more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: amber color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me now look at the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be a little bit variety and
genotype dependent, but the pistols can be
[SPEAKER_00]: used as an indication, but we really want
to use the trichomes as the final
[SPEAKER_00]: determination of whether we should be
harvesting something or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, pistols located here,
trichomes are those clear, white
[SPEAKER_00]: structures located right next to the leaf
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the traditional method, of course,
is use a loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works great and still recommended,
but it can be hard to really share what's
[SPEAKER_00]: seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really hard for me to kind
of have a loop look at something and then
[SPEAKER_00]: can I give the loop to someone else and
have them look at it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of you've got to develop the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get really up close and
personal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little getting used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there is something called the
Maxi camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not sponsored by them in any ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: A student had brought one of these in and
we utilized it in class and you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: some images from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a compact handheld camera microscope
that can connect an electronic device,
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing you to live to kind of see what's
going on and to capture those images.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are actual images from class I
teach at the University of Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were taken of the abacus plants from
class in weeks six to eight of flower with
[SPEAKER_00]: the help of a student's Maxi camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks goes out to Erin for the use of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could be able to capture some of
these images you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a macroscopic look of what one of
the buds looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're going to take a little bit
more of that zoomed in version there of
[SPEAKER_00]: the trichome structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the pistols that I just
talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we don't want to use them for
indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can contain trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are still some trichomes that
have developed on the pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not the ones really to focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all trichomes contain the desirable
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amber brown color of the pistol here
is an indication at this point that this
[SPEAKER_00]: flower is nearing harvest time,
but is the inspection of the trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: that really makes the final decision on
when to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see kind of mostly clear
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So close but not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stocked capitate trichomes can be
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, most are clear, indicating that
it's too early to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some initial kind of cloudy
trichomes, but overall population must be
[SPEAKER_00]: taken into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them are clear in nature
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little too early, but good to start
looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the previously clear are basically now
turning cloudy, as we can see that right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This indicates an increase in the amount
of cannabinoids the plant is producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're nearing that point of harvest
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of an exciting time,
a good time to kind of prepare the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: for that final area there, that final
harvest that's coming very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now note, I've put some purple arrow
highlights that some are having these
[SPEAKER_00]: purple colorations to the stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is mainly genetics that cause
this and not environmental factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is possible for the grower to
enhance the color based on various plant
[SPEAKER_00]: stressors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature, light spectrum, and light
intensity are a couple of those that can
[SPEAKER_00]: enhance this, but really has to come from
the genetics, at least initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some are more apt to produce more
purple coloration than some other
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is mainly abacus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those purple concentrations,
again, you can see on the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: macroscopically.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as kind of almost microscopically
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a sign of anthocyanin production.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a water soluble pigment in a
larger class of compounds known as
[SPEAKER_00]: flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a major category.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a subset of that category.
[SPEAKER_00]: While anecdotal, some people have reported
better symptom relief in the presence of
[SPEAKER_00]: anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at different varieties
and you kind of see some of that purple
[SPEAKER_00]: coloration, anthocyanins might be
something you want to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a certificate of analysis report.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now peak cloudiness, as we kind of see
here, this would be the earliest
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically the goal is to see a few
ambers before harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a sign that we're just almost
quite there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see, again, that high
concentration of those cloudy trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that camera does a really good job
of really zooming in and allowing you to
[SPEAKER_00]: see what I can see through a loop,
but to convey it to you here on an image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly here, these are the first
ambers being seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be the harvest point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that here and here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this really indicates that probably
this would be the best time or the optimum
[SPEAKER_00]: time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you just start needing to first go in
amber, if you're starting with a new
[SPEAKER_00]: variety, go ahead and harvest at this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can harvest some a little earlier,
a little bit later, and obtain what
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may indicate your exact time of
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for a general
recommendation, you see a first couple
[SPEAKER_00]: start to turn amber, harvest it,
and use that as your gauge point going
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this helped you with some real
world images to see trichome development,
[SPEAKER_00]: share with you with some of the students
had grown, and hope you appreciated those
[SPEAKER_00]: images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
