[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at comparing
coevolution and co-adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this image here of this flower
selecting for a very specific pollinator,
[SPEAKER_00]: or in this case an insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are these kind of co-adapting
together to allow this perfect match to
[SPEAKER_00]: occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: This flower, for whatever reason,
may want only this particular type of
[SPEAKER_00]: insect to carry its pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's occurring between these two
species to allow this very high degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: specificity?
[SPEAKER_00]: So coevolution is a term that describes
the long-term evolutionary adjustments of
[SPEAKER_00]: a species to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: This coevolution is two or more species
that exert selective pressures on each
[SPEAKER_00]: other and evolve in response to each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a private example of that here,
where these flowers are of a very small
[SPEAKER_00]: diameter and are very long, which matches
up perfectly with the hummingbird's long
[SPEAKER_00]: beak.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bee would not be a great pollinator for
this, but this flower is designing its
[SPEAKER_00]: structures to particularly match that of
the hummingbird, allowing this coevolution
[SPEAKER_00]: to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because each species is evolving in
response to the other, one important
[SPEAKER_00]: feature of coevolution is that the
selective environment is constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: changing to allow this to occur over a
long period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do we study coevolution?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll coevolution study many levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adaptations of the individuals,
interactions between species, and also
[SPEAKER_00]: broad evolutionary patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coadaptation is the reciprocal adaptations
of two species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could refer to species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could also refer to adaptations
possessed by individuals and or their
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at an example of
coadaptation, we have caterpillars that
[SPEAKER_00]: are secreting honeydew for ants to drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why would they do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, ants will go out of their way to
defend caterpillars against parasitic
[SPEAKER_00]: wasps, which can kill the caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the honeydew's secretion in defense are
coadaptations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The honeydew that is supplied to the ants
by the caterpillars will allow or provide
[SPEAKER_00]: the caterpillars with physical protection
from the ants from parasitic wasps that
[SPEAKER_00]: can lay an egg and literally cause the
caterpillar to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of a coadaptation
that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does coadaptation demonstrate
coevolution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, biologists often have a strict
definition for coevolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's evidence of parallel evolution
between taxa, which is referring to a
[SPEAKER_00]: broad definition or classification is
required.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does coadaptation demonstrate
coevolution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Adaptation is in the short term and
evolution is over the long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have different animal species
exhibiting different wings for flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does coadaptation demonstrate
coevolution?
