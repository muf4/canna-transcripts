[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to be providing a little
background on Pythium, also known as
[SPEAKER_00]: damping off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with the picture here on the title
slide, this is a disease that particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: attacks the roots or the root structure of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to be able to find a way
to inspect those if you suspect that your
[SPEAKER_00]: crop is infected with Pythium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's different species of Pythium,
but they all have similar preferred
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very common in younger plants or
seedlings, as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can reduce the germination rate when
using seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's kind of unique about this
disease is while we have an entire flat
[SPEAKER_00]: here of plants growing, you can see
Pythium will affect certain areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may not be widespread and infect all
plants, but it may occur in small pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you find a pocket here where plants
have become infected, and you look closer
[SPEAKER_00]: at those seedlings, typically if you look
at the base, the stem and soil point of
[SPEAKER_00]: intersection is where you'll see this kind
of browning and discoloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can include plants that are wilting,
may have a yellow coloration to their
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, and the key part here is to,
if you see that in a plant, especially a
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling, inspect the soil line to see if
you see conditions that look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, above the soil might be perfectly
green, but at that soil line will
[SPEAKER_00]: typically be where you find that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this disease is very rarely found in
soilless mixes, but can be easily
[SPEAKER_00]: unintentionally inoculated by growers
using either dirty tools from an infected
[SPEAKER_00]: area or reusing some soil or having very
cool temperatures in their seedling flats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now again, where to look, it's encouraged
by overwatering and poor drainage,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you want to look at that soil line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root tips are often brown and dead,
resulting in stunted plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This brown tissue on the outer portion of
the root easily pulls off, leaving a
[SPEAKER_00]: strand of vascular tissue exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do see this, you do go
physically, kind of rub your fingers
[SPEAKER_00]: around this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically that very outer coating will
come off very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you're looking at a quick
inspection, look right at that soil line.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see that brown ring, that's an
indication you could have pythium or
[SPEAKER_00]: damping off.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping tools and containers clean and
sterile is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can control fungus in that larvae as
these can aid in the spread of pythium,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where controlling an insect can
help prevent a disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: For flood and drain setups, a strain
filter is recommended to prevent media
[SPEAKER_00]: from flowing into the reservoir,
which can carry the disease that way and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of inoculate, sadly, your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conditions that favor pythium are high
salts over watering in wet weather
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we may have control over all of those,
keeping in mind that these are areas that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can look at on records and
documentation you may be doing to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're kind of falling into one of these
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have fast drying growing media,
that may be a way to discourage the
[SPEAKER_00]: formation of pythium and a way for you to
prevent it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see again in this image here where
we're seeing that kind of initial area
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of spreading out but not affecting
all plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see pythium infected roots
compared to what normal or healthy roots
[SPEAKER_00]: should look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see definitely is that
reduction in total root area, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: also going to affect the above ground
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to control it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's difficult to control once it's
established.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure irrigation water is clean in the
sense it's disease free.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is particularly important for using
recirculated water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungicides can be an option, but use them
with caution and follow labeled
[SPEAKER_00]: instructions and they may not offer a
great level of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here with point cities where one area
is infected and other plants are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, you may want to remove these
plants and definitely ensure that the
[SPEAKER_00]: water from these plants is not going
through and infecting the entire crop in
[SPEAKER_00]: this grow facility.
Thank you.
