[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here I'm going to talk about the
cannabis cup because this is often
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned quite a bit, and you might see
seeds or cultivars labeled cannabis cup
[SPEAKER_00]: winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I should describe a little
bit about what this is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, within the cannabis cup,
there might be many out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but kind of the high times cannabis cup is
the one that's kind of regarded as the
[SPEAKER_00]: most widely accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has categories, rules, regulations,
and everything I present here is based on
[SPEAKER_00]: the 2017 competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be some changes, so use this as
a point in time reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go through and find them,
this is a direct link to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if any competition should know
the rules, this is from 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why the high times cannabis cup?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a large and well-established
event that has set some of the standards
[SPEAKER_00]: for judging and competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I chose to focus on this one in
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: As with any competition, there are rules
established, but there are also some
[SPEAKER_00]: potential concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've attempted to provide some opinions
and potential shortcomings of the rules
[SPEAKER_00]: that are presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the official rules, the important
notes, all judging for high times cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cup is conducted by doctor prescribed and
state licensed medical marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Entries are collected and distributed
under the legal frameworks of each state's
[SPEAKER_00]: legal medical or recreational cannabis
program or guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's their official kind of stated
rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a general statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do hold the human element as a
judging system, as a variable component in
[SPEAKER_00]: the process, even so they're a measurable
science component.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they typically have a qualitative and
quantitative, depending on what category,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they want to have that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the driver experience with also
that kind of lab-based kind of results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the qualitative side of the scoring
sheet counts for about 70%, while the
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative side accounts for about 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, percentages may vary by
category, but that 30% is that
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative is more that scientific lab
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Qualitative is more that human experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So general categories are listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: For each category, a summary of the
category and description will be
[SPEAKER_00]: presented, followed by my comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same format will be used for judging
and scoring information sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at the flower
category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to bore and go through
all the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pause the video and read those for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this flower category, we limit to
the sativa indicated flower entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right there, this is the part where
the use of sativa in indicating indica
[SPEAKER_00]: categories continues to exist and be used
as criteria to be defined, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: they're only morphological differences,
not actual chemical differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of is part of just continuing
that kind of debate and that separation,
[SPEAKER_00]: or that thought of separation between
indica and sativas when there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific basis for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The judging and scoring for flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use of lab tests focuses on the actual
content of THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, tripping levels can impact the
taste and profile, kind of like a fine
[SPEAKER_00]: wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, since this is the actual plant
product, how it physically looks is taken
[SPEAKER_00]: into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, again, it's that lab component,
that human experience, and also that
[SPEAKER_00]: visual effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrates and non-solvent hash is a
category.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, again, shows the difficulty to
change the community to use the term
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using a lot of like, you know,
you can see the terms of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: strains and, you know, varieties and not
necessarily cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get away from these categories of
category classifications that may be
[SPEAKER_00]: established but lack scientific support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because it's constantly said,
oh, indicas and sativas, this is,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, not showing a strong scientific
basis for that, even though it's commonly
[SPEAKER_00]: established in the industry to the current
point in time, at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the judging, the use of lab tests
focuses on, again, the actual THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, those terpene profiles can affect
the taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is similar to the flower category,
but since hash has been processed,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has a certain expected visual
appearance for that consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, edibles is a category.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be a very broad category.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes into account the actual product,
but also the packaging is part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: scoring criteria, which makes blind
judging not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: When producing a product, the packaging is
also very important, and this category
[SPEAKER_00]: addresses the need for quality product and
also quality advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: The judging shows a very diverse
marketplace here and lack of consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: One main flaw is that product labels and
packaging are simply graded on this
[SPEAKER_00]: criteria category as being present and are
not actually checked or verified.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is stated on the package matches the
test results, so that's a major issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: because this can be misleading and this
concept to the consumer that what is on
[SPEAKER_00]: the label actually represents what's in
the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this misconception is kind of like,
oh, it's on the label, it's got to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: the product, not necessarily verified,
at least in this case for the edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD entries, so this demonstrates that
there's more than just percentage of CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: at play when selecting a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also getting into the looking at of not
relying solely on those lab results in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past that they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've demonstrated it's just more than
CBD at play, there's more to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this does add a variable to the
category, and that can cause a different
[SPEAKER_00]: rating system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, hard to find what the exact
definition is for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the judging, adding the human and
lab results speaks to the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: the experience or that kind of relates to
the terpene level as much as the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of CBD that is produced in that final
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the vape pen category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is part of a larger challenge is
the ease of use of such devices in
[SPEAKER_00]: flavoring additives, indicating the focus
on recreation and less on medical value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, while this can be a great way
for a very easy way, it can almost be a
[SPEAKER_00]: way that's too easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was newly established in 2016,
indicating its popularity, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavoring additives kind of get that focus
more on that recreation and less on the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we look at the judging and the
scoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: An issue is that extra points are awarded
to a vape pen that's more stealthier,
[SPEAKER_00]: further driving the manufacturing to
produce something that can be hidden,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if there's exponential uses of these
style products by underage individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of favors that concealing is
only driving that potential use by
[SPEAKER_00]: underage users.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can be an issue that they're
rewarding companies for making a better
[SPEAKER_00]: concealed product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's nice to see that adding
ingredients, directions, and warning
[SPEAKER_00]: labels get bonus points and are not a
requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this kind of speaks to,
in all honesty, the shadiness of this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular category.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the reason why it's such a bad
rap is because of these particular reasons
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Topicals are becoming increasingly
popular, which justifies their recent
[SPEAKER_00]: inclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: For pain relief, in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: The judging of this category, a
cannabinoid infused topical is required to
[SPEAKER_00]: participate, but keep in mind that the
level or concentration is not a
[SPEAKER_00]: classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a user, you need to keep the total
amount of product contains as a
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: All topicals must contain X amount of
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just important to keep that in
mind with the various cannabinoid infused
[SPEAKER_00]: products that are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The judging process.
[SPEAKER_00]: High Times is a scoring system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a scorecard that gets placed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It employs two-tier digital and online and
score sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scorebook includes qualitative and
quantitative scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each entry score averages will then be
added to correlated with the lab results
[SPEAKER_00]: by the uploaded data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This system then combines the judges'
averages of the qualitative score with the
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative lab score, giving a final
total of a possible 100 points.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Canvas Club closing judging statement
at High Times strives to create the most
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate comprehensive scoring system in
the Canvas industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your participation and feedback as
competitor is integral to the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope you're proud to be a part of the
process, and we thank you for your support
[SPEAKER_00]: and patience as we continually evolve the
system into the world's ultimate Canvas
[SPEAKER_00]: scoring index.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do give indications that they are
willing to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is just looking at 2017 as a
point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely areas, I think, for
improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we get more people on board here,
I think we can start to see some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flaws, and High Times seems that they're
striving for that accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is that potential for change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, Canvas Cup winners are in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a high honor, and it's something
that is a mark of excellence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calls of Hours are often regarded as blank
years, Canvas Cup winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the 2010 Canvas Cup winner,
the 2016 Canvas Cup winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see that a lot of the times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to go back to the rules
and see what that actually means,
[SPEAKER_00]: what they actually have to do to qualify
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more to understand some degree,
what's the grading system, and to this
[SPEAKER_00]: label, so you can have a meaning of what
it means making a comparison between two
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because something's a Canvas Cup
winner shouldn't be regarded as a blanket
[SPEAKER_00]: statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look back and see what some of the
requirements are for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the year it may have won,
if you could find those rules for that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular year, all the better.
