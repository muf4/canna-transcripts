[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're going to look at osteoporosis
and some other bone abnormalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in general, looking at some of these
abnormalities, we're looking at weakening
[SPEAKER_00]: of bone structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, we have a normal individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the width of the trabeculae here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be considered normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sadly, in this individual,
we have a much thinner trabeculae here,
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating these bones are more likely to
be fractured or broken than the individual
[SPEAKER_00]: here, which we're considering to have a
normal amount of bone damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these homeostatic imbalances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Osteomylage is one of these conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where bones are inadequately
mineralized, causing softened and or
[SPEAKER_00]: weakened bones to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that evident here in this x-ray.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main symptom of this is pain when
weight is put on the affected bone,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we have these kind of inadequate
mineralizations, these kind of small
[SPEAKER_00]: fractures that may be occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can cause pain to the individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: What causes this is insufficient calcium
in the diet or by vitamin D deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, insufficient calcium in the diet
could mean that the individual is just not
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming enough calcium, or the calcium
the individual is consuming is not
[SPEAKER_00]: bioavailable to the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not able to be broken down and used
in the bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ricketts is an extreme case of this,
and this occurs in children, where bones
[SPEAKER_00]: of children are inadequately mineralized,
causing softened and weakened bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bowed legs and deformities in the pelvis,
skull, and ribcage are common with those
[SPEAKER_00]: affected by rickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's caused by the same things we talked
about earlier, the insufficient calcium in
[SPEAKER_00]: the diet or by vitamin D deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, insufficient calcium could be
just the total amount of calcium or the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of bioavailable calcium in the
diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Osteoporosis, you might be familiar with
or heard of before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a group of diseases in
which bone reabsorption outpaces bone
[SPEAKER_00]: deposits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, bone is constantly being broken
down and repaired.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's being broken down at a
greater rate than it's being repaired at.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be about equal, and to
maintain a normal bone here, here we have
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly an excessive osteoclast activity,
excessive amount of bone being broken
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the normal bone, remember, the
osteoblast and osteoclast activities are
[SPEAKER_00]: both equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rate of breaking down is equal to the
rate of rebuilding.
[SPEAKER_00]: In osteoporosis specifically, spongy bone
of the spine is most vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This occurs most often in postmenopausal
women because of a change in hormones,
[SPEAKER_00]: and bones become so fragile that sneezing
or stepping off a curb can cause
[SPEAKER_00]: fractures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, in extreme cases, even everyday
activities can cause bones to be fractured
[SPEAKER_00]: or broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Osteoporosis, a single gene that encodes
for vitamin D deficiency, blocking
[SPEAKER_00]: determines the tendency to accumulate bone
mass early in life, and also the risk for
[SPEAKER_00]: osteoporosis later in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a nice graph here of the years and
age of an individual and the bone mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bone mass is measured in the total mass of
skeleton, calcium, and grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a very young age, we see a dramatic
increase in both males and females,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we start to see a separation occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The peak bone mass in males occurs right
around the same age for females,
[SPEAKER_00]: at 25 to 30 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, males bone mass peaks at a higher
rate than females.
[SPEAKER_00]: After about age 40, we notice a decrease
in bone mass with age for both males and
[SPEAKER_00]: females, but after menopause for females,
we see a dramatic, rapid decrease in a
[SPEAKER_00]: level and often a more consistent rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why females have to be a little
bit more concerned with osteoporosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it still can occur in males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treatments for this disease is calcium and
vitamin D supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, often you see vitamin D with
calcium to help the bioavailability of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased weight-bearing exercises for
individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hormones, such as estrogen replacement
therapy, abbreviated HRT, slows bone loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural potassium creams prompts new bone
growth, so this can help reduce negative
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts of osteoporosis and also increase
bone mineral density.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important, though, to keep in mind
that these hormones and other treatments
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can be side effects associated
with these, so you have to outweigh some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the risk factors with some of the
potential benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: PSJA's disease here is a disease of bone
that causes your bones to break down too
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly, thus cause your body to replace
bone too quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this is, is it's bones breaking down
and being rebuilt at too quick of a rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, the replaced bone is very
soft and brittle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of structure to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not being made at the pace it should
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of being slapped together really
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can occur in any bone of the body,
but it's most common in the arms,
[SPEAKER_00]: legs, spine, pelvis, and the skull.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's most common actually in Caucasian
males with risk increasing with the age of
[SPEAKER_00]: that individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting part is there's really no
cure and doctors aren't really sure what
[SPEAKER_00]: causes this disease, but treatment
revolves around trying to slow the rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: decay and trying to strengthen the
existing bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we want bone that's rebuilt to
have structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an extreme case of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a much milder case, but that
rebuilding bone too quickly causes it to
[SPEAKER_00]: be soft and brittle, not the integrity
that we need to support our body with our
[SPEAKER_00]: skeletal system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Development aspects of bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the mesoderm gives rise to embryonic
mesencheneal cells, which produce
[SPEAKER_00]: membranes and cartilages that form
embryonic skeletons.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting about this is the
embryonic skeleton ossifies at a very
[SPEAKER_00]: predictable timetable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows the fetal age to easily be
determined from sonograms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if someone wasn't exactly sure of the
age of their baby through sonograms,
[SPEAKER_00]: by looking at the degree of ossification
and then determine the age of that baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: That age determination can then determine
the date of conception and potential date
[SPEAKER_00]: of birth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just an interesting way through
sonograms, a non-invasive kind of picture
[SPEAKER_00]: through this predictable timetable can
allow us to determine the age of the
[SPEAKER_00]: unborn baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: More development aspects of bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: At birth, most long bones are well
ossified.
[SPEAKER_00]: During infancy and childhood, the
epithelial plate activity is stimulated by
[SPEAKER_00]: growth hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: During puberty, testosterone and estrogens
can promote adolescent growth spurts and
[SPEAKER_00]: can cause these bones to continually
develop and ossify.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's important to remember is that by
age 25, nearly all the bones are
[SPEAKER_00]: completely ossified.
[SPEAKER_00]: In old age, bone reabsorption
predominates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that resorption of bones, that
breakdown of bones, can kind of outpace
[SPEAKER_00]: the rate at which bones are rebuilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, just to kind of put that bone
density, regardless of age, the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment an individual lives in or
participates in can impact this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, an elder person typically loses
one to two percent of bone every year,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning the breakdown is greater than the
rebuilding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, regardless of age and space,
a person suffers from about one to two
[SPEAKER_00]: percent of bone loss every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is mostly reversible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lack of gravity, that lack of
compression on the bone can reduce its
[SPEAKER_00]: density.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, astronauts will go on
treadmills that are kind of held down to
[SPEAKER_00]: help kind of create an impact,
to help pack in those bones so that they
[SPEAKER_00]: try to lose as least amount as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one to two percent of bone loss every
month is quite a bit, considering an
[SPEAKER_00]: elderly person loses that same rate about
every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage of when you go to space,
and I've never been yet, the advantage is
[SPEAKER_00]: that this is mostly reversible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one of those things where
astronauts, when they come back to Earth,
[SPEAKER_00]: need to continue to participate in these
types of trainings and exercises so they
[SPEAKER_00]: can rebuild their bone mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
