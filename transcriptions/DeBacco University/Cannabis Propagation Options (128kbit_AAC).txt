[SPEAKER_00]: All right, welcome to this Tobacco
University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be investigating cannabis
propagation options, specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing seeds to clones, giving you some
of the advantages and disadvantages of
[SPEAKER_00]: both, as well as looking at a scientific
research literature paper where they
[SPEAKER_00]: compared seeds to clones to see which one
they found was the most advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join us on this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we're looking at comparing
seeds to clones, there are two options for
[SPEAKER_00]: starting cannabis plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones are a vegetatively propagated to
produce genetic copies of the original
[SPEAKER_00]: plant tissue, typically taken from a stock
or mother female plant, which ensures
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic uniformity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds result in greater potential for
plant to plant variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, which one is better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you want to go with seeds,
as we can see down here, or do you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: go with clones and much more likely what
you see looking over in this area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's take it to the scientific
literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here in this example, they compared
seeds to clones from a 30 plant
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the details or information
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to find it is open access.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average CBG and CBC content and floral
and foliage had no significant difference
[SPEAKER_00]: with a P value greater than 0.05 from
plants grown from seeds and from cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CBC potency from seeds derived from
plants was significantly more variable,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was at a P value of 0.01.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this really mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this kind of come down to in the
end?
[SPEAKER_00]: While seeds may offer some more
variability if growing in large number of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, the average should make for little
difference in the end given for the
[SPEAKER_00]: product, given the similar growing
environments for both seeds and clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the real quick summary?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, given the same environment,
it really doesn't make a difference
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you start with seeds or clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are pros and cons to each.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may want to make other
considerations for your growing
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and your growing style to
determine which one might be a best fit
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're doing this comparison,
if you were thinking seeds, what are some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the advantages to seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, seeds can be stored and germinated
when the time is needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great advantageous
characteristic there for growers who want
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of store their seeds and then when
time's right, go through and germinate the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, starting from seeds offers many
different options because the seeds ship
[SPEAKER_00]: and store easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically, your availability of
different types of strains is much greater
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're looking at starting with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the disadvantages of
starting with seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're considering seeds,
you want to consider that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: germination equipment required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this can result in variable starting
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: If some are slow to germinate,
some are quicker to germinate,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could cause different stands in your
total grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each seed does not equal a plant,
so extras are needed to be started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to keep in mind if
you're looking at growing four from a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain strain, well, you better start
with more than four seeds because no seed
[SPEAKER_00]: has a 100% guarantee of emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the advantage of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are pros and cons to clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about you know, what's some
advantages to our clones compared to those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds we just talked about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the advantage of clones is you have
a known set of genetics because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting with a genetic copy of the
original plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also starting with a plant,
not a seed that you're hoping develops a
[SPEAKER_00]: root that opens and merges.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're starting with an actual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can help ensure an even plant
starting time for you to go through the
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of guarantee everything's
going to be kind of like on the same page
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some disadvantages to clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the disadvantage to clones is that a
large population of clones, there needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: be, there's a chance of a single disease
could wipe out the entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because they're all genetic copies,
if a disease knocks one out, it could
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially knock them all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones also lack a central tap root,
so that's an important consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: While they can have extensive roots,
they typically will lack that tap root
[SPEAKER_00]: because all those roots are coming out of
the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And care needs to be taken as of day one,
as treating these as actual plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another, you know, disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can compare it to seeds where you're
going to have that kind of slow start
[SPEAKER_00]: there, that germination process,
that little seedling and then progressing
[SPEAKER_00]: from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these are the pros and cons of
both seeds and clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You solve the scientific study,
you usually get the same result,
[SPEAKER_00]: but which one would you choose for your
grow operation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does seeds sound like a better fit or do
clones sound like a better fit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And investigate more videos on this
channel for details about each method on
[SPEAKER_00]: whichever one you think works best for
your propagation and propagation.
