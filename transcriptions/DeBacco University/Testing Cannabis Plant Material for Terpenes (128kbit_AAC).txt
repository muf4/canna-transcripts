[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tobacco University video,
we're going to be looking at testing
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry plant material for the
all-important terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers are looking at producing
unique terpene profiles because a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers are looking for very specific or
unique terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to go and study a little
bit more about the testing in this Tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into testing chemistry plant
material for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, looking at the terpenes
in general, they're not unique to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and are often responsible for the odor of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a sweet smelling, a sour
smelling, an earthy or spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some of the terpenes listed
here on this kind of displayed wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different cannabis varieties produce
unique terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which in combination with the unique
ratios of cannabinoids may determine some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the preferred medical benefits by
certain end users.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we can see kind of just kind of
summary here and kind of look through and
[SPEAKER_00]: pause the video and look at that in a
little bit more detail, which is to show
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the classifications of these
terpenes, kind of where they fall on this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of general kind of classification and
what kind of effects they may result in,
[SPEAKER_00]: where their flashpoint and boil points are
just to give you some more information and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully an organized format.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the importance of terpenes just in
general is that since terpenes are not
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, some feel they are not
important constituents of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant or product.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there is increasing evidence that
other chemicals in the plant work
[SPEAKER_00]: synergistically with the cannabinoids that
produce the therapeutic response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though the cannabinoids,
THC, CBD get a lot of the attention,
[SPEAKER_00]: these terpenes and some of them,
their profiles may have this synergistic
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there might be of greater importance
despite their varied and sometimes lower
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some evidence that shows these
effects can include lowering in
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation and regulation of blood
glucose to protection of neurons as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as gastric cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still studying and learning more
about these, but it seems like early
[SPEAKER_00]: indications that their importance is only
going to be of increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to get a good analysis
and a test of that included within the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we analyze those terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: So chemical analysis has generally been
done by Capillary GC-MS, which is gas
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatography mass spec for this complex
mixture of over 200 different terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's recent reports employing
a liquid chromatography mass spec
[SPEAKER_00]: technique with atmospheric pressure
chemical ionization, APCI, may not have
[SPEAKER_00]: been the optimum chromatography separation
efficiencies compared to Capillary GC
[SPEAKER_00]: columns.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when combined with the mixture
analysis capabilities of tandem mass spec,
[SPEAKER_00]: this may produce the results needed while
also being admirable to some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: important cannabis compounds in the same
sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some evolution in the
improvement hopefully in the analysis of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes because of their determined
importance, being able to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: the analytical report is presenting those
terpenes in the most accurate way
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the suggestion for analytical
techniques when it comes to terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this quantitative determination of
terpenes and substituent terpenes is often
[SPEAKER_00]: desired and perhaps best done by either
GC-MS or LC-MS instead of some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier reported techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is this important to understand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're a grower, you want to make
sure that your plant material is getting
[SPEAKER_00]: tested properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a consumer looking at the end
report, you want to know what techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: were used to make sure it's the most
efficient and most accurate techniques to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure you can trust results provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at, lastly, these terpene
profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often consumers will seek out specific
terpenes or profiles that may have
[SPEAKER_00]: improved relief for their particular
condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers also like to showcase their
terpene profiles and provide a selling
[SPEAKER_00]: point for the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see both consumers as well as
growers have a vested interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: analyzing, studying, and making public the
terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all comes together with a quality test.
[SPEAKER_00]: With accurate results so that consumers
can make an informed decision and growers
[SPEAKER_00]: can know what their plant is actually
producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
