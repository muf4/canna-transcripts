[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to provide you with a basic
guide on tomato seed germination and the
[SPEAKER_00]: materials you need to basically allow this
process to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the checklist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need plastic cells, growing medium,
containers, heat mat, light with a timer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and humidity dome can be advised,
depending on your particular location.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go over these in a little bit
more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the plastic cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, they're all the same area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're usually about 10 inches by 20
inches, and the higher the cell count,
[SPEAKER_00]: the smaller the plug size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're dealing with that same area
in a 512 cell tray, those are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very small cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 98 cell tray in that same 10 by 20 area,
there's going to be much larger cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 128s are the typical standard that's
used for most crops, including tomatoes
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a large operation, you may want
to consider a vacuum seeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: While they are typically around $600,
it's very efficient method because you can
[SPEAKER_00]: do about 120 flats an hour and that's
about 15,000 seeds in one hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I included a link to a YouTube video about
it and also a link to where you can look
[SPEAKER_00]: at prices for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now growing mediums, there's something
called seed starting mix, which is finer
[SPEAKER_00]: and is important for small seeds like
tomatoes for good soil and moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're up potting, going from a small
container to a larger container,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can use more traditional potting
mixes can be considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pro mix is often considered to be the
standard, but there's many different types
[SPEAKER_00]: out there for consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The containers can depend on the final
planting spot and method you choose to
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cow pots are biodegradable on the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to be planted so the rim is not
exposed to the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're starting something in a cow
pot, go plant that directly into the field
[SPEAKER_00]: and don't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plastic pots are cheap and widely
available and you would have to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant the tomato out of that if
you're going into the soil or a field
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also fabric bags that can hold
plants all season if soil is not conducive
[SPEAKER_00]: to planting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be for very small operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be for people selling plants
for end markets that want to be put on a
[SPEAKER_00]: patio or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just another option there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For tomato seed germination, after that
seedling germinates, it's going to need
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since they're starting them indoors,
that can be of concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many options and the goal is to
supply your plant light so it doesn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: too leggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people use shop lights because
they're a cheap option, but they're kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a poor selection because they need to
be kept almost touching the plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: they really don't produce a great spectrum
of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: T5 fluorescents are higher output lights
and they're a much preferred option
[SPEAKER_00]: despite their increased cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ceramic metal halides, CMHs, are a current
recommendation due to the less bulbs and
[SPEAKER_00]: improved light production over our
traditional T5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And LEDs might be the best option,
but if we're just looking at seedlings,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably not the cost, probably is not
justifiable at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever we're using, we do want to be
mindful of the light age and the life
[SPEAKER_00]: expectancy of the bulb we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though they're semi-producing
light that we can see and appears to be
[SPEAKER_00]: bright, it may not be of high plant value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Midi domes can also be considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great for the germination process to
reduce the need for watering, which may
[SPEAKER_00]: disrupt the radical as that little tiny
tomato seed starts to germinate for
[SPEAKER_00]: especially small and fragile seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also consider a misting system
depending on the production and scale to
[SPEAKER_00]: live with a fine mist, fine moisture to
the medium, and also increase the humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: in the propagation area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's good old fashioned
watering can is another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be careful that you're not disturbing
the seeds too much or you might disrupt
[SPEAKER_00]: that delicate germination process.
[SPEAKER_00]: A heat mat is a good idea to get a
thermostat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not one already included.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goals to have that soil be around 70 to
75.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, in this case, warmer is not
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything over 85 can hurt or decrease your
germination rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of that overview,
that basic process there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start seeds about six weeks before
intended planting date.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would advise germination next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trays with a high cell count are going to
have smaller area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I suggest about a 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to put it in an area where the
seeds are going to be around 70 to 75
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically that would be supplied as bottom
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using an efficient real light would be
recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
