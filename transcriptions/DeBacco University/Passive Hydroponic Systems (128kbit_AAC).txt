[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, looking at hydroponic systems,
there are some that require an air stone
[SPEAKER_00]: and air pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also some that are called
passive, and these basically use a wicking
[SPEAKER_00]: system to be able to transfer the nutrient
solution, and as a result, reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of electrical dependency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can increase the reliability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, passive, or sometimes called
simple hydroponic systems, utilize what we
[SPEAKER_00]: call capillary action through a wicking
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the two different diameters of
tubes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the smaller the diameter,
the greater the water can kind of wick,
[SPEAKER_00]: or through capillary action, move up
against the surface tension here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These wicking systems lack moving parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It literally is just a wicking water
that's moving against gravity with no need
[SPEAKER_00]: for moving parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can reduce the maintenance and also
lower the initial cost to the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: These passive systems, the nutrient
solutions are passively wicked or
[SPEAKER_00]: transported to the root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here we have an inverted
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's being wicked right to the root
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you've done chromatography,
you can see that same thing here where
[SPEAKER_00]: that solvent front is moving against
gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wicking up the chromatography paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Substrate selection can be very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vermiculite, sawdust, peat moss,
and coco coir can be utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also some rock wool or rock
wool-like material that can also serve as
[SPEAKER_00]: that wick of water and nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This system has no moving parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based on that just natural flow of
water based on capillary action.
[SPEAKER_00]: This capillary action is based on the
movement of materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see here where we've got the
slow movement of water up this substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if we remember back from soil
types and the clay particles versus sand,
[SPEAKER_00]: sand being much larger particles,
example here, clay being much finer or
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller particles, representing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see as those particle sizes
decrease, as that diameter of the tube
[SPEAKER_00]: gets smaller, the height that water can be
wicked is increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, this is a very low cost setup
and very easy to maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, though, the kinds of
capillary action, while they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits, the media becomes saturated with
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, very little oxygen can
get in for a scuba diver here kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: representing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots need to breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to respire.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to take in oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, this can reduce the
efficiency of the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at capillary action,
think of like saturating a sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more water that comes in, sadly,
the less air there will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a theoretical maximum there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we oversaturate the solution and
overhaul the water, yields will decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: simply because of the lack of oxygen being
able to supply to the roots, cutting down
[SPEAKER_00]: their rate of respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
