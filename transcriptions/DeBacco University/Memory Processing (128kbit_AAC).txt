[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to go over a basic overview
of memory processing that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we see in this image, you can kind of
think of the brain here as like the
[SPEAKER_00]: motherboard of a computer in the sense of
the processing of events and storing them
[SPEAKER_00]: for recall later that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this memory processing involves kind of
three main principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, memory is that storage and
retrieval of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to remember we just
don't store it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need to find a way to be able to
retrieve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, storage, as I have here,
occurs in stages that continually change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have, for example, our disk,
our memory card, our tape recorder,
[SPEAKER_00]: back when it was a magnetic strip,
our memory stick, all of these different
[SPEAKER_00]: storage ways when relating it to the
electronic end of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the necessary processing
portion occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is accomplished by the hippocampus
and surrounding structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the actual processing chip here in
a computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, while I'm relating it to
computers, we want to think about that
[SPEAKER_00]: from the human aspect that the same
process and overall process is occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: within our own body.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third one is memory traces.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are chemicals or structural changes
that encode the memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're broken into two parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have short term memory, which appears
to be stored electrically in the form of
[SPEAKER_00]: transient neural excitation, and then we
have long term memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So short term memory, we're talking a
couple seconds to maybe a couple minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe an hour, not much longer than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows the depth of memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here's a quick spike and then it
drops down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, short term memory,
this overlap would be transferred into
[SPEAKER_00]: long term memory, which appears to involve
structural changes in certain neural
[SPEAKER_00]: connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we see here within our short term
memory, our parental lobe here and areas
[SPEAKER_00]: of excitation as we start to transfer
further down into longer term memory,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll notice the cerebellum here becomes
more active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, very little activity there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we're approaching long term memory,
we start to see a couple of dots,
[SPEAKER_00]: see a little increase in intensity,
ultimately leading to more memory
[SPEAKER_00]: processing and storage here in the
cerebellum in relation to long term
[SPEAKER_00]: memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way to kind of relate that is the
retrieval of the memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Memory is not a snapshot stored in the
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually must be put together from
information stored in various parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just kind of like a bunch of
puzzle pieces that come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we don't just want to store it,
we also need to be able to access that
[SPEAKER_00]: into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not just a snapshot, just a bunch of
pictures stored in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually kind of put together as like
puzzle pieces so they can easily be
[SPEAKER_00]: retrieved and accessed at a later date.
Thank you.
