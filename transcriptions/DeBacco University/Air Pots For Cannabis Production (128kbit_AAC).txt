[SPEAKER_00]: You may have seen these odd looking
plastic pots here with all the holes in
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are called airpots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to cover airpots for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's learn more about airpots related to
cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, you may have seen these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the benefits of using airpots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the goal is a healthy root system
and a root development while maximizing
[SPEAKER_00]: aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where they get their name from.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called airpots because they're
increasing aeration to the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shape of the sidewall minimizes root
circling and encourages the formation of
[SPEAKER_00]: fibrous root structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fibrous root structure is really
where a lot of the absorption occurs in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant roots for the actual plant
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fibrous root structure allows for more
efficient nutrient and water absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the advantages of using a pot
of this style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the type of a plastic pot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are made out of typically a
plastic material, at least is what we see
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the images.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually it's a recycled plastic
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an advantage there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the applicability and
environmentalness of the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're made to last up to 10 years,
even in outdoor environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not something you buy once and
just use once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you can use for multiple growth
cycles and potentially multiple years as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air prunes the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the air pot, where does that get its
name from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have this aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why would we want to have air in
that sidewall?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as root grows towards the air holes,
this will prune the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the root is terminated, this induces
root branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this increase in root branching is what
causes an increase in the total surface
[SPEAKER_00]: area and really helps that plant be able
to scavenge for nutrients as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This increase in root branching,
this increase in surface area,
[SPEAKER_00]: all benefits to the plant when we're
dealing with a limited kind of container
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the root mass increase through the
branching, this allows for a greater net
[SPEAKER_00]: to capture nutrients and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have a much finer area to go out
and allow that plant to be readily
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbing water and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they have a wide usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this concept works beyond just cannabis
and has been shown effective in
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables, landscape and nursery plants
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently seem to be more popular in
Europe, which is likely due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: developing company is based in the United
Kingdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is probably a why or contributing
factor to why these pots tend to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more popular in the European
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're being used in the United
States and really all over the world
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the benefits mentioned here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though they may look a little
strange on first inspection, you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the benefits and why growers are
using them for a variety of plants.
