[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing cannabis plants
outdoors, you may have heard of indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: growers flushing their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can only apply to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this can also apply to outdoor
growing of cannabis, and this Tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: University video will provide you with
some specifics on how to flush outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grown cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at flushing outdoor
grown cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, realize that there is no
standardized method, no study studies have
[SPEAKER_00]: been published to date that examine the
exact process of flushing cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this does not mean that is not
common practice, as the idea to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: high quality bud and also minimize inputs
is the play, meaning that we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: how can we maximize our production and
minimize our inputs to have the best
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency as possible with our final end
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the goal of any flushing protocol
indoors or outdoors is to reduce nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations in the root zone so the
plant metabolizes was already present in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really easy to think about in an
indoor growing situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of water added to a
container and the water is being over
[SPEAKER_00]: added, so to speak, and allowing it to
drain out of the container away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone, taking nutrients with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little harder to do in an outdoor setup,
but I'll go over some specifics for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the water properties that you want to
be flushing with, ideally the water should
[SPEAKER_00]: be around room temperature 70 to 75 and
have a slightly acidic pH value of 6.0 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.3 because this will aid in the ability
to ensure nutrients are soluble and easily
[SPEAKER_00]: removed via the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This maximizes the efficiency of removing
those nutrients, dissolving those
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, and getting them away from the
root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can be great to have a little pH
tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit more of a higher end
tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also gives a temperature and
everything, but good to have some idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: what your water properties that you'll be
irrigating with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first nutrient to go when you're
doing this process will be nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's the most water soluble of the
nutrients, so watch for a potential
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency of this nutrient first in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know you have a nitrogen deficiency
because it's characterized by the lower
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves becoming yellow, while the upper
portions of the leaves remain green,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least for a period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you run this for too long, eventually
the whole plant will go yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start to see this kind of yellowing
of the lower leaves, you might be flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: too early in the plant growth cycle or too
aggressively so keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great kind of way to check and
balance your system there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now timing is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can see here with this image,
the goal is to time the reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients with the harvesting of the buds
of the end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plant runs out of nutrients,
this should be very close to harvesting so
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no plant stunting or chance at
yield reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note this is best done if you're going to
be harvesting the entire plant and not
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a selective bud harvest as this may
result in the second harvest being
[SPEAKER_00]: negatively impacted by reduction in plant
available nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now growing conditions do play a role in
this, so you've got to take this into
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the plants grown in field soil or the
plants growing outside in containers?
[SPEAKER_00]: For field soil, what's the soil texture
composition?
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, what's the percent sand silt
and clay?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to play a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in containers,
what are the size of the containers and
[SPEAKER_00]: what substrate is also found in those
containers?
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also impact your protocol to
follow for the flushing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we're looking at field soils,
I said the percent sand silt and clay,
[SPEAKER_00]: we go to our kind of triangle here to kind
of determine are we in a clay soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: a silt loam, a clay loam, a sandy loam,
that all plays into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general though, as a percentage of
clays increase, so does the length of time
[SPEAKER_00]: of the flushing period.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be as much as 15 to 20 days
because clay tends to hold onto nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: much for a much longer period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you work your way up here and your
percentage clay increases, so will your
[SPEAKER_00]: duration of time that should be flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sandy loams down in this region are
typically recommended to flush for 10 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, this can depend on how
aggressive the plants are being fed
[SPEAKER_00]: leading up to harvest as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also realize that flushing is not truly
possible as the roots will likely be quite
[SPEAKER_00]: extensive, but the period of time where
only waters being added can help reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And impact the final yield, and not impact
the final yield, I should say,
[SPEAKER_00]: if done properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great way to kind of reduce
your cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will not be able to fully flush your
plants as a container grower can do,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is a great way to reduce your
overall cost, reduce your chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental contamination while not
impacting in any negative way your final
[SPEAKER_00]: yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing outdoors in
containers, which some growers do,
[SPEAKER_00]: the container size is something to take
into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large containers will typically make
flushing more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply because a total volume of material
and increased likelihood of holding onto
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically large containers, you can favor
in that 10 to 12 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smaller containers make for easy
oversaturation, so the duration of flush
[SPEAKER_00]: time can be reduced at five to seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the substrate
composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the substrate holds nutrients,
the flush time should be longer than if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's more easily drained.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, sandy soils that drain very
easily compared to clay soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you see such a large span
of five to 15 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Complete saturation and flushing may not
be feasible, but not adding nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is reducing costs and not ideally
impacting the final product if done
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your basic flushing protocol,
just in general here, would be while this
[SPEAKER_00]: can be a challenge when the water is
determined when the water is leaving the
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone, it cannot be measured as a very
large container or field soil saturations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So general estimates need to be applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally the starting point to initial
irrigate with two and a half to three
[SPEAKER_00]: times the volume of water as a normal
irrigation event would occur, followed by
[SPEAKER_00]: normal volumes of plain water for the
duration of the time suggested in each
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers like to do this kind of heavy
flush period to really force that water,
[SPEAKER_00]: plain water through to really force some
of those nutrients out of the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily required, but you can have
one irrigation event maybe when you
[SPEAKER_00]: initially start to start the flushing
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a little bit longer duration than
you normally would to initiate this
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this helps you in an outdoor
growing situation to reduce some of your
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs without reducing your yields to
help maximize your efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for watching.
