[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at different
types of mutations that occur,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly looking at DNA and the root
causes of some of these mutations and how
[SPEAKER_00]: they look on the kind of the level of the
chromosome here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see here these might be some
point mutations here that are occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that these don't all quite look 100%
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go over a little bit of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with just a mutation,
genetic material can be altered in two
[SPEAKER_00]: main ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be recombined or there's true
mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A recombination is a change in the
positioning of the genetic material and a
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation is a change in the content of the
genetic material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to understand these two
distinctions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recombination is the positioning,
just where they're physically located,
[SPEAKER_00]: and an actual mutation is the content.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nucleotide sequences might be changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a change from an A to a C,
an adenine to a cytosine and how that
[SPEAKER_00]: changes our amino acid, which can
negatively impact the protein that might
[SPEAKER_00]: be made from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mutation and recombination provide raw
material for evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evolution can be viewed as a selection of
a particular combination of alleles from a
[SPEAKER_00]: pool of alternatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mutations in germline tissue can be
inherited and mutations in some somatic
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues are not inherited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, our somatic cells are like
our regular body cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germlines would be sperm or egg cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somatic tissue mutations can't be passed
from one cell to its descendants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get that from either
parent because somatic is just a point
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to affect the individual
potentially, but not any of their
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mutation in the germline is what's
going to affect the offspring here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important just to make note of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Types of mutations, again, mutations are
caused two ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Errors in DNA replication by mispairing a
base by DNA polymerase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we could have A and T bind
together, but here we have a T binding to
[SPEAKER_00]: a G and that's causing a mutation that
occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or mutagens.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are antigens that can damage DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can occur from UVB light here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see ultraviolet light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun rays have a lot of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can cause these types of mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can cause these errors in the sequences
in the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sequence of DNA can be altered in one
of two main ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is point mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an alteration in one or a few
bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Base substitution, insertion, or deletion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have no mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be the normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA level would be TTC.
[SPEAKER_00]: A silent mutation, it's a mutation that
still occurs from TTC but from TTT,
[SPEAKER_00]: which does change the mRNA level,
but because of the redundancies that
[SPEAKER_00]: occur, the protein level has not changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's called a silent mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also nonsense mutations where TTC
now turns into ATC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should change the mRNA level and this
causes a stop codon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to truncate or reduce the
length of the amino acid sequence that
[SPEAKER_00]: will probably make the protein
non-functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's missense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have conservative and non-conservative.
[SPEAKER_00]: TCC, we're noticing from our TTC,
and we're having a change in the protein
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here we're having this protein wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This amino acid should say while it's
different, has similar properties to the
[SPEAKER_00]: original one.
[SPEAKER_00]: A non-conservative here has a very
different amount of properties and
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is more likely to have a negative
impact than a conservative mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is the normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the cell wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Realize that there are things that can
occur, point mutations, that may cause
[SPEAKER_00]: basically no visible change or no change
in the amino acid sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others can cause a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, if a stop codon is encoded
for, that can really cause a small protein
[SPEAKER_00]: to form and it will probably not be able
to produce its function.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a frameshift mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are insertions or deletions that
throw off the reading frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember our codons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And normally we read in our three codon
sequences, our three nucleotide sequences,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they go right along.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a frameshift occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see lysine and it should be UUU.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have U, U, and that U is removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this G coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So UUG now is encoding for a different
amino acid, which is truncating our
[SPEAKER_00]: protein because now a stop codon is
reached.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this UAG is a stop codon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see up here, UAG is up here also.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because we're reading in these
distinctive three portion codons,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not read as UAG as it's pictured
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's read as AUA and then GUG and then
CCG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: These frameshifts can really cause
negative effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because we're reading in those three
codon sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by removing one, we've completely
frameshift everything that falls down the
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two other ones, transposition or moving
the genes from one part of the genome to
[SPEAKER_00]: another, which is what this is trying to
show here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spicing it out, put it in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can occur both in eukaryotes and
prokaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chromosomal rearrangements or
translocations as the name implies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have translocated the genes and it's
changing the position and or the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: segments in a chromosome in eukaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a chromosome four and a
chromosome 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're cutting off a piece of
chromosome 20, we're putting it in
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome four.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're chopping this piece of chromosome
four off and put it in chromosome 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially the DNA on the cellular level
is all the same, but it's mixed up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a reason why we have
chromosome four and chromosome 20 in the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene sync code for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cell is going to go looking for those
particular proteins in those chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that they've been moved,
that's going to cause negative effects to
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Types of mutations, a deletion as it would
imply.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is simply the loss of a portion of
chromosome indicated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Duplication, an extra copy of part of the
chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just duplicating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two copies now instead of just one
like we should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inversions is reverse direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're taking our DNA sequence and
reversing it, flipping it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to cause some negative
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insertion, that's what we just talked
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additional portion of a chromosome is
attached to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then translocation, part of one
chromosome attaches to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So insertion, we're just inserting
something where it shouldn't belong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Translocation, we're moving it to
different genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How this may look, this is the reference
sequence looking at this very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: region right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should read A, B, C, D.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a deletion would look like A,
C, D, or missing the B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inversion of the B sequence, which goes A,
C, B, D.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we notice that the B and the C is
inverted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a duplication, A, B, B,
C, D, two Bs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And multiple copies, A, B, C, B,
C, B, C, D, causing all sorts of weird
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations, all different than the
original.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've referenced sequence here,
and all could lead to negative effects by
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell and ultimately the organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: What causes these mutations?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole host of potential reasons
for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be UV radiation, cigarette smoke,
could be virus induced in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain ingredients and products,
X-rays can cause this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just one source.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main categories are radiation,
chemicals, and infectious agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mutation, smoking, and lung cancer,
there's a label, again, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's cigarettes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agents that cause cancer are called
carcinogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're typically mutagens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hypotheses that chemicals cause cancer was
first advanced in the 18th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many investigations since then have
determined that chemicals can cause cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: in both animals and humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tars and other chemicals in cigarette
smoke is a prime example of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leading causes of death in 2014 for males
and females, very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Causes in both males and females.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, heart disease is a little higher
in males than it is females.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fervent cancer is also a little higher
in males than females.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you an idea that heart disease
and cancer, a high percentage of the
[SPEAKER_00]: causes of death in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's get too morbid, but kind of ranking
the top 10 causes of death for 2014 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice here diseases of the heart being
number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malignant neoplasms, number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a significant drop off for
number four, other lower respiratory
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases, accidents here, and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see here heart disease,
very common, most likely cause of death
[SPEAKER_00]: from the 2014 data that's pulled up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that wasn't too morbid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives you a little bit of background
of what mutations are and what negative
[SPEAKER_00]: effects they may occur.
