[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this enzyme lab, we're going to
use common household items such as potato,
[SPEAKER_00]: carrots, and mushrooms along with hydrogen
peroxide to study the catalase enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here we're going to be looking at
a catalase enzyme normal reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at catalase contains in this
potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at potato and how it reacts
to hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is typical store-bought and this is
looking at about 3% hydrogen peroxide
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to see how this reacts and
look at some observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to observe a normal
catalase reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've cut a piece of potato and we're
going to add that to the test tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the four mils of a hydrogen
peroxide located right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just drop that in and let's just
observe what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing that slow release there,
seeing the concentration of those bubbles
[SPEAKER_00]: forming at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is just a regular potato and
3% hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are back at our first reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're noticing that it's still reacting a
little bit, but it's definitely slowed
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to progress with this
portion of the lab now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now reading the lab instructions,
we're instructed to take the liquid from
[SPEAKER_00]: test tube one, this is test tube one here,
and put it into a second test tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all I'm going to do is take the liquid
from here and we're simply going to pour
[SPEAKER_00]: it into our second test tube, trying to
make sure we don't also include the
[SPEAKER_00]: potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pouring off that liquid,
decanting that liquid there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so now I've got the liquid poured
off from the first test tube, put into the
[SPEAKER_00]: second and the question now asks,
well, what would happen if I added another
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of potato?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've cut a fresh piece of potato of
similar size, similar surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to add it here to the test
tube and we're going to see what happens
[SPEAKER_00]: for the reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So drop it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a quick observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look here at the test tube,
we are seeing some bubble formation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that is a fresh piece of potato and we
can clearly see that the reaction rate is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we saw with the first reaction there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So important to keep in mind that the
variability that we have here in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: that while we have that catalase enzyme is
at the same concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, the reactants aren't fully there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've reacted a lot of the hydrogen
peroxide away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while there is still some left
overall, that reaction is greatly reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: from when we saw it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in contrast here, we're looking at
that first piece of potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I have now is the same four mils
of hydrogen peroxide there, a fresh four
[SPEAKER_00]: mils of hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to add it to our original
potato and see what happens here for a
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can see there, and I spilled just a
little bit looking very closely there and
[SPEAKER_00]: add just a little bit more, make sure that
they're even.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got the same amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the amount that I spilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there now, if we're looking at the
reaction, we too see it reacting,
[SPEAKER_00]: but reacting very slowly compared to the
initial reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that that is definitely much
reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we do a quick comparison,
looking at kind of a normal size,
[SPEAKER_00]: normal potato, we'll see that there is a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for comparison purposes, if I take that
fresh four mils of hydrogen peroxide and a
[SPEAKER_00]: brand new fresh potato and I add it there,
we can see the difference now in reaction
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes just a couple seconds to get
going, but we are noticing definitely more
[SPEAKER_00]: bubbles being produced here with the fresh
potato and fresh hydrogen peroxide
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the potato that already went
through a reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we then added fresh hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here was the decanted hydrogen peroxide,
the ones that had went through the
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction with a fresh piece of potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, these two are reacting
somewhat, but definitely much reduced now
[SPEAKER_00]: we can see compared to the original.
[SPEAKER_00]: This goes back to products and reactants
as far as how much do we have of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when one is used up, it becomes a
limiting reactant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a great visual to kind of
show that looking specifically at the
[SPEAKER_00]: catalase enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I have some different food items
and we're going to assess the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: catalase enzyme they have based on their
reaction with hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got the potato, I've got the
carrot, and I've got a mushroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've cut sections here, try to keep the
surface area the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to now add them to the
respective test tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to see how the reaction
rates may differ in relation to the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of catalase enzyme each of these contains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to try to add them at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more bubble production we're
associating with greater catalase enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to keep everything consistent,
make sure they're all submerged in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, look at our rate of reaction,
make sure they're all kind of coming in
[SPEAKER_00]: contact adequately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of see the differences that
might be occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going to look at and see how
temperature will affect this catalase
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have a piece of potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've tried to keep all the potato
pieces consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this in a warm water bath.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say warm water, well,
what does that actually mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's take the temperature of our
warm water bath there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to let this sit in there for
approximately maybe five minutes or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to ensure the potato chunk's fully
exposed to that temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just under 64, 63.7 is where it has
settled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our warm water bath here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on from warm water, we're going to
go to the ice water bath.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ice water bath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I have just kind of some ice water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is melting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of determine what the temperature is
of that ice water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have got our little potato literally
chilling in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as would be expected, it's much
cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're looking at quite zero
degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at about 0.4 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so moving on to room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here the room temperature one
is balanced out at 22.0 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, also here progressing to the boiling
water one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the water is boiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get the thermometer in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking like specifically going to balance
out right at 100 degrees Celsius for our
[SPEAKER_00]: boiling water potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll let that sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we saw earlier, what I have now is
potatoes that have been in different
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures for approximately 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was in an ice water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was in room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is in a warm temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was at boiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I have now is four mils of
hydrogen peroxide that I'm going to add to
[SPEAKER_00]: each.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will now see how they react,
these potatoes, after being in these
[SPEAKER_00]: different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, as the ice water, this one is
room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have warm water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have boiling water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this shows a difference in
temperature that everything was exposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have hydrogen peroxide that was
chilled in an ice water bath.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the hydrogen peroxide was kept at
room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where it was warmed in the warm
water bath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here the potato was left at boiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in all of these cases, we boiled the
potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: We warmed the potato up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have chilled potato and
hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can see as it's warming up,
we are noticing that there is a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of a reaction occurring here.
[SPEAKER_00]: By far the room temperature is performing
the best with the greatest amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: bubbles produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: The warmed one does have a couple bubbles
produced, but nothing really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the boiling one is just stagnant or
sitting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this tell us about the
optimum rate in temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the catalyst enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first test tube here, I've added
hydrochloric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This middle one here is regular tap water,
very neutral pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last one has had its sodium
hydroxide added to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're thinking about it this way,
we're increasing pH from a very low pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: to a neutral pH, to a basic pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I have prepared equal size potato
pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to add them to the
hydrogen peroxide that has had its pH
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusted, either lower, normal,
or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to see how they react.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it takes just a little while to
get going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we look carefully, we can
definitely see that the acid, this one
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll create right here, is definitely
occurring at a reduced rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of with that black background,
you can see the base here is reacting to
[SPEAKER_00]: some degree, but definitely that more
neutral pH of seven has the greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: production there of the bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But looking at this, we're definitely
concluding that the pH definitely does
[SPEAKER_00]: impact the catalyst enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're noticing that there is that
difference in reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see what environment the
catalyst enzyme would not be favorable in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, still able to react to some degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at this end, at the acidic end,
but we're looking at defining the optimum
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that there's definitely a
difference there.
Thank you.
Thank you.
