[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this Tobacco University video,
we're going to look at the most simple
[SPEAKER_00]: form of carbon dioxide dosing,
and that's with a timer release here.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be able to calculate the duration and
frequency, carbon dioxide will be added to
[SPEAKER_00]: the growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at carbon dioxide
timed release for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, by far, this is the least
expensive option.
[SPEAKER_00]: By simply attaching a carbon dioxide
regulator or even a CO2 generator to a
[SPEAKER_00]: timer, the growth base can be enriched
with carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what these are basically are cycle
timers, and you set for how long you want
[SPEAKER_00]: the timer or the timer set to be on,
and then for what duration of time you
[SPEAKER_00]: want it to be off for in the sensor,
or the timer will go through and regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: that throughout the entire duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what we're noticing here,
which I like about this one, it has a
[SPEAKER_00]: light sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it's going to do is it's going to
go through its cycle timer sequence when
[SPEAKER_00]: it senses that photocell, since there's
enough light there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other timers will just go through 24 hours
a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one actually has a nice little light
sensor to ensure you're only going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: dosing carbon dioxide during the light
cycle, which is when plants can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a word of caution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without monitoring the carbon dioxide
levels, this can cause uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: The levels could be too high or too low
without you knowing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be providing only an estimation
of the carbon dioxide levels in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: A carbon dioxide detector should be
installed to avoid potentially dangerous
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, which is above 5,000 parts per
million of carbon dioxide to human health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you're just taking random
guesses as far as what the carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: levels are actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, adjustments during the growing cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are using this timer based
system, keep in mind that as plants grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll be consuming more carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make adjustments during the
growth cycle when plants are smaller,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to be using less.
[SPEAKER_00]: As plants get larger, you might want to up
either the duration or the frequency that
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be dosing the area with carbon
dioxide enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, basic controller is highly
recommended over a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even getting a simple or very basic timer,
this can help provide a much more accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: form of carbon dioxide delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want that controller because it offers
many advantages over estimations of just a
[SPEAKER_00]: simple timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have it on for this and offer this
duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the most simple or basic of CO2
controllers can be much more advantageous
[SPEAKER_00]: over a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: For consistency in a growth setup,
the cost of a timer should be factored in
[SPEAKER_00]: so the rest of the cost of setup equipment
can be maximized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially, some of these controllers
may cost more than your cycle timers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in the long run, it can actually save
you more money and also create a better
[SPEAKER_00]: growing environment overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if our goal here is to maximize
cannabis yield in the end, over the course
[SPEAKER_00]: of a growing cycle, cannabis plants will
become many times larger than they were at
[SPEAKER_00]: this very small propagation stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be difficult to make these
adjustments with a timer as the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: season progresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a controller that's sensing
the environment, it can automatically make
[SPEAKER_00]: those adjustments, make those changes to
ensure the environment, at least from
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide enrichment standpoint,
is consistent to your plants over the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire growth cycle, maximizing their
yield, assuming all other factors are not
[SPEAKER_00]: limiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this small addition, additional
investment early on can produce big yields
[SPEAKER_00]: in the end of your growing cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to investigate all
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, timers are great if you want to
explore initially, but a controller-based
[SPEAKER_00]: system with or even without fuzzy logic
would be highly recommended over a timer,
[SPEAKER_00]: recycle timer dosing system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
