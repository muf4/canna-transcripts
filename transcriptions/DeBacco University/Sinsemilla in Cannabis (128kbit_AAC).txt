[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, in the pictures here we see two
female flowers produced in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's unique about these flowers is that
there's no seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sinsa-mille is what's called in cannabis
when you produce a flower that does not
[SPEAKER_00]: produce any seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sinsa-mille is a female flower that has
not been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the most potent part of the plant
where the highest cannabinoid production
[SPEAKER_00]: in CBD will be produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to have the plant produce all
of its energy and reserves into producing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and not producing seeds
through this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now why not pollinate a flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the lack of pollination signals in
the plant to produce more resin attempts
[SPEAKER_00]: to increase the odds of capturing pollen
that may be in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the plant's response to not being
pollinated initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trying to go through and increasing
the odds that it could get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This same plant stressor also increases
the production of cannabinoids which are
[SPEAKER_00]: present in the structures we see here
called trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If pollen does reach the female flower,
the energy will be by the plant allocated
[SPEAKER_00]: to producing seeds and this will reduce
the amount of cannabinoids produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in part why it's so important to
identify male flowers early on so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not getting this potential for
pollination which will vastly reduce your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
