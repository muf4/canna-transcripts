[SPEAKER_00]: While there may be many pruning tools to
choose from, in general they fall into
[SPEAKER_00]: three main categories which I'm going to
discuss briefly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of those three, the first one is plant
removal, and this is done at the point of
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest and requires heavy-duty loppers
that we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be very robust and good for
cutting the entire plant down at the main
[SPEAKER_00]: stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have for large cuts, which should
be avoided ideally, but often necessary at
[SPEAKER_00]: some points we have these large heavy-duty
hand pruners.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one is detail pruning,
we see evident here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This requires more labor but can result in
a more efficient plant over the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these have a very small cutting area,
and these are kind of for cutting those
[SPEAKER_00]: nice weak stems, those nice kind of weak
leaves out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a very quick, very efficient
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can fit your whole hand in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the three main types of
pruning tools that you would use with a
[SPEAKER_00]: typical cannabis operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
