[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're looking to determine the
peak harvest of your cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: this Tobacco University video is going to
give you three main plant components to be
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at to determining that peak
harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into visually timing
a cannabis plant's peak harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, three things you should be looking at
within the plant would be the stigmas,
[SPEAKER_00]: the trichomes, and the size and
development of the actual flower or bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, each of these will be briefly covered
in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you want to learn about any of
these in more detail, there'll be a
[SPEAKER_00]: separate video that will go into showing
you some examples visually, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: providing descriptions for each of these
plant parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those stigmas, trichomes, and size and
development all focus really on that main
[SPEAKER_00]: flower and bud and looking at some of the
details that look at the development of
[SPEAKER_00]: that bud or flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the stigmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a female part of the flower is the
stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is sticky where the pollen would land
and start the fertilization process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our goal in cannabis is to not have
those plants be fertilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis, the structure looks like kind
of fine white fuzzy structures that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of resemble a whisker.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because this is an area that would
try to go out and try to capture a pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: grain that might be floating in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could easily grab on and get stuck into
here and then go through and pollinate
[SPEAKER_00]: that said flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they have this fine hair-like
appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they're sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a random pollen grain kind of
floating through.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was to land here, it'd be stuck and
go through that fertilization process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another plant structure, the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is often used as the main kind of
sense of, is the flower ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they are small mushroom-shaped
glands that are responsible for producing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids as well as terpenes for the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They coat the surface, having resin
provides a frontline defense against
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus, insects, and hungry herbivores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are a protection mechanism of
plants in general, but they also are the
[SPEAKER_00]: site of cannabinoid and terpene
production, which is advantageous for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, we have just the general bud
size and development on a plant where
[SPEAKER_00]: there will be variability in buds in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to produce large and dense
buds consistently on a plant, which can be
[SPEAKER_00]: influenced by the light exposure to the
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why there's different pruning
strategies implemented to try to maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: that bud size development and also
density.
[SPEAKER_00]: To maximize this production, pruning
styles play a role in this final product,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly for indoor growers that have
limited or direct light sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pruning them so that they're exposed,
more of those buds are exposed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: higher intensity light will help increase
the size development and density and
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately the quality of the final
product that you're producing.
And that's it for this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
