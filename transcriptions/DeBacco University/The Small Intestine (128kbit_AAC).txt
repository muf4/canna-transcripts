[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let the name fool you, it's small
intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very important part of the
digestive system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind this also occurs,
this is where our food items are directly
[SPEAKER_00]: entering after they leave the stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go from the stomach to the small
intestine and then to the large intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stomach to small intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the small intestine in a little
bit more detail, it's the body's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's called true digestive vat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does vat mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that is just that kind of area of
that mixing pot there of where all of this
[SPEAKER_00]: food items kind of mixing, occurring,
digested, and also very importantly,
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That breakdown of large molecules into
smaller ones, which are then absorbed
[SPEAKER_00]: directly into the bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: The total length of the small intestine is
about 19 and a half feet or about six
[SPEAKER_00]: meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's quite the long tube that we have
as part of the digestive tract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now within that small intestine,
we have our villi.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have our microvilli, highly
increasing that surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously our blood capillaries,
our venules are allowing for this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in surface area to help the body
more efficiently absorb nutrients because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a very important component of the
small intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what does that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Histology, kind of that kind of cutaway
here of our villi and our muscle layers
[SPEAKER_00]: are absorbed, our absorptive surface,
our lacteals, our capillaries,
[SPEAKER_00]: our arteries, our goblet cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on in this small
intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see though in all the images here,
we can see the folds that are occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the villi, an electron graph
here of the microvilli because they are
[SPEAKER_00]: really small here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of this, again, is helping
increase the surface area to help the body
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to absorb, which is a very
important function of the small intestine,
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the small intestine,
we just left the stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to the duodenum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first 10 inches, approximately
4% of the small intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is closest to the stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the mixing bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: It receives the chyne from the stomach and
digestive secretions from the pancreas and
[SPEAKER_00]: also the liver are in close proximity
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The duodenum is the actual site of
digestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pancreas secretes important digestive
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The liver secretes bile salts into it that
make it easier for fats to be digested.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a separate video lecture on
the liver there where you can learn a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more about what that secretes
and also the pancreas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Functions of the duodenum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It receives the chyne again from the
stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that first portion of the small
intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also is very important that it
neutralizes the acids before they damage
[SPEAKER_00]: the highly absorptive surfaces of the
small intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to increase that pH from that pH
of 2 We need to bring it up a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: to that more closer to neutral and even
slightly basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on, the jejunum is the middle part
of the small intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about 8.2 feet long.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this location, there is chemical
digestion and also very important nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: absorption that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see here the transverse section,
how high that surface area to volume ratio
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is allowing foods passing through to
very easily be absorbed into the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very small villi, lots of these little
finger-like projections allowing when food
[SPEAKER_00]: passes through for that to be absorbed in
the capillaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, we have the ilium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the final segment of the small
intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also important for absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 11.5 feet long.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's sphincters that control the flow
of material in the ilium into the large
[SPEAKER_00]: intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the presence of goblet cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see one right here in a little zoom in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These secrete mucus-like substances called
mucins in the wall of an ilium villi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we also have this important for
secretion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They help keep everything lubricated as
we're working our way through the
[SPEAKER_00]: digestive process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, in our small intestine,
we have intestinal secretions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're watery.
[SPEAKER_00]: We secrete about 1.8 liters per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enter this intestinal lumen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It moistens the chyme, buffers acid so we
don't want to burn our very important
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbative surfaces, keeps digestive
enzymes and products of digestion in
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intestinal movements that kind of arrives
in the duodenum right out of the stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weak peristalic action here moving it
towards the duodenum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is now under central nervous system
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of that smooth muscle helping
mix and move our food.
[SPEAKER_00]: After we leave the small intestine,
we're then going to enter the large intestine.
