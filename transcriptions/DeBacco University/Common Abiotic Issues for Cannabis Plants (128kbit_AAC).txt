[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
we're going to be looking at things that
[SPEAKER_00]: go beyond just disease that can infect
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at some abiotic issues
which can also reduce yields and increase
[SPEAKER_00]: plant stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so here we're going to look at
common abiotic issues for cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at abiotic factors being those
non-living components of an ecosystem,
[SPEAKER_00]: wind, sunlight, soil, temperature,
atmosphere, and water are just a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: that fall under this category.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not always a disease that causes a
reduction in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, general abiotic characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, typically symptoms will appear
suddenly if it is an abiotic issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: A uniform pattern can also typically be
observed and it's though not common to be
[SPEAKER_00]: only on a single plant, meaning you're not
likely to just have one plant that has an
[SPEAKER_00]: infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see many have this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing more than one variety,
it's possible for there to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctive difference between variety
though not always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lesions tend to have distinct lines of
impact and not impacted tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when we're looking at our lesions,
they tend to have these kind of harsh
[SPEAKER_00]: lines versus if it was a disease,
they can kind of have a spreading
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Abiotic factors tend to have a little bit
more of a harsher line associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what are some stresses when we're
looking at abiotic stresses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they can lead to secondary plant
stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat, cold, heavy metals, nutrients,
salinity, drought, flooding, all these can
[SPEAKER_00]: cause abiotic stresses that lead to
secondary stresses on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a result.
[SPEAKER_00]: This causes the damage to the plant that
can be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these factors, these secondary
stresses can lead to cell death,
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation, survival, and other negative
impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, looking at shoot-related abiotic
diseases, what's occurring on the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, heat can come from light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be artificial or even the sun
can cause heat stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also cold, which is a particularly
concerned early in the late and outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For indoor grows, watch the lights off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature, and be sure you're moderating
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another video here on Nebraska
University looking at the relationship of
[SPEAKER_00]: frost, which is cold damage on outdoor
grown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, root zone abiotic stresses,
there are many.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, growers overfeed their plants,
leading to nutrient toxicities,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a plant stressor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is tested in the final plant
material, so be sure to know what your
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate and your inputs are,
so you're limiting the chance of having
[SPEAKER_00]: any potential heavy metal stress on your
root structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salinity, this can happen with chemical or
organic fertilizers, so be watchful of
[SPEAKER_00]: this, and flushing plants is advised to
reduce the salt concentration if it does
[SPEAKER_00]: get to a level that is causing plant
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drought, which is sometimes not
intentional, but be sure to check each
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to ensure the irrigation system
you're using is fully functional,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as flooding, which can be caused
by damage to an irrigation line or simply
[SPEAKER_00]: overwatering plants, so be sure to get a
feel for the substrate for each individual
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to make sure you're not over or
under watering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these are kind of root zone stresses
with the above ground stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eliminating and being mindful of these and
reducing these stresses on the plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: help improve plant efficiency,
as well as yield.
