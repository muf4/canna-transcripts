[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at the
inflammatory response process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I like the image included here of our
foot showing different degrees of
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation, with this toe having the
greatest degree of redness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to learn about a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's occurring at the cellular level when
we see this external appearance on our
[SPEAKER_00]: skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with, in general, the
inflammatory response, well, it all starts
[SPEAKER_00]: with an injury, and ultimately it leads to
the healing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may think of, when we hear the term
inflammatory, such as some of the negative
[SPEAKER_00]: factors, the redness, the swelling,
the heat, and the pain, but essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: that is part of the healing process,
and ultimately this is what has to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through the body in order to try to
eliminate sources of infection so that
[SPEAKER_00]: proper healing can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the inflammatory response,
here's our skin, and we have an injury,
[SPEAKER_00]: a cut, for example, in that skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice it's red and the presence of
bacteria here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our leukocytes, our white blood cells,
are leaving the circulatory system to
[SPEAKER_00]: invade this area to try to prevent
infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in general, this inflammatory
response is triggered whenever the body
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues are injured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, in this case, we're looking at skin
tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole goal, the whole purpose of this
is to limit the spread of damaging agents
[SPEAKER_00]: such as the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the body needs to dispose of
deprecating pathogens, and this sets the
[SPEAKER_00]: stage by cleaning up this area of
potential sources of infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sets the stage for a proper healing
or repair process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at this image, we notice that
three main stages are occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we have injured tissue,
which is up here, and we're noticing our
[SPEAKER_00]: leukocytes are entering that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, this leukocyte in particular,
this mast cell, is releasing histamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemicals are causing the blood vessels to
expand and become more permeable,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's causing redness and swelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: This image doesn't do a great job of
showing the redness and the swelling,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what is causing that redness and that
swelling is the red blood cells or the red
[SPEAKER_00]: blood vesicles here becoming more
permeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's causing the redness and the swelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this influx of red blood cells,
this influx of white blood cells also to
[SPEAKER_00]: the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neutrophils and then monocytes and
macrophages migrate to the site of
[SPEAKER_00]: infection or injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're working their way through these
epidermal cells, and they're working their
[SPEAKER_00]: way to that initial cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're noticing some bacteria are
being taken in and destroyed, limiting the
[SPEAKER_00]: chance that they could get into the
circulatory system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, acute inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen this picture similarly before,
but it shows the histamine being released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we see the white blood cells or
leukocytes exiting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the vesicle here and entering the
area where the pathogens are present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mast cells detect injury in nearby
cells, release histamine, initiating the
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammatory response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Histamine increases the blood flow to the
wound site.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see an increased amount of redness and
increased vascular permeability,
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing fluid, proteins, phagocytes,
and other immune cells to enter infected
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: These events result in the swelling,
the redness of the injury site due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in blood flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also feel warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we ever have that injury that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inflammation is also associated with pain
due to the events of stimulating nerve
[SPEAKER_00]: pain receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be because of the initial cut
site, or it could be also because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cascading of events that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, signs of inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's five main ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at redness, clearly evident
here, the feeling of heat and swelling,
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence of pain, and potential loss of
function in the inflammation area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are our five cardinal signs of
acute inflammation occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Histamines, which I mentioned before,
they help our body get rid of irritants
[SPEAKER_00]: such as allergens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can make you sneeze, tear up,
itch, to help remove that irritant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times we associate these with
being negative associations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's all our histamines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, our mast cells are the ones
that's inducing those histamines and
[SPEAKER_00]: causes inflammation and or increased mucus
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this is in relation to an allergen,
this is looked at as very negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it can be advantageous in an
inflammation sense to help increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: blood flow there and increase the white
blood cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in relation to an allergy,
we have things called antihistamines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're chemicals or drugs taken in order
to reduce symptoms of allergic reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They block histamines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here they're blocking some of those
receptors released from the mast cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: They decrease the incidence of symptoms
caused by histamine response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because histamine is not able to bind
all these receptors, the response is
[SPEAKER_00]: dulled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what some of Benadryl,
Allegra, Zyrtec, Claritin, some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: antihistamines function in this very
similar format where they're able to block
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the receptors, clog up some of
those pores, reducing the effectiveness of
[SPEAKER_00]: the histamine, reducing the allergic
response that we have, reducing some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the redness and the swelling and the
tearing and all the negative associations
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have with allergies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
