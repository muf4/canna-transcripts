[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to provide a brief
overview of some season extenders in the
[SPEAKER_00]: different styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers use these terms
interchangeably, but I want you to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what each of these different
titles refers to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just season extenders, all of these are
performing the same task.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, there's our small style,
the season extenders, and they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: covering the rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can help protect small plantings
or early plantings or plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to stay small initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great options there.
[SPEAKER_00]: To extend the season there, to get out a
little bit earlier or to hold them a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit later in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's our midsize season extenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are called caterpillar tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great if you're considering a high
tunnel, but are unsure if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: commit to a high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're easy to set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can set one up easily over a weekend,
maybe a day, at least for the first one
[SPEAKER_00]: takes a little bit of time to get
everything oriented, but offer a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the advantages that a high tunnel offers,
but a little bit quicker, easier and
[SPEAKER_00]: cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upgrading from our midsize, we have our
large size.
[SPEAKER_00]: These would be our full high tunnels,
which is kind of this size here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to grants are becoming very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do get more than one, I do
recommend you get two of the same size
[SPEAKER_00]: because it makes the management of them a
lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have advantages, but they need to be
taken care of, especially in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Removing plastic is a great option to
prevent them from caving in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they can lead to buildup of
nutrients in pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you're not removing the plastic,
so it's good to kind of remove that
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic, let some snow, let some winter
rains come through to kind of flush out
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the nutrients that may have been
accumulated in them over the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, high tunnels are different than
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: High tunnels are temporary and do not have
extra heat sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouses are more of a permanent
structure, typically a floor here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that evidently here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be example of a high tunnel can
technically be moved pretty easily and not
permanent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, season extensions, no matter what
size or unit you're using, be sure to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: them clean inside and out is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is often overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduce the potential for disease
carryover, limit the local pest pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also why I recommend using insect
netting to eliminate insects, but keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: them clean, both interior and exterior.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of a farm I visited.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the high tunnel that they
have, and you can see it's very clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is even during the peak of tomato
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, in between the rows are all nice and
cleanly kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irrigation under here, nicely pruned,
nicely trained.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping that high tunnel clean is very
important to reducing disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, season extension can be early,
such as March, April, and May,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the advantage to see the jump on the
season can often get ahead of pest
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I think they're most
advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Late in the season, extending crops into
September, October, November, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: continue the season for longer to get
closer to a Thanksgiving meal if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to supply that for maybe a CSA,
but the pest pressure can be higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little bit of a precaution if you
want to go later in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, it's best to get that early
season jump because you're beating out the
[SPEAKER_00]: pest as long as you keep your structure
clean.
So, that's a little bit of a precaution.
So, that's a little bit of a precaution.
