[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking at utilizing well
water for outdoor plant production,
[SPEAKER_00]: this DeBaco University video is for you to
help you provide some details and
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration for this type of water
source.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into well water for
outdoor cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, with any water source,
you want to be sure you're testing the
[SPEAKER_00]: base water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have a starting point of
exactly what's your water at as a base
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you would test for would be parts per
million, EC, pH, and temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these can be easily determined
with a quality water meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, specifics for well water include
mineral content.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, is it particularly hard water
or is it considered to be soft water?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an important consideration you should
be making.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with well water, we can see a couple
examples of wells right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is typically required is a large
pump to basically bring the water up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, growers want to limit the
number of cycles, which is basically
[SPEAKER_00]: on-off changes, with their well pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is advised to turn that pump on and let
it run for as long as you need to and then
[SPEAKER_00]: turn it off and let it sit for a duration
of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to just constantly on-off,
on-off with the pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to irrigation, this means
running it for longer periods of time and
[SPEAKER_00]: not short durations.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, like a mist system would
require would not be advised for well
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you could bring that well water up
into a storage tank and pump out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be utilized for the propagation
misting environment that you might want to
[SPEAKER_00]: create.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are requirements to have these
kind of short on-off cycles, instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: using that kind of another tank,
it's strongly encouraged because that pump
[SPEAKER_00]: can handle the on-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The well pump should not be utilized for
that purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with well water, we also want to be
mindful of the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the summer, cooler than normal
temperatures might be advantageous to cool
[SPEAKER_00]: the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But early in late in the season,
this cooler temperature can be a drawback,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly involved with the propagation
or early on starting of seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pumping water into a holding tank for
natural warming with the sun is an option
[SPEAKER_00]: for increasing the temperature of the
water before it is applied to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because typically, depending on the depth
of the well, overall those well water
[SPEAKER_00]: tends to be colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're looking at propagation and
germination of seeds or getting clones to
[SPEAKER_00]: root, that colder water temp could slow
down the metabolic rate and cause some
[SPEAKER_00]: potential issues, versus just taking that
same water and increasing the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: to normal ambient conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now well water, hard water treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're looking at well water being
identified as hard water, a water
[SPEAKER_00]: softening system can be used to treat that
hard water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water softeners use ion exchange to
replace the hardness or minerals in the
[SPEAKER_00]: water, typically calcium and magnesium
ions, with sodium ions to make the water
[SPEAKER_00]: soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this may not be the best option
for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the salt levels may be too high,
requiring additional steps to be performed
[SPEAKER_00]: when treating the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a descaler options that are
used, uses a magnetic field and does not
[SPEAKER_00]: use salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see here, scale watcher
example, looking at electrical field
[SPEAKER_00]: through that irrigation water to try to
accomplish the same basic end result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now scale control media technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is this kind of all about?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is using a salt free scale
control media, typically abbreviated SCM
[SPEAKER_00]: technology, that's designed to prevent
scale formation and protect plumbing from
[SPEAKER_00]: corrosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only can it be a benefit to the
plants, it can also be a benefit to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plumbing and irrigation system overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This SCM technology alters the structure
of the hard minerals into crystalline
[SPEAKER_00]: structure that prevents the minerals from
binding and forming kind of a scale
[SPEAKER_00]: buildup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it like clogging of your
arteries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike salt based water softeners,
these SCM technology will not demineralize
[SPEAKER_00]: your water, nor will it add excessive
amounts of sodium to your water system,
[SPEAKER_00]: both advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the PPM may still be higher than
growers would like, so the resulting water
[SPEAKER_00]: should still be checked, because that can
affect the amount of nutrients you're able
[SPEAKER_00]: to add to that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the best system, and best is always
kind of a relative term here, the best
[SPEAKER_00]: system would be considered a reverse
osmosis system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is great for removing minerals,
but will often come at the cost of reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: flow rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can be great systems as far as the
end result of watering they produce,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the rate at which they produce it may
not be fast enough for growers to directly
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this means oftentimes the water
generated from these reverse osmosis
[SPEAKER_00]: systems needs to be stored in tanks to be
used at higher volume rates required by
[SPEAKER_00]: most irrigation methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just kind of a word of reason here,
kind of tossing it here at the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that we have our PPM levels,
parts per million levels of the well water
[SPEAKER_00]: are around 200 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not necessarily a death sentence
to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers freak out and think they
need to have it below 100, but that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will restrict the amount of total
nutrients you can add, but in most outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: settings there will be a natural rainfall
at some point, so the hardness of the
[SPEAKER_00]: water, again within reason, may not be
worth completely worrying about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something you need to completely
freak out all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you do want to keep an eye on the
metal parts, motors, and fittings and
[SPEAKER_00]: watching out for corrosion, and this kind
of gives you just a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: classification of water and kind of what
the general range is expected for that
[SPEAKER_00]: water as far as some of the mineral
components that you might be getting as a
[SPEAKER_00]: result of a test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep in mind brine, your sea water,
brine water is your heavily salted water,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then your fresh water would be kind
of, quote, your purist water, your
[SPEAKER_00]: drinking water, but you can see slightly
brackish can still be considered for
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is particularly important for outdoor
irrigation in the sense you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: natural rainfall that can help flush some
of those salts out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an indoor grower and utilizing
some of these sources, you might want to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a little lower tolerance levels
because you might be getting that natural
[SPEAKER_00]: rain to flush any of these potential
components out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just keep all of this in mind,
and hopefully this, by watching this,
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants will benefit and appreciate
from you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
