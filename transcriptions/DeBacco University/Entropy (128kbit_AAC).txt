[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at the term
entropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of like this image right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we learned about the term,
this has a very low entropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very high entropy on this side
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low entropy is nice, neat, organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: High entropy, you can see that increase in
disorder and that's spreading out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So entropy, it's the measure of the degree
of randomness or disorder or usable energy
[SPEAKER_00]: in a closed system that's not available
for useful work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we see something as low entropy,
it's a much more ordered system.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here, low entropy, nice, ordered,
organized system here, as you can see here
[SPEAKER_00]: in the tall tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a very low entropy and we are
increasing our entropy here with that
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing amount of randomness that
occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: High entropy is going to have a high
amount of randomness, this
[SPEAKER_00]: disorganization, this disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that low entropy progressing to an
area of high entropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second law of thermodynamics is
actually referring to is referring to
[SPEAKER_00]: entropy increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, low entropy, nice and organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: High entropy, very random.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that in this also.
[SPEAKER_00]: The controlled demolition of the calcium
in New Haven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start with that low entropy,
it's nice, neat, and organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the explosive go off and now we
have a very high degree of entropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that kind of increasing in the
amount of randomness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start very nice, neat, and organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a very random, messy pile
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So entropy, referring it to the food chain
and trophic levels, the useful energy
[SPEAKER_00]: available to the next level decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our sun's energy here,
and that is involved with our primary
[SPEAKER_00]: producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 100% of the energy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we work from primary producers to
primary consumers up our trophic levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: roughly 10% of the energy is transferred
from one trophic level to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're simply moving that decimal by 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is preventing large amounts of
trophic levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why our apex predators are so few
and far between while our primary
[SPEAKER_00]: producers are very prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun's energy and recycled nutrients
are the main sources of energy here in our
[SPEAKER_00]: pyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as we're reducing the amount of energy
that's transferred, where's the energy
[SPEAKER_00]: going?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to still take account for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of it's lost energy as heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say the word lost, we know
where it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just becomes unusable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we can consider it lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also decomposers in any one of these
stages can break these trophic levels down
[SPEAKER_00]: and add back in the recycled nutrients to
the bottom of the pyramid that the primary
[SPEAKER_00]: producers can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, it can fall into the cycle
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this is a little bit of an
understanding what entropy is and a degree
[SPEAKER_00]: of randomness or the degree of disorder
that may exist in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can relate it to your room,
where your room might have a high degree
[SPEAKER_00]: of entropy, where it's very messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go through and organize it,
you'll have a very low sense of entropy,
[SPEAKER_00]: a high degree of organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
