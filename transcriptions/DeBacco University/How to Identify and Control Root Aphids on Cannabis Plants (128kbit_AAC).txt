[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
we're going to be looking at root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we may be familiar with aphids
that typically are seen affecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves and the stems, can't also forget
about these root aphids, which can also
[SPEAKER_00]: negatively impact your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to be looking at root
aphids, something we might be more
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with in the top growths of the
plant, but they also can affect the lower
[SPEAKER_00]: portions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we identify and control them on
our cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, the rice root aphid is
what's going to be focused on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a dark green insect with generally
round body form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wingless stages develop on roots and
they survive on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wing stages periodically emerge from
the soil and they fly to new plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's how they're able to spread
their infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have a wide host range,
including indoor cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: even when grown hydroponically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just don't think because you're not
growing in a solid substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even hydroponic growers should be mindful
of this threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root aphids at notification and the plant
damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at 73 degrees Fahrenheit in optimum
temperature, rice root aphids populations
[SPEAKER_00]: can double every 1.6 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can go very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we can see what they look like at the
kind of wingless root aphids at the base
[SPEAKER_00]: of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see the winged rice root aphids
trapped on a cannabis leaf here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have them developing within a
hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see the roots and we do see them
identified right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then within the soil of the rice
plant, like here and here, these rice root
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids, I should say, the cannabis plant
appeared in the lighter and lower portion
[SPEAKER_00]: of the picture, which can be difficult
initially to see and do require that
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also kind of highlighted here,
what they look like, kind of mixed in with
[SPEAKER_00]: the substrate that the cannabis plant are
growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, identification clearly evident,
but can be a little more difficult because
[SPEAKER_00]: of their size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So careful inspection and scouting is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you go about managing them if
you do identify them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, root aphid management is especially
challenging in organic systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Study was conducted, at least in celery,
so it's something, to evaluate the
[SPEAKER_00]: effectiveness of certain products applied
via drip irrigation drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: Valuations were pre-treatment,
post-treatment one, which is application
[SPEAKER_00]: 13, 10 days after the treatment,
and post-2 application, 10 days after the
[SPEAKER_00]: first treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at their data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was their results.
[SPEAKER_00]: They determined that when the overall
change in aphid populations after both
[SPEAKER_00]: applications compared to the pre-treatment
numbers was considered, there was,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can see the results here,
untreated over here, 3% reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: untreated control, 24, 18, and 129%
increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: these three listed products, respectively.
However, MyoTrol O, along with Asagard,
provided 62% reduction in aphid
populations, followed by 12% reduction in
pre-treatment numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at their data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these were the results, and when the
overall change in aphid populations after
[SPEAKER_00]: both applications compared to the
pre-treatment numbers were considered,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a 3% reduction in untreated
controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see those listed right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24, 18, and 29% increase in these three
listed products, respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, MyoTrol O, along with Asagard,
provided 62% reduction in aphid
[SPEAKER_00]: populations, followed by a 29% reduction
in Grandivo and 24% by venerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This study demonstrates the potential for
nonchemical options when managing aphid
[SPEAKER_00]: populations, at least in organic celery.
[SPEAKER_00]: These microbial pesticides, especially in
combination with botanical pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: can play a significant role in pest
management, understanding the modes of
[SPEAKER_00]: action and different options, and using
the right combination is critical to pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to find data like this,
while not in cannabis, can at least
[SPEAKER_00]: provide a good starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for all the products we see again,
the first one is the pre-treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: post-treatment one, and post-treatment
two, looking at mean number of aphids per
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, we can see how the changes
occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, utilizing a combination
definitely showed a pretty significant
[SPEAKER_00]: here reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, worth considering, and at least
a starting point, if you're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: what products may be effective if you do
identify root aphids in your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
