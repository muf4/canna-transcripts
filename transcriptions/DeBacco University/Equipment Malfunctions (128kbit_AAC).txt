[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at a growing
environment, we're looking at modifying
[SPEAKER_00]: the conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these conditions I have here are
kind of the six most popular ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times we use equipment to do this
and this equipment can malfunction so we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be mindful of that so we don't
have these technical difficulties because
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants are not going to wait idly by.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In any grow operation there is a need to
include equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to know what equipment is rated
for and do not exceed the recommendations
[SPEAKER_00]: as this can shorten the life of the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could be, for example,
water pumps or heaters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They usually have stated amounts or areas
that they cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to try to hit that recommended
amount or below.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you exceed that, that's where you're
shorting the life of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also be aware of maintenance that may be
required with any piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: As often as can be very easy or minimal
but it doesn't mean it can be missed or
[SPEAKER_00]: forgotten about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, just checking the oil in
your car can be a very quick and easy task
[SPEAKER_00]: but something that if forgotten about
could lead to failure of the engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for one thing we're trying to moderate
typically in a grow area is heating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally heat requires some form of
energy source.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to make sure you have a
consistent source of this energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be wood, this could be coal,
this could be propane, this could be
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural gas, regular gas, a whole bunch of
different options here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you plan ahead for your
heating source especially as you get into
[SPEAKER_00]: colder winter conditions where you're
likely to go through the required heat
[SPEAKER_00]: source much quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be running out or
ordering it when everyone else needs it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prices will go up and it will be harder to
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opposite of that we have cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can often be very costly for
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is possible to cool an outdoor grow
space with shade netting, kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: putting sunglasses over the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind this will reduce the
overall light that reaches the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be mindful of how much you're shading
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fans do not cool the plant, they only mix
the air and keep it moving which can help
[SPEAKER_00]: increase your transpiration to aid in the
natural cooling process of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: True cooling will require an air exchange
as an air conditioner unit, split level
[SPEAKER_00]: cooling units.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different options but
they typically consume a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity so keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: For lights, old bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bulbs reduce their efficiency slowly over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result growers will typically not
notice a poorly producing bulb simply by
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll still appear to be very bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where parameters come in and are
highly recommended as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: documentation of the purchase date and
estimated number of hours of usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can write the purchase date right on
the bulb itself or keep that as part of
[SPEAKER_00]: your records so you kind of know about
when you should be changing that out on
[SPEAKER_00]: the calendar based on the hours you plan
on using that bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reflectors, can't forget about the bulbs,
can't forget about the reflectors here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two different options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reflectors can also reduce their
efficiency over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bulbs need to be changed more frequently
but changing the reflector should be
[SPEAKER_00]: considered about every two to four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to know if or estimate your
reflector efficiency is to test with a PAR
[SPEAKER_00]: meter each time you add a new bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that two feet away, let that bulb
warm up, test the PAR at the plant level
[SPEAKER_00]: and every time you add a new bulb,
test it out and see based on documentation
[SPEAKER_00]: and records, see if it's the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll tell you the amount of light being
reflected and if it becomes below a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain amount, you want to consider
changing out that reflector you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: The photo period determines the stage of
growth the plant will be in and if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a problem with the amount of light or
really you want to think about as hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: continuous darkness, this can create
plants that are not in the proper stage
[SPEAKER_00]: that the grower expects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purchasing quality timers and also check
them to ensure their accuracy during the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers will prefer these analog
style ones because they can physically see
[SPEAKER_00]: if it gets off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Digital ones, you kind of got to be there
to be able to tell there's no real
[SPEAKER_00]: physical means you can go through and take
a look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, they both work just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers do prefer the analog for that
reason but have some way of checking to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure your plants are under the proper
photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Community is important because depending
on the growth stage, the plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: determine the proper percentage you want
to maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: When plants are younger and smaller,
you want to have a higher community.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they get older and start to produce the
buds, we want to reduce that community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, having control over this,
emptying containers, having a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate the community are all important
things to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water pumps, often pumps are a necessary
component, but growers will commonly
[SPEAKER_00]: undersize the pumps causing an increase in
wear and tear, reducing their overall
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to oversize pumps to be sure and
continue to monitor them since they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: typically burn out without little warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also set up a schedule to ensure regular
cleanings of filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are running a complex operation
here and you have some filters,
[SPEAKER_00]: those filters may need to be changed at
certain times, or just go through and
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor them depending on the quality of
water that you have, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: sediment filter or chlorine filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fans are great for air circulation,
but they can die without warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you also want to be mindful of how old
they are, what their expected life may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the blades and cages to ensure that
they're cleaned as needed to maintain the
[SPEAKER_00]: peak efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You typically accumulate a lot of dust in
the fan blades, and that can cause them to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of overheat and work harder than they
need to, which can vastly reduce their
[SPEAKER_00]: expected life.
Thanks for watching, and have a great day.
