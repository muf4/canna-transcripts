[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBacco University video,
we're going to look at the threat of some
[SPEAKER_00]: grower errors to cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we've all made mistakes when
growing, here's going to be some helpful
[SPEAKER_00]: tips to help you try to avoid some of
those common grower errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as we can see here, these plants
definitely look a little stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be excessive nutrients, could be
improper pH, but we're going to go over
[SPEAKER_00]: the threat of grower errors to cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you don't make some of these
same errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, realize that when you're
growing plants, errors will be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: As growers, errors will be made,
but identifying them and limiting the
[SPEAKER_00]: negative impacts they have are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know your own errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Own your own errors, if you will,
and realize them, own up to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then make adjustments from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Documentation is important to be able to
recognize an error that may have been made
[SPEAKER_00]: a while back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little time to show up in
certain plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are not immediate, some take time,
and it's important to have that
[SPEAKER_00]: documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to be writing down your
dilution rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as growers typically use a lot of
different products, and that's nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong with that, but have an area where
dilution rates are written down as a
[SPEAKER_00]: reference so you can ensure you do not
work from memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also be sure to actually measure and
estimate the amount that's being added.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could write it right on the
bottle, have a set chart, have a set paper
[SPEAKER_00]: you always go to, so you're not just going
off of memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also check the pH in concentration of
anything that you're adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: To ensure any unnecessary plant stress is
added, be sure to check your solution to
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid something being applied that is
outside of the expected range.
[SPEAKER_00]: These blue garden monitors give you
temperature, the pH values, the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also just a quick little pen here to go
through and check can be a great way to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure that you're not going to give the
plants any sort of stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is particularly important at the very
early stage, or propagation stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: as plants are very susceptible to very
high doses of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can cause burn or crinkling of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be extra mindful during that phase to
ensure you're not giving them something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's way out the range of the accepted
pH or concentration range to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of you inducing any errors and
negative impacts on your tender cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
