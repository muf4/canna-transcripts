[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at the
evolution of circulatory systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go from a very basic here
with basically like a flatworm to a very
[SPEAKER_00]: complex system like our own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one of the first evolutionary steps
here was the development of a
[SPEAKER_00]: gastrovascular cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cnidarians and flatworms have a cavity
that both function for digestion as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while they do have a circulatory
system, they also kind of overlap here
[SPEAKER_00]: with the digestive system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why these are considered our
most primitive of organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Building from that we then have organisms
like this that have developed what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: an open circulatory system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what this entails is there is no
distinction between circulating fluid,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as blood, and fluid of body tissues,
which is lymph, a hemolymph is what it's
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically referred to as.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's kind of this mixture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these open circulatory systems such as
our mollusk here for example of the snail,
[SPEAKER_00]: and arthropods is our B below.
[SPEAKER_00]: These open circulatory systems,
the fluid called hemolymph, is pumped
[SPEAKER_00]: through blood vessels that empties into
the body cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hemolymph returns to blood vessels
through openings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what makes this so primitive,
you may think, oh it's just pumping blood
[SPEAKER_00]: and lymph around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it's just kind of going into a
category.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not really like a very controlled
or specific system that's being pumped
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here we have multiple hearts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having this kind of mixed mixtures
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ostria here are the openings and you can
see that there's many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's kind of open,
because blood could flow to here,
[SPEAKER_00]: to here, to come around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Closed circulatory systems, such as
annelids and vertebrates, they have
[SPEAKER_00]: circulating fluid blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always enclosed within vessels.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the definition, that's what makes
it closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This transports blood away from and back
to a pump, in this case being the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our example here of our earthworm.
[SPEAKER_00]: These closed circulatory systems,
pictured in both of these images here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the heart pumps blood through vessels that
separate from the interstitial fluid of
[SPEAKER_00]: the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not only organized with the
vessels, but there's also a separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most vertebrates and some invertebrates,
such as the annelid earthworm,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I pictured here, have a closed
circulatory system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what these kind of blood vessels look
like, in a more detailed sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as birds and mammals, they have a
heart, which is the pump, blood vessels,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are the networks of tubes,
and blood is the actual circulating fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now specifically we refer to these
vesicles that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some as arteries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arteries carry blood away, they away from
the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veins return blood to the heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And capillaries connect these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is areas where we're having exchange
of nutrients and or oxygen in carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blood plasma passes through the
capillaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pressure forces the fluid out of the
capillary walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of this interstitial fluid returns
back to the capillaries, and some lymph
[SPEAKER_00]: vessels are returned to the venous blood
in specific sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of have this distinction
between the lymph system and our exact
[SPEAKER_00]: circulatory system, even though both do
kind of work in covert with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this gives you a little bit
of the timeline and the different
[SPEAKER_00]: complexities related to circulatory
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
