[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this tobacco university video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going looking at general cannabis
breeding overview, just kind of looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: a general overview of something that can
be quite complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this will provide a little
description that I developed some basic
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the basic review overview,
I should say of heredity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other videos are provided on this channel
to better understand the basic breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: process, because I said it can get quite
confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at planet squares and
medallion genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll touch on that just a little bit
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Realize this is a very complex topic and I
just hope to give you that basic overview
[SPEAKER_00]: here on this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we have to understand the
basics of, for example, genes and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant and there's recessive genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding the difference between
those two is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Individuals receive one version of a gene
called an allele from each parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the alleles are different, the dominant
allele will be expressed while the effect
[SPEAKER_00]: of the other allele called recessive is
met.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a dominant gene will be expressed and
can mask or override the effect of a
[SPEAKER_00]: different variant of the same gene on the
other copy of the chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recessive genes, an individual must
inherit two copies of the mutated allele
[SPEAKER_00]: or to express that trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind, this does not mean that
genes are bad or negative recessive genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are, but not necessarily all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes recessive and dominant genes
here have really no major effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we can see the example here of
having a attached earlobe versus kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctive earlobe here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of recessive trait and
dominant trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean that the recessive can hear
any worse than the dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of a phenotype or what
it would physically look like compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: the genotype, the genetics here and we can
trace that through different lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you get into things called sometimes
true breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And true breeding is a kind of breeding
where the parents would produce offspring
[SPEAKER_00]: that would carry the same phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, phenotype is how the organism
looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that the parents are homozygous
for every trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: This example, we're reading purple with
purple, getting purple, breeding purple
[SPEAKER_00]: with purple, getting purple, so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're true breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come true from type.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the same thing here with the white
flowers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we're noticing that
self-pollination, we're getting more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more of the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: These would be examples of true breeding
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind there's two sex chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We identify a female as having two exes
and a male as having an X and a Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we get the female flowers as
we can see here and then the male flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see closer to me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is again boy and girl, same example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the Y is drawn smaller, at least in
humans, because the Y chromosome does
[SPEAKER_00]: contain less genes than the larger X.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a simplified Punnett square,
and this may take you back to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: biology class, where you're looking at
crossing two genotypes together and this
[SPEAKER_00]: Punnett square is just a quick way to
organize things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way to kind of quickly go
through things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the big G would be dominant over
the little G.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a heterozygous, this is called,
where we have a dominant and recessive
[SPEAKER_00]: allele with a dominant and recessive
allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: We breed them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25% or one out of four would be the
homozygous dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% would be heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one dominant and one recessive
allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then 25% would be homozygous recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now phenotypically, or how they would
look, 75% of these would be green if the
[SPEAKER_00]: capital G represents green color and 25%
would be yellow because they need to both
[SPEAKER_00]: inherit both of those genes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just a simplified quick run through
of Punnett squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might hear things called like the F1
and the F2 generation because some traits
[SPEAKER_00]: may skip a generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have the parental generation,
the F1 and the F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example, the parental generation,
we have a tall plant and a short plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see their genotype here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When these are bred together, all the
resulting offspring are tall, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: all heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all contain that masked or that
hidden recessive allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we breed these together,
we see those short varieties come back
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: They skipped that generation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to keep that breeding
lineage going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that here again with the
kind of two cannabis strains breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: those together where we're tracking
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use a female from these seeds,
make a back cross, talk a second about
[SPEAKER_00]: back crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keeping a lineage and kind of a family
tree is important for tracking traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that back crossing that I briefly
mentioned previously, back crossing is
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing of a hybrid with one of its
parents or an individually genetically
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to its parent in order to achieve
offspring with a generic identity,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is closer to that of the parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like going backwards
literally within the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have our parental strain,
we have our F1 strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have that back cross going back
through and reverting it to one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: parental there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's helping limit the kind of
variability that you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have two parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a good way to kind of
visually consider it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents A and parents R, breed them
together, we get offspring B.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to breed offspring B with that
recurrent parent, parent R again.
[SPEAKER_00]: B with R, we get C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then C, we breed that with R again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're kind of back crossing the sense
we're going back to those genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're constantly bringing those back into
the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: To try to create some genetic variability,
but also kind of keep an idea of some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those traits recurring back in the
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Gregor Mendel was a monk that studied
pea plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are kind of an example of kind of
dihybrid crosses are called.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is a simplified example.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phenotypes are provided in this
simplified example.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a great visual that we can
see tall plants and green plants looking
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many traits do not follow Mendelian
inherence, so it's important to keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this helps show the variability that
can occur from a basic cross involving
[SPEAKER_00]: only two traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say they don't inherit all
Mendelian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, here we either have green
or we have kind of that purple color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a chance we could get green
with purple spots or purple with green
[SPEAKER_00]: spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a lot of complexities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you look at this to go,
well, this is pretty complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a simplified version of
having either a trait being expressed or
[SPEAKER_00]: not expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Following those Mendelian inheritance,
either tall plants or they're short
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're either green or they're purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why keeping a track record of
your breeding projects, having a good
[SPEAKER_00]: idea, going in and reviewing this video as
well as other videos that are on this
[SPEAKER_00]: channel as well as others can be important
to know what you're getting into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a good understanding of the
breeding process so that you can be
[SPEAKER_00]: effective with the time that you spend and
have an idea of what to look for,
[SPEAKER_00]: what to select against to create a
hopeful, successful breeding project.
