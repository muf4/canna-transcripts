[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, here we're going to look at oil
and sweat glands, and hopefully by the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of this you'll be able to provide a
comparison between oil producing glands
[SPEAKER_00]: and sweat producing glands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I say oil, this is actually vegetable
oil, but just trying to give you that
[SPEAKER_00]: visual comparison between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these are going to be located,
as you see here, in the dermal region of
[SPEAKER_00]: the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with our sebaceous glands,
or oil glands, they occur over the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: body except the palms and soles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're simple aviola glands, and they
help to form secretions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically, the entire cell will break
up to form a secretion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see a comparison between
oil and sweat glands later in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: These oil glands secrete this oily
substance called sebum, and they're mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with the hair follicles we see
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our sebum, and they're
associated with that hair follicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that image of the skin comes back,
and hopefully it's starting to make more
[SPEAKER_00]: sense with each video that you watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those sebaceous glands, that oil
producing glands, what does this sebum
[SPEAKER_00]: actually do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see kind of it here, and it's
providing a lubrication to the hair and
[SPEAKER_00]: also the surrounding skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also softening both of these regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is an oil, so it's hydrophobic,
and it also provides some waterproofing,
[SPEAKER_00]: some resistance to water of both the hair
and skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's being secreted and covering all
this region, it can also collect dirt to
[SPEAKER_00]: help maintain cleanliness of the skin and
overall health of the individual,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see again, located here is our
sebaceous gland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our hair follicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the sebum releasing to the surface
of the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now sweat glands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to take a step here on sweat glands,
we're going to do a little comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two main types.
[SPEAKER_00]: They occur over the entire skin surface
except nipples and parts of external
[SPEAKER_00]: genitalia, and they prevent overheating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can produce, in total, up to 500 cc,
cubic centimeters, you can also think of
[SPEAKER_00]: that as milliliters, to 12 liters of sweat
per day, and that is going to be mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be activated or produce these
secretions due to heat, or also stress is
[SPEAKER_00]: another way that these sweat glands can be
activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's just an example of one located here
within the dermal layer of the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now sweat glands are pseudoriphrous
glands.
[SPEAKER_00]: The maricrine or echocrine glands,
most abundant sweat gland, they produce
[SPEAKER_00]: what we call true sweat.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 99% water was some salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They contain some traces of metabolic
base, up to 2% urea, but not really any
[SPEAKER_00]: more than that, so you get the 99%.
[SPEAKER_00]: They open through pores, and their role is
thermal regulation, so that can cool the
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're widely present in the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 500 can be located in just a single
square centimeter from the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see an image here of that secretion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is occurring through pores,
and you're going to notice the comparison
[SPEAKER_00]: between the other two helps very
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maricrine here, also echocrine,
the kind of interchangeable terms,
[SPEAKER_00]: these sweat glands are being secreted in
this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another type of sweat glands,
the apocrine, are the apex or top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cell breaks off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can think of that kind of apex AP,
meaning to apex, that top of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They contain organic molecules that
decompose over time, resulting in this
[SPEAKER_00]: odorous secretion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because the cell is breaking off,
we're putting this odor, because we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more than just water being kind of
released here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ducks open into the hair follicles,
absent before puberty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this occurs only after puberty do these
particular glands develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're present in the armpit and
genitalia areas, and they release
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins, lipids, in the form of steroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because we're getting proteins and
lipids being released in parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cell, this is what's producing that odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot more than just water with a
little salt in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actual portions of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one here, going back to oil
glands, this part of this odor is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: add a little bit of a comparison between
all three of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Halocrine, the entire cell is breaking
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's releasing the sebum, which is an oil
lipid base, remember that's hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lubricating the skin and retards
bacterial growth, both benefits to the
[SPEAKER_00]: body and skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Found on the face, chest and back regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mature cell dies and becomes a
secretory product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do all these kind of three compare?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's a nice summary slide showing
the secretion versus the cell being
[SPEAKER_00]: pinched off, kind of that producing the
odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have the entire cell basically
being broken down, producing that sebum,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is that oily substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, for comparison, our sebaceous or
oil glands versus our halocrine and our
[SPEAKER_00]: echocrine glands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have to look here at our images.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some are separated out from the hair
follicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's our sweat gland located with
the hair follicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, our oil gland also associated
with that hair follicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our echocrine glands or apocrine glands
located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is independent, which is the echocrine
we see here in the blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our apocrine glands here are
associated with the hair follicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, don't forget these sebaceous
or oil glands are also associated with the
[SPEAKER_00]: hair follicles we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, what's associated with the hair
follicle?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's out, great for identification
purposes, and it can also help you
[SPEAKER_00]: remember where they may or may not be
found within the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
