[SPEAKER_00]: So we have probably all heard someone
saying, I need to go outside and get some
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight to get my vitamin D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're going to kind of learn about
some of the science that's behind this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some people have the misconception
that vitamin D just kind of rains from the
[SPEAKER_00]: sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of sends down vitamin D to
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily 100% the case,
but learn about what the sun does give us
[SPEAKER_00]: and what we do absorb here and how it does
relate to our vitamin D production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here the sunlight shining
down on all these people on the nice beach
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of them are getting exposed to
the rays and making vitamin D.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is vitamin D?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, D3 is a specific vitamin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's foods high in vitamin D,
so sunlight is not the only source of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an important nutrient for
maintaining a healthy skeleton,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it forms an integral part of bone
metabolism, calcium and phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most natural way to get vitamin D is,
of course, by exposing your bare skin to
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultraviolet B rays in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stress the point bare skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just outside and you're all kind
of bundled up and covered up with jackets
[SPEAKER_00]: and hats and gloves, you're not really
getting the vitamin D production.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,000 IU, which is international units,
is what's considered what people need as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as a sufficient vitamin D amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to relate to the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember, the sun produces a visible
light, but also we're going to be focusing
[SPEAKER_00]: here on the ultraviolet lights,
UVC, UVB, and UVA in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with our UV rays and exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember, UVC is filtered out
actually by the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while the sun does produce UVC rays,
they're filtered out well above our heads
[SPEAKER_00]: in the stratosphere and into the ozone.
[SPEAKER_00]: UVB rays in this wavelength here are
considered burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: They enter the surface of the epidermal
layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, that's our top layer of the
skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: UVA are considered aging.
[SPEAKER_00]: UV wavelengths, because they penetrate
deep into the dermis and the subcutaneous
[SPEAKER_00]: or hypodermis, just above the hypodermis
kind of layer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For these, we cannot see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our visible light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our ultraviolet here is in less than
approximately 400 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that 200-ish to 400-ish nanometers in
wavelength that we can't see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wish I mentioned those UV lights,
is you may have seen sunglasses,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they offer UV protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Filters out 100% of all UVA, B,
and C in harmful blue light up to 400
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers are polarized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to filter out 100% of UVC rays,
it may sound great, but there's one kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of major flaw with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the atmosphere actually filters out
the UVC rays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not really exposed to those
wavelengths unless you're kind of taking
[SPEAKER_00]: your sunglasses up above the ozone layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they may be right that you're filtering
out those UVC rays, but you're probably
[SPEAKER_00]: not being exposed to them in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just kind of watch the marketing on
certain things when you understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see through some of the
things that they are offering up in their
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of advertisements to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So skin type does impact this ability to
process vitamin D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people, you know, burn easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are individuals here on the beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are probably, this individual
probably will burn very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people more likely to tan,
and some people have innate protections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember that this, you have more than
just your skin type.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use sunscreen, or simply
covering your skin can reduce UV light
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Saudi Arabia, there's a lot of
sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply covering yourself can help reduce
your exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at the UVA rays relating
to tanning, and here's our visible light,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then our UVB relating to vitamin D.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does this skin type, what's the
point of going over this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this kind of table below shows
different types of skin types.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just labeled skin type one,
two, three, four, five, and six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's their skin colors, a little
description, and some characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably most familiar with the
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know someone that always burns,
never tans, they're kind of that skin type
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very fair, red or blonde hair,
blue eyes, freckles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, to kind of type three here,
sometimes a mild burn, gradually tanned,
[SPEAKER_00]: tans, fair, any eye or hair color,
very common skin type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the way here, six black hair,
dark brown eyes, may never burn,
[SPEAKER_00]: tans very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to understand your skin
type, because you're going to see how that
[SPEAKER_00]: relates to your amount of light exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have heard, I need 10 minutes
of sunlight to get my vitamin D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's not always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of, how much sun do I need then
if it's not 10 minutes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, specific recommendations to reach
that 1,000 international units of vitamin
[SPEAKER_00]: D are not that easy to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skin types are different depending on the
day of year, place, and time of day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recommendations all vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use two examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both at noon, one year in Miami and one
year in Boston.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with Miami, bright sunny
Miami, if you have skin type three,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll probably need about six minutes of
exposure to sun in summer and 15 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, in the winter in the Northern
Hemisphere, that kind of angle of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sun's going to be a little less in the
winter, less intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you need a greater amount of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you're skin type five,
still in Miami at noon, you're probably
[SPEAKER_00]: going to need about 15 minutes in the
summer and 30 minutes in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little different there for skin
type five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just remember, skin type five,
again, is that darker brown color versus
[SPEAKER_00]: fair skin color for that skin type three.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Boston now at noon,
someone with skin type three will probably
[SPEAKER_00]: need about an hour of exposure to the sun
in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone in the summer with skin type
five will probably need about two hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're wondering where I got these
numbers from, the link is located here at
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now during winter, which is interesting
about Boston, after winter months,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really not possible for anyone to
make vitamin D in the sun no matter the
[SPEAKER_00]: skin type.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun angle's very reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also it might be, typically Boston's very
cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be covered up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very hard to get any vitamin D from the
sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's important also to consume
vitamin D in the diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this hopefully gives you a little bit
of the idea of it's not just as easy as,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I need 10 minutes of sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on your skin type, depends on your
location, and also depends on the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this gets you a greater
understanding for bodies and you're able
[SPEAKER_00]: to manufacture and make vitamin D from the
sun and realize it's not as easy as that
[SPEAKER_00]: simple, eh, 10 minutes and I'm good.
