[SPEAKER_00]: This DeBaco University video is going to
look at some of the beneficial insects
[SPEAKER_00]: that you would like to find on your
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will also end with a picture of a nice
lady beetle nymph crawling around on a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant, helping control some
aphids on that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into beneficial
insects for cannabis plants, ones that we
[SPEAKER_00]: would want to see and identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what's this kind of video
lecture going to cover?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these are going to be the ones that
we're going to go through and cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's anyone in particular
interest, you can go through and jump to
[SPEAKER_00]: that one, or at least, you know,
the ones that will be covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, these are the ones we want to
find or encourage to live in and around
[SPEAKER_00]: our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one is Cypherid flies,
or called hover flies a lot of times,
[SPEAKER_00]: or flower flies sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most beneficial for targeting mostly
slow-moving, soft-bodied insects such as
[SPEAKER_00]: mealybugs and especially aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also attack scale and some
species of thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just kind of shows you some of
these hover flies, what they look like,
[SPEAKER_00]: or flower flies in the adult stage,
the larva stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here is one actively feeding on a
colony of aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's just going to give you this
brief overview of find this insect,
[SPEAKER_00]: what it might go through and be best
utilized for controlling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have green lacewings here,
and these adults feed on nectar,
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen, and honeydew while the larvae are
active predators of soft-bodied insect
[SPEAKER_00]: pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the larvae that are really doing
most of the feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of one of the larvae
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, a little scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it feed on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it feeds mostly on aphids,
thrips, whiteflies, leafhoppers,
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites, especially red mites,
and also mealybugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like a pretty great list here
of insects that these feed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to purchase larvae as this is the
most advantageous for immediate treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: of a pest problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are purchasing the adults,
we see right here and here for size
[SPEAKER_00]: orientation, you are seeking to establish
a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So larvae that do the main feeding on
those pest insects, the adults you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at establishing a population in
your area, which would not be a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also purchase eggs that will soon
hatch into larvae and kind of start the
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the colops beetle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here they are important predators for
soft-bodied insects, whiteflies,
[SPEAKER_00]: of all stages of whiteflies, small lingus
nymphs, aphids, mites, the zepterin eggs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and well as caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can be important for the natural
control of whiteflies and field
[SPEAKER_00]: applications along with selective
insecticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you're having that kind of
whitefly issue, this might be one worth
[SPEAKER_00]: considering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also have, next up we have the
damsel bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're predators of aphids, moths,
eggs, and small caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also includes corn earworms,
as well as European corn borer,
[SPEAKER_00]: imported caterpillars, cabbage worm,
and some army worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very important pests, particularly for
those outdoor growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other prey may include leaf hoppers,
small soft flies, larvae, mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: tarnished plant bugs, nymphs, asparagus
beetles, collared potato beetle eggs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and nymphs as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see these damsel bugs in the adult
and nymph stage and how they look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: different stages here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This they call the nymph stage,
this kind of ice cream cone shaped body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have the adult pictured there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, good insects to be on the lookout
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inspired assassin bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're different species of assassin
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just a one size fits all
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are one of the largest,
at least in size, of the insect predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They typically feed on various
caterpillars such as corn earworms,
[SPEAKER_00]: zebra caterpillars, and yellow striped
army worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example of an adult assassin
bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see some others as well,
as also in the larval stages and the egg
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these assassin bugs do just as the
name implies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go through and they try to
assassinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hopefully negative bugs that are
in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these will be the beneficial ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the pirate bugs here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are really small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, as a comparison, most of these
bugs are small.
[SPEAKER_00]: The assassins are on the larger side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to show you the size orientation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are one of the most common general
predators in field crops, but can also be
[SPEAKER_00]: used for indoor growing environments as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Merging early in the spring, their diet
consists of a variety of small pests,
[SPEAKER_00]: which include thrips, whitefly nymphs,
and aphids, as seen in the images here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whiteflies here, and here's some aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They reproduce quickly and complete their
total life cycle in just three to four
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, making them effective at handling
serious infestations relatively quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they are small.
[SPEAKER_00]: As size comparison here, the aphids,
and they are larger, but they're not that
[SPEAKER_00]: much larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be aware of the size of these when
you're trying to go through and identify
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have them or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly up here, we have the lady beetles,
or also known as just simply ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are different species of lady
beetles we can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to give you a little variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're natural enemies of many insects,
in particular aphids and other sap feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some species prefer mite or scale
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if using them as a biological control,
check to make sure you're maximizing the
[SPEAKER_00]: effectiveness for your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What insect are you trying to get them to
control?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as mentioned, this is ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their kind of nymph stage looks very
different than their adult stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a beneficial insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the time when they do consume,
kind of they get into that life cycle of
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have aphids around, having these
around is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've included a short video where I did
find a nymph feeding on some aphids on a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant that I welcome you to watch
and enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, not all bugs are bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at, right here,
a ladybug out of nymph or larval stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important when we're looking at
having beneficial insects and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: great at controlling aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sadly, this plant does have some
aphids on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having some beneficial insects,
such as showing that we're having that
[SPEAKER_00]: progression, that completed life cycle,
will help naturally reduce the pest
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without doing any damage to the crop here.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in order for them to be
effective, they must be applied early and
[SPEAKER_00]: in large numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're in a large greenhouse,
so it is definitely beneficial in keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: them kind of trapped in here, so you're
not losing them to the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there can also be times where applying
them to an outside environment would be
[SPEAKER_00]: warranted.
Thanks for watching.
