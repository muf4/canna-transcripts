[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm going to go over a cannabis
cloning procedure, which came out to be 13
[SPEAKER_00]: steps, which I know may not be the
luckiest number, but I try to break it
[SPEAKER_00]: down so it's easy to follow to allow a
successful cloning procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first basic process of this is step
one, and kind of most important,
[SPEAKER_00]: is to select a healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a healthy plant, that's a female,
at least two months old, can go as young
[SPEAKER_00]: as one month, but that's kind of pushing
it, has not been overfed nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a female, at least they're about two
months old, and has not been overfed
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen fertilizer, as that will make the
rooting process much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next step is you want to cut, you want a
clean sterilized knife to cut a side shoot
[SPEAKER_00]: that's about three to six inches long,
and has a stem diameter of about an eighth
[SPEAKER_00]: to a quarter inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be cut flat or at a 45 degree
angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean you have to kind of get out a
protractor and measure exactly that 45
[SPEAKER_00]: degree angle, because it doesn't have a
great impact on the rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 45 degree angle is beneficial sticking
into a media because it will penetrate a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit easier, but you can kind of do
a flat cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be at a perfect 45
degree angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step three would be a leaf count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you want to remove some lower
leaves, maybe necessary to allow enough
[SPEAKER_00]: stem exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a bunch of cannabis clones here to
be placed into holding media.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an aeroponic cloner here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The end cutting should have at least two
sets of leaves above the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: If making many clones over a large area,
store recently cut clones in water or high
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity with minimal light exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole point there is you want to
reduce the stress on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're taking a lot of clones,
like in this situation, you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately get them in an area that
doesn't cause a lot of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the time from cutting to clone
placing into a cloning environment should
[SPEAKER_00]: be kept as short as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to reduce that stress or under
enough stress as it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why we want to remove those
lower leaves is you want to keep in mind
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where the roots are going to start
or initiate from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reducing that lower leaves allows more
efficient area for rooting or sticking in
[SPEAKER_00]: this case in these foam holders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step four would be applying a rooting
hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apply a chosen rooting hormone
according to the directions of the portion
[SPEAKER_00]: of the stem where rooting needs to be
encouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's to begin that nice lower
portion there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I have used Clon-X gel and it
produced great success of any other
[SPEAKER_00]: rooting gel that I've used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sticks really nice and it produces
great results for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have a growing media ready to go for an
easy transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to add a heating mat to
slightly elevate the temperature above
[SPEAKER_00]: ambient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be around that 70 to 75 degrees
will help encourage root development.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go much higher than that,
some growers like to all the way up to
[SPEAKER_00]: like 70 is good and 90 Fahrenheit must be
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 is not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root zones rarely get that hot and it
doesn't allow for efficient root
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 70 degrees is just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to also be using propagation mix to
help reduce the chance of having air
[SPEAKER_00]: pockets and to keep good moisture contact
with that newly stuck stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're sticking into media,
first we get a double hole like a little
[SPEAKER_00]: puncture hole can be done with a sharpened
pencil into rock wool, sand, soilless
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture or other fine substrate to reduce
the chance of breaking the stem when you
[SPEAKER_00]: go to place that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using the clone machine,
have collars ready and in place to have
[SPEAKER_00]: the machine running and ready to be
loaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't take your cuttings and then get the
clone machine ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that's ready ahead of time so
you can put the collar on and stick them
[SPEAKER_00]: right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit more advanced to see
a root already popping out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that gives you just an idea of that
quick, easy transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cutting the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers will go through and cut all
the ends of the leaves, trim them all down
[SPEAKER_00]: to reduce the area and transpiration rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally don't advise this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I discourage this only because
it increases the wound sites and can
[SPEAKER_00]: increase potential for disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the cloning environment has high
humidity, the leaf cutting is unneeded
[SPEAKER_00]: really.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also cause some other issues with
the plants kind of growing out and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: healing up those areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have enough of a humid environment,
you shouldn't need to cut the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidity, as I mentioned, is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I place the clones in a high humid
environment, looking at 95 plus,
[SPEAKER_00]: if taking multiple cuttings, be sure to
label them in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Color coding, labeling different trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that some labeling methods,
especially if you're using certain labels,
[SPEAKER_00]: they may fade in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind to keep an eye
on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're not using always the pink
and the light blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those may fade over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watering them in really heavy can help
increase humidity and then placing a
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity dome if you're looking at a tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consistency is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep the clones evenly moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is consistency and to avoid
excessively wet and dry pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want a nice, fine mist over the area,
over that leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're growing in a little bit
larger of an area, you can have a monitor
[SPEAKER_00]: here to make sure you're maintaining a
certain percent of the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones perform best in 18 to 24 hours of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diffused light provides energy for growth
but reduces the chance of them burning
[SPEAKER_00]: this tender foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Direct high density light is not advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluorescence are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warm and cool light is preferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work rate for clones, run about 6 to 10
inches away from the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: High power light, high pressure sodiums,
metal halides can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have shade cloth between them or just
hang them about 5 feet away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dimmable lights are another great source.
[SPEAKER_00]: They offer the advantage of changing
intensity as the clones develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: After 4 days, you can reduce humidity
levels to about 85%.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be accomplished by partially
removing the domes or reducing automatic
[SPEAKER_00]: misting events.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still want that kind of humid
environment but we're starting to ease
[SPEAKER_00]: them off from that 95% or higher humidity
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once roots are seen through the media or
have reached about 6 inches long,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can be transferred to their growing
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can take anywhere from 7 to 21 days
and depending on the environment that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some clones may be slower to initially
root and those should not be transferred
[SPEAKER_00]: until sufficient roots have been produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here some might be on the
borderline edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to let this go for a couple
more days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not simply take a block or a tray of
clones and progress them to the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat them as each individual to help
increasing the higher percent total that
[SPEAKER_00]: will survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the initial transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be some color change which is
normal due to transplant shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: As clones age, the light intensities can
be increased and the duration of photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period should be kept consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't panic if you go to transfer them
and all of a sudden they get a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter in coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: They usually will bounce back if
everything else is kept well established
[SPEAKER_00]: and consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers are going to problem of over
fertilizing and burning their tender roots
[SPEAKER_00]: of their newly cloned plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: To summarize these 13 steps, I'm all kind
of quickly labeled right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pause the video and take a look at
it in more detail with everything they
[SPEAKER_00]: went over to hopefully have a successful
cloning process.
Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
