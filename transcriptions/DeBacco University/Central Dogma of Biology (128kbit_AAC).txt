[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is a very short video here
going over the central dogma of biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three main steps, replication,
transcription, and translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of just giving you an idea of
the bigger picture and putting all the
[SPEAKER_00]: parts together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So DNA can replicate, and that's
generating more DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA can also go through the process of
transcription, where it's written
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could think of this as DNA being
written as RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being written differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember thiamine is present in DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a cell in RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're translating our RNA sequence to
something completely different,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, a protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this process here of replication,
transcription, and translation is what's
[SPEAKER_00]: called the central dogma of biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be very familiar with each of
these terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a little bit more detail for each.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA, making more DNA is going to be
replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's producing identical copies,
and that's key for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transcription is DNA being converted to
RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the opposite of that we call reverse
transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going from RNA to DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some viruses may do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The telomerases at the end of our
chromosomes go through this reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription, and that's going from RNA
to DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Translation, think of translating a
different language, is the conversion of
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA to a protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, that reverse transcription
phase is basically going backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, we think of going from DNA to
RNA to a protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the central dogma here,
this presents it in a slightly different
[SPEAKER_00]: format.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the same terms used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Replication, transcription, translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, moving from DNA to RNA to a
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are special cases where we can kind
of skip certain steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain viruses may want to go backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be a DNA base.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might want to go to make RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reverse transcription and other things
in the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene expression is the use of information
in DNA to direct the production of
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: This occurs in two stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: Changing of the letters, think of it as
writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In transcription, you're actually writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In translation, it's conversion to another
language.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nucleotide language to amino acids is a
way to think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going from our DNA to our RNA to
ultimately our protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing is shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our double-stranded DNA being
transcribed to RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that's RNA because of uracil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's being translated now to a
sequence of amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is a very short video on the
central dogma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be familiar with the various terms used,
such as replication, transcription,
[SPEAKER_00]: and translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And reverse, we look here, we also want to
keep the idea of the reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this makes a little bit more
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be able to recognize these terms and
provide definitions for them, which we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: go into more detail in other lectures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
