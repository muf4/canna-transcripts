[SPEAKER_00]: I have yet to find a farm that is free of
problems, but what separates some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: more successful farms from the less
successful ones is how they manage her
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you can't plan for everything,
some things can be managed for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you can have a plan in place to
help reduce the problems or the impact
[SPEAKER_00]: that it may have in your operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's come back to just planning ahead
for some of the common or expected
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see here we got powdery mildew on
squash, late and early blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tomatoes, leafhoppers on potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, there's more than just disease
issues to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to think about insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to think about some other impacts
that could happen, such as staking and
[SPEAKER_00]: wind or weather-related things,
animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's more than just disease issues
that we need to plan for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Planning ahead for some common or expected
problems, I said squash and powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost a guarantee you're going to get
that, especially later in the season at
[SPEAKER_00]: FruitSet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomatoes, early blight for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully not late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Late blight, irrigation in some instances
for certain fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potatoes, you have the leafhoppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carrots, if you're growing carrots,
you're doing some form of weeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to have in place?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use flame weeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to use solarization.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to handpick.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to go through and do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Broccoli, animals, you get the woodchucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I show here, I know this doesn't
relate exactly to growing, but when it
[SPEAKER_00]: snows, are you ready with a snow blower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have chains to go on the tires?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you planning ahead for this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have it snow and then,
oh, realize like you've never seen snow
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have, again, an idea in place
and the equipment ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Problems and general solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is just a quick kind of
one-hit summary here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a fungus problem, you use
fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacteria, bactericides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Virus, you want to use vector prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, viruses come in with insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to prevent the insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrient and balance, you want to do a
soil test so you can have an idea what's
[SPEAKER_00]: low, what's high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water, know your field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the wet spots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are the dry spots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Insects, there's many options with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animals, usually a physical barrier works
the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental, there's only so much you
can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And grower error, look in the mirror for
who to blame.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make a mistake, but you can only
make it once.
[SPEAKER_00]: For disease management, prevention is step
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to apply a corrective
spray, read the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's chemical and organic options for
spray products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless, rotations need to be
considered, whether using organic or
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical means.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Benjamin Franklin's quote here.
[SPEAKER_00]: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of
cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can try to prevent the disease from
occurring with maybe increasing plant
[SPEAKER_00]: spacing so there's more air circulation,
planting not where there's a wet portion
[SPEAKER_00]: of the field can really save you a lot
later in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: For insect management, as I said,
they're highly variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they lack in size, they come out for
in numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little leafhopper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very small insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a field I visited with
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this is advanced, advanced,
severe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would call hopper burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the leafhopper is doing major damage
to this crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, unless the potato's grown here
not too far over, we really haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: touched these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still potatoes, so different varieties can
be favored by some insects versus others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Applying a physical barrier is a great way
and really the only form of 100% control.
[SPEAKER_00]: For insects, you're separating that with
basically a screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming there's a good seal with the
ground and the wind's not blowing it up,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's also no tears in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it does work 100%, that is if
it's 100% installed properly and 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have a tear in it and
have the insects get in and then be
[SPEAKER_00]: trapped on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can cause actually a worse situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also for insects, we want to consider good
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's beneficial insects that do show
promise, but timing is important for
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to also provide habitat and find a
proper match that's important for these
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are very specific, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy them at various places online.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to get them shipped at the right
time and you want to release them and
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure you have a good environment for
those particular insects so they can be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to survive and seek out some of the
bad bugs that you may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also plant a trap crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where the perimeter planting,
you have that trap crop and you have your
[SPEAKER_00]: main crop on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to plant a variety of crop
that's favored by the target insect that
[SPEAKER_00]: would be on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, squash bugs like blue hubbard
squash and some other different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: squash varieties are very good selections
to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd suggest that you start about three
weeks prior to planting of your summer
[SPEAKER_00]: squash, winter squash, cucumber,
cantaloupe, or watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So timing, again, you want to put the trap
crop out early so that the insects find
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit more mature and that's
what you're going to monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can really reduce the impact on
your main crop because you're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: control the insects or monitor the insects
at the perimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could prevent them from getting to
your main crop or basically not spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: your main crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be only spraying your trap crop
and many different options to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless, though, timing is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timing of planting can influence pressure,
whether you're planting early or late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also want to consider your neighbors,
what their timing may be as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone goes in really early, that can
increase insect pressure potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or really late in the season, certain
diseases could potentially come over on
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier or later plantings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like the baseball player here,
timing is important to hit the ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Internal combustion engines timing is a
big deal also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is really putting this all
together and getting the timing right and
[SPEAKER_00]: make it really easier as you go through
the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you miss your timing or don't plant
properly, you can be fighting that and get
[SPEAKER_00]: very frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this helps you develop at
least a little bit of an idea and put that
[SPEAKER_00]: plan together with a time frame and you
can be more successful as you grow this
[SPEAKER_00]: year and into next year.
