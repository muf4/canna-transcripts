[SPEAKER_00]: Okay here, I'm gonna give you a brief
overview of understanding the disease
[SPEAKER_00]: triangle that we see indicated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have three different components coming
together to triangulate and form the
[SPEAKER_00]: occurrence of disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the host or susceptible host is the
plant in this case and the pathogen is
[SPEAKER_00]: another word for the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: The environment are the conditions that's
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no disease when there's no
intersection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the host in a proper environment,
but there's no pathogen present at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing if you have the host and the
pathogen without favorable environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, you still will not get a
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when all three of these come
into intersection with one another,
[SPEAKER_00]: when all three of these are present at the
same time, you get this scenario that
[SPEAKER_00]: develops and this is where disease will
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: When all these intersect, that's where
you're getting that triangulation and that
[SPEAKER_00]: disease that forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There needs to be all three components
interacting for the occurrence of a
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: If only one is missing, then the triangle
will simply fall apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order, despite getting disease,
grossing is very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a combination of factors
that are all coming together at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time for that disease to occur and what
those environmental conditions may be,
[SPEAKER_00]: what that pathogen is, will be dependent
on the form or type of disease that's
[SPEAKER_00]: present, but still with the host,
the environment, and the pathogen all
[SPEAKER_00]: coming together at the same time,
that's where you get disease and upsetting
[SPEAKER_00]: this triangle can be a great way to offer
control and not allow disease to occur at
[SPEAKER_00]: a particular plant host here.
