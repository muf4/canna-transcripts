[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to investigate plant
hormones in the general sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just giving an overview of the impact
that certain ones can have.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see in the picture here,
hormones can impact plant behavior
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatically if used in the right amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hormones in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hormones are organic substances produced
in small amounts that regulate or
[SPEAKER_00]: coordinate metabolism growth in
morphogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple listed here which I'll
have separate videos on described in more
[SPEAKER_00]: detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cytokinins can induce the growth of the
shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxins can promote root initiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gibberellins can stimulate stem
elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And others can trigger blustering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to focus on this one too
much here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also going to go over abscisic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basic hormone processing just in the
general sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at a receptor that binds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they're small amounts, but they're
binding to a specific receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's signal transduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are relay molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of molecules activated can be
increased exponentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why hormones are needed in such
small amounts, because they can initiate a
[SPEAKER_00]: large response through relay molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: These relay molecules can then impact a
cellular response by affecting the DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: expression in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cellular activity is initiated indirectly
via the action of secondary messengers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice this small round molecule is able
to get through the pore of the nucleus and
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust the cellular response by adjusting
the gene regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have some different examples here
of different types of hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind there's two key categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lipid soluble hormones or steroid
hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give the details here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part is these are able to go
through the phospholipid bilayer and enter
[SPEAKER_00]: the inner part of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can directly initiate the production
of proteins within a target cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they easily diffuse that cellular
membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hormone cell is the binder receptor in
the cytosol.
[SPEAKER_00]: That forms a receptor hormone complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: The receptor hormone complex then enters
the nucleus, and that can bind to the
[SPEAKER_00]: target gene of the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transcription of the gene creates
messenger RNA that's then translated to
[SPEAKER_00]: the desired protein within the cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lipid soluble hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all considered steroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now other ones are water soluble hormones,
and they have a little bit of a different
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water soluble hormones can't diffuse
through the cell membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: These hormones must bind to a circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The surface membrane receptor then
initiates a cell signaling pathway within
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell involving proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: These protein kinases phosphorylate
proteins in the cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: This activates the proteins in the cell
that carry out the charges specified by
[SPEAKER_00]: the hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of an extra binding
site that needs to occur on the external
[SPEAKER_00]: surface, because water soluble hormones
can't go through the phospholipid bilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those lipids, remember those tails,
are hydrophobic, and they will repel that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these proteins need to bind to a
surface protein receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, steroid hormones are able to go
right through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water soluble ones need that extra
receptor binding complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: This then shows it again, the lipid
soluble hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here an example of animals would
be probably a little bit easier to relate
[SPEAKER_00]: to, but the same thing occurs in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lipid soluble can diffuse right through
the membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hormones bind to receptor in the
cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The receptor hormone complex enters the
nucleus and adjusting gene regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gene regulation is related to
transcription, ultimately translation,
[SPEAKER_00]: resulting in an activated protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water soluble hormones, on the other hand,
these need to bind to the exterior
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: These bind with the protein complex,
and you can see in a roundabout way,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are also producing activated
proteins, but they have a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: different pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: That protein kinase, activated protein
kinase, requiring ATP, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylation that's occurring is
generating the proteins within the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice here we're seeing transcription
translation with actual DNA and gene
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're kind of sidestepping the
nucleus, and we're just generating our
[SPEAKER_00]: activated proteins within the cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The five-meter classes of plant hormones
that we're going to be discussing are
[SPEAKER_00]: auxins, typically for shoot apical
meristems, and that's where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: typically found.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're for stimulongation, vascular
tissue, and lateral buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cytokinins, they're produced in the roots
and transported from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They interact with auxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stimulate cell division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gibberellins, they can be in apical
portions, and they're responsible for seed
[SPEAKER_00]: germination and internode elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethylene is in leaves and stems in young
fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It concerns abscission, which is the
dropping of leaves, the flowering of
[SPEAKER_00]: fruits, and fruit ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And abscisic acid in mature leaves and
root caps is where it's produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can suppress bud growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also important for stomatal opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you a quick overview of
hormones and their function and where they
[SPEAKER_00]: may be found at different sequences of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice for germination, only
gibberellins are really the most active,
[SPEAKER_00]: where when we look at flowering and fruit
development, pretty much everything but
[SPEAKER_00]: abscisic acid is involved in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Abscisic acid is key for seed dormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit for abscission with ethylene
also plays a role in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that just one hormone isn't
doing just one task.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can evolve in multiple different tasks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to learn about each of
these in a little bit more detail so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can appreciate some of the specifics that
these different hormones and their ratios
[SPEAKER_00]: and concentrations can impact plant
growth.
