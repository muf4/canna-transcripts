[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in growing media, there are organic
components that are added.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go through some of the common
ones that are added to growing media,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as peat moss, bark, coconut coir,
and worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some common organic additives to
growing media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, starting with peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't degrade easily, making it a
stable compound to incorporate into bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also acidify surroundings,
so that can be a concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times in growing media bags,
you'll see if peat moss is added,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll also see some form of lime also
added.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the peat moss comes from Canada,
as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the advantage is that it's free of
weed seeds, pests, and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can absorb up to 20 times its weight in
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is often the time why it's added to
growing media.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's naturally hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a downfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can need time to hydrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at when you initially
are working with growing media,
[SPEAKER_00]: if initially kind of the water kind of
sheets off and doesn't really incorporate
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you may have to slowly add some more
moisture to get this to slowly wet over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, peat moss comes from peat bogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is some concerns, because most
of it comes out of Canada, that with
[SPEAKER_00]: increased usage, this could be depleting
some natural peat bogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd take a very long time to replenish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another organic component is bark chips,
which is commonly pine bark.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find pine bark and pine bark mulch
example here in bags alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used typically on the top to dress up
gardens or flower beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be incorporated into growing
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why is it improves drainage and
keeps the weight of the final product down
[SPEAKER_00]: to a minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, it's often used as a top
dress for flower gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times, it is incorporated
into some growing media to help increase
[SPEAKER_00]: that porosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have coconut coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made from the middle portion of the
coconut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it needs to be treated before it can
be used for growing media to leach the
[SPEAKER_00]: salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's naturally high in salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are buying it for growing media,
sometimes it will come pre-washed,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages of coconut coir,
the reason why it is used so often,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that it is a renewable resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free of wheat seeds, pests,
and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only slightly acidic with a pH around
6 to 6.7 typically.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the downfalls to coconut coir is
that it is high in salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can require a long shipping distance to
the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because we see it being available,
to think about where that original product
[SPEAKER_00]: came from, and that's typically many,
many miles away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does require hydration before use to
get it to adequately absorb moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And quality can vary from batch to batch,
depending on the original source material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you're purchasing coconut
coir from the same company doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting it from the same source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there can be a great deal of
variability from one batch to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some limitations of coconut coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a need for extra additions of
calcium and magnesium products that will
[SPEAKER_00]: not be needed in the same amounts for
other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other basic materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people growing coconut coir typically
will get a CalMag type product that they
[SPEAKER_00]: need to supplement with to negate some of
the potential negatives that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with coconut coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly here, we have worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: These contain highly biologically active
products that are high in humus content.
[SPEAKER_00]: They contain nutrients to support plant
growth, but the total values are minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it does have nutrients,
overall it's kind of a minimal percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage is this is a near neutral
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a wide variety of uses with
minimal chance of burning the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can almost plant directly right in
worm castings and not burn the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is not true with some other even
organic materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, worm castings can be costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing in an outdoor
environment, so it's like in a lawn
[SPEAKER_00]: setting, if there's natural earthworms,
the plants can get this beneficial product
[SPEAKER_00]: for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the outdoor situations, typically
worm castings need to be added,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in container growing and soilless
media, it can be advantageous to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: bring in some of the benefits that outdoor
plants may enjoy to a container or indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: setting.
Thank you.
Thank you.
