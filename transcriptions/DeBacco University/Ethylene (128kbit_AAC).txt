[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we'll look at the plant hormone
ethylene, which you don't realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: this one you may have experienced with
before, even if you didn't realize it was
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular hormone that was doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start off with, ethylene plays a
role in fruit ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have an apple, it's acid and
sour, it's starch, a lot of chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_00]: and pectin, it's hard, and large
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we add ethylene, it can activate a
bunch of enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice all these in the ace indicating
that they're enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can develop a ripe apple now,
which is neutral in pH, has a lot of sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of starch, less chlorophyll,
less pectin, so it's softer and increased
[SPEAKER_00]: fragrance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice with our banana here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going from a green banana all the way
to a ripe banana to an overly ripe banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is showing an increase in ethylene
that is causing this ripening to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ethylene, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the smallest hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It typically exists as a gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important for seed germination,
fruit ripening, and abscission of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means leaves basically fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're noticing here our fruit ripening
stage of a fruit and our ethylene
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice in the green or unripe stage,
our ethylene production is quite low.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a large spike as we get closer to
ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at peak ripeness, we're noticing a
high amount of ethylene produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice a slow decrease over time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we notice that those where the fruit
is ripe, the ethylene is much higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: it is when it is unripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the functions of ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mentioned the abscission portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a rapid diffusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ethylene can work in the leaf here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The abscission's going to be the shedding
phase where the leaf is dropped off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethylene can actually block this kind of
line here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means block auxins from activating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice with a lot of hormones,
there's interactions between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to focus on just what
these specific hormones do or what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of known for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ethylene, because it's a gas,
can diffuse very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also affects adjacent individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we come up with this saying,
which you may have heard of, one bad apple
[SPEAKER_00]: spoils the bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is because one bad apple is going
to produce high amounts of ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ethylene is going to affect the
adjacent individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one bad apple is going to cause
the apples adjacent to ripen, which those
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to cause the ones adjacent to
another ripen, and then it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: spread throughout the entire barrel or
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go back here to senescence and
abscission.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the leaves, senescence is
where they're being broken down,
[SPEAKER_00]: and abscission is where they're actually
falling off the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's ethylene is involved in that
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the one bad apple spoils the
bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's because of ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: One bad apple is going to ripen all the
other apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this could be used to our advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever had a hard peach or unripe
bananas that you want to speed up the
[SPEAKER_00]: ripening, you may have heard you put them
in a brown paper bag and let them sit for
[SPEAKER_00]: a day or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will speed up the ripening process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brown paper bag is trapping in the
ethylene, causing that fruit to ripen a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the brown paper bag is something you
might have put fruit in and miraculously
[SPEAKER_00]: they come out and they're softer,
especially peaches and nectarines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's because of the ethylene
production that's being kept in a closed,
[SPEAKER_00]: confined area, speeding up the ripening
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly with ethylene, there's something
called a triple response.
[SPEAKER_00]: This triple response indicated here we
have zero ethylene concentration in parts
[SPEAKER_00]: per million and we're slowly increasing
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, all hormones work in very
small quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here the triple response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, ethylene can inhibit stem
elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice here as we're increasing our
concentration, the elongation of the stem
[SPEAKER_00]: is being reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stem is being thickened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare this stem diameter to this stem
diameter, the highest ethylene
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, third part of the triple
response, horizontal growth of the stem as
[SPEAKER_00]: the concentration of ethylene increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here, we're seeing upright
growth with no ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we're increasing the ethylene,
we're noticing that stem is slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to bend to the side there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also thickening and we're noticing
the leaves are being different maturation
[SPEAKER_00]: rates there also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hormones, despite their very small size
and typically very small concentrations,
[SPEAKER_00]: can have a large influence on plant
behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
