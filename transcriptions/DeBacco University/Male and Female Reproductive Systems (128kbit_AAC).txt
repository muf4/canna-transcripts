[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at a brief
overview of the male and female
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductive systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with male and female,
we're looking at how is sex determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in mammals, sex is determined early
in embryonic development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early on, embryo gonads are indifferent,
neither male or female.
[SPEAKER_00]: The presence of a Y chromosome will
convert the gonads into testes,
[SPEAKER_00]: defining a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here where the female gametes
are two Xs, males are an X and a Y,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Y is important for converting the
gonads into testes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though there's not many genes encoded
on the Y chromosome, that's one very
[SPEAKER_00]: important and that's a defining
characteristic of males.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the size comparison of the Y to the
X chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in some animals, for example,
reptiles, the sex of the offspring is
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see in these graphs here and also this
nice representation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This example here, if the temperature is
cool or very warm, the offspring here will
[SPEAKER_00]: be dominantly male.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the temperature happens to be in the
middle of these two ranges, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: these eggs will be predominantly female in
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the years you'll have an entire nest
be either male or female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the organism, the temperature
ranges, it can influence the percentage of
[SPEAKER_00]: males that will hatch from these eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at, we're going to look at
some of the specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're unfamiliar with meiosis,
you might want to review this slide here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that we're starting with a
diploid cell and we're resulting in
[SPEAKER_00]: haploid cells in the end and there's a
meiosis one and a meiosis two that does
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may want to review this slide just
to refresh yourself with this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking now at the male reproductive
organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The testes produce sperm and testosterone
and they're enclosed in a hanging sack
[SPEAKER_00]: called the scrotum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part here is the reason why
they're located externally in the body is
[SPEAKER_00]: sperm need cooler temperature to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here for males trying to
conceive, males are typically suggested
[SPEAKER_00]: not to wear tight underwear or skinny
jeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're instead suggested to favor boxer
shorts and loose pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this allows to have happen is the
scrotum and the testes to hang outside the
[SPEAKER_00]: body and remain at a cooler temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cooler than body temperature will
increase the survival of the sperm and
[SPEAKER_00]: therefore increase the chance of
conception.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aspermatogenesis, the formation of the
sperm actually in the testes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind we're starting with this
diploid cell and ultimately we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be producing four viable sperm cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you a little bit of the details
of what the sperms will look like but I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to focus on this too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this lecture series, this is only a
brief overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the female reproductive organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the ovaries being the
primary female reproductive organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is female gametes or the ova.
[SPEAKER_00]: They secrete the female sex organs,
estrogen and progesterone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see here the ovary and the
fallopian tubes in the uterus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important for fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever heard the term caviar,
this is basically fish eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a collection from sturgeon which
is very rare and delicacy and very
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a collection of those female
eggs that are unfertilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at the events to generate
these eggs, what's interesting is that
[SPEAKER_00]: before birth, female eggs will be arrested
or paused in pro phase 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're confused what pro phase 1 is,
you might want to go back and review the
[SPEAKER_00]: myosis review slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondary oocyte are arrested in meta
phase 2 and is ovulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're penetrated by a sperm,
secondary oocyte completes myosis 2,
[SPEAKER_00]: giving them one large ovum which is the
functional gamete and a tiny second polar
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this sequence of events that
occurs before the sperm may enter the egg
[SPEAKER_00]: and after the sperm may enter the egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're having this kind of primary
oocyte and this breakdown of these polar
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very different in comparison to
the formation of the sperm as we saw
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then providing a direct example of the
two, oogenesis we're starting with that
[SPEAKER_00]: diploid cell, ultimately producing only
one viable ovum.
[SPEAKER_00]: These small polar bodies while haploid are
not really functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Primary spermatocyte, we're having that 2N
diploid produce four viable sperm in the
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important that for every diploid
cell, producing those four viable sperm
[SPEAKER_00]: versus in oogenesis, we're only producing
one viable ovum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the ovary and the formation of an
ovum.
[SPEAKER_00]: At birth, female ovaries contain all the
oocyte she'll ever produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at birth, every female has all the eggs
they'll ever have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 2 million oocytes and they're
arrested or paused in pro phase 1 of the
[SPEAKER_00]: first metodic division.
[SPEAKER_00]: But her egg cells are called ova,
or similar ovum, and this cycle is
[SPEAKER_00]: repeated about every 28 days while one is
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at birth, which is kind of hard to
think about, about 2 million oocytes are
[SPEAKER_00]: present in every female and those are the
eggs she'll have with her for her entire
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the fertilization process occurs when
the egg is in the fallopian tubes here and
[SPEAKER_00]: a sperm will meet that egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only one sperm is allowed to pass and
penetrate the oocyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fertilized egg will now be called a
zygote.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's transferred ultimately to the uterus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this transportation process may take
about five to seven days to reach the
[SPEAKER_00]: uterus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll attach to the wall and this is where
the zygote will then form into the fetus
[SPEAKER_00]: and develop into a baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to remember that
fertilization can only occur in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fallopian tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time it reaches the uterus at this
point, it'll attach to the wall if it is
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilized and the baby will develop from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this gives you a brief overview
and a little bit more of the detail of
[SPEAKER_00]: male and female reproductive systems.
Thank you.
