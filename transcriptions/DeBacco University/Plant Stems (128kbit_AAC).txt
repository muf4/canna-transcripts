[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at plant
stems in a little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought this was kind of an interesting
image to show here of some of the tree
[SPEAKER_00]: trunks from a different angle showing the
stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to learn a little bit more
about them, more than just trees,
[SPEAKER_00]: but how there's different types of stems
to depend on different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: classifications of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the stems in general,
they often experience both primary and
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, primary is growing upwards and
downwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondary growth is the growth in the
diameter of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stems are the source of the economically
important product, called wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the primary growth of a shoot,
leaves first appear as primordia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to quiz you on all the
individual little tiny terms here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I figure it's worth putting on a good
picture kind of to describe some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the leaf primordium here is G,
that's kind of off to the side here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's where the leaves are
initiating.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our highest rate of cell division
here at E, and that's the apical meristem
[SPEAKER_00]: that you should be familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: B is the ground meristem here,
and C is the leaf gap evident here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just familiarize yourself with this
microscopic look at a stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit more of a macroscopic view
that you might be a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with, the stem anatomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nodes, this is the area where our leaves
are originating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Internodes is simply the distance between
two nodes, the blade, or the leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the petiole, which is the support
supporting structure that supports the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf or the blade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be familiar with the stem anatomy
to be able to recognize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be doing some activities where you
have to identify certain stems and leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this video might prove helpful in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hypo and epicotles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the epicotle and the hypocotle all
are in relation to the cotyledon leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see this is clearly a dicot,
because there's two seed leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the stem region below those two seed
leaves is called the hypocotle,
[SPEAKER_00]: hypo meaning below or under.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hypocotle is underneath those two
cotyledons, and the epicotle is above
[SPEAKER_00]: those two cotyledons or seed leaves in
this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I ask you to identify the epicotle
or something with the hypocotle,
[SPEAKER_00]: these would be the regions you'd be
looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to tissue patterns and stems,
we have monocotyledons stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are monocots, as you remember
from our grass blades, or our corn plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cross-section contains a more scattered
approach than in dicots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found some excellent online,
some excellent microscopic images,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can get appreciation for what these
stems actually look like in these
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking monocots, we're talking
stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce no secondary vascular tissues
or cork.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say more scattered, our vascular
patterns are more scattered, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: you may initially say that the estrus is a
little bit more towards the perimeter,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is true, but they are definitely
more scattered when you compare to the
[SPEAKER_00]: dicots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what the stem would look like
in a monocot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at herbaceous dicotyledon stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, herbaceous are not going to
produce any form of wood structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So herbaceous dicotyledon stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have discrete vascular bundles,
and they're located mainly on the
[SPEAKER_00]: perimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll notice the pith in the middle
here, and all the vascular bundles are
[SPEAKER_00]: located on the perimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: To go back for one moment at the monocots
here, notice that yes, there's a more
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration towards the perimeter,
but they are scattered on the interior as
[SPEAKER_00]: well within the pith.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you see here with the herbaceous
dicots, they are only in the perimeter of
[SPEAKER_00]: the stem in these cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cortex, the epidermis, remember that's
the outer portion, and our vascular
[SPEAKER_00]: bundle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we zoom in our vascular bundle,
we notice here that we have on the top,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have our phloem, and then as we work
our way down, we have our xylem there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the middle is our vascular cambium
here, producing phloem to the outside and
[SPEAKER_00]: xylem to the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's a pretty good images that I
found online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Links are in the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you dicotyledon stems?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are dicots that are producing
wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heartwood and sapwood are two examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into these in a little bit
more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, produces secondary xylem,
which is wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Older trees have visually distinctive
sections here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the heartwood is a darker wood,
the inner wood in the center, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: located in this region right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sapwood is located towards the
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains still functioning xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here this lighter portion is the
sapwood.
[SPEAKER_00]: The annual ring marks are lines that are
between dark latewood and lighter
[SPEAKER_00]: earlywood, and that's what's causing the
annual rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use these rings to determine a
little bit of history of what this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular tree had gone through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see I took a little arrow here and
just kind of pointed one of the annual
[SPEAKER_00]: rings there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at a microscopic view,
we have the primary xylem here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside, the pith in the direct center,
the wood region here, which is made up of
[SPEAKER_00]: the secondary xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the vascular cambium,
again, where our phloem and xylem are
[SPEAKER_00]: being produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be considered in general the
bark region, and our phloem would be here
[SPEAKER_00]: on only the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave the example of people who go around
and particularly in areas that get a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of snow and don't want to cut down trees
to dry them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to leave them standing timber.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will go around, they'll cut into the
entire circumference of the tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: still leaving the tree vertical,
but what they do is when they cut into
[SPEAKER_00]: that with a saw, they're breaking all the
phloem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're eliminating all of the sugar
transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: By eliminating the sugar transport,
that tree will eventually die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, it will dry out, and in the
winter, while there's snow on the ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can go through and cut down those
trees because they're dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a wood stove or no one that
does, you don't want to freshly cut a tree
[SPEAKER_00]: down and burn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will produce a lot of smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of sap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't burn very efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having dry wood is definitely much more
advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: By cutting just the phloem and leaving the
tree standing, it's easy to find the trees
[SPEAKER_00]: in a thick snowpack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also dries the wood out so it burns
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, comparison between dicots and monocot
stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to do a quick division here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These would be the dicots here on the
left, and this would be the monocots here
[SPEAKER_00]: on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that much more scattered
approach in monocots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dicots, definitely keeping those vascular
bundles towards the perimeter only,
[SPEAKER_00]: having a large central pith region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zoomed out a little bit, so not just
looking at one portion here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see our monocots and our dicots again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, those vascular bundles in both
cases contain xylem to the inside and
[SPEAKER_00]: phloem to the outside, but we see the
dicots organized all along the perimeter
[SPEAKER_00]: and monocots scattered throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you that kind of a cartoon kind of
representative image of our dicots and
[SPEAKER_00]: monocot stems, this is how they would
look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see very much the same,
like the quality microscopic images that I
[SPEAKER_00]: chose to present earlier.
