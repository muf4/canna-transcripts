[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at the
coordination of secretion and absorption
[SPEAKER_00]: in relation to the human body digestive
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, secretion, we can look at the sundew
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This secretes this clear, very sticky
substance that helps trap insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: In absorption, we can think of the sponge
absorbing water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, looking first at secretion,
we have secretin, and this is released
[SPEAKER_00]: when chyme arrives in the duodenum and
increases the secretion of bile and
[SPEAKER_00]: buffers by the liver pancreas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here's our duodenum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, we just have left the stomach,
and this secretin is starting a cascading
[SPEAKER_00]: of events here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's chyme, remember, that's coming out of
the stomach, and this is going to bring in
[SPEAKER_00]: or stimulate bile to be produced by the
liver and enter into the small intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, at the same time, CCK, or
cholecystokinin, will be released,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is secreted also in the duodenum,
which is the early part of the small
[SPEAKER_00]: intestine when chyme contains lipids and
partially digested proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, help accelerate pancreatic production
and secretion of digestive enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body doesn't want to waste time
producing enzymes it doesn't need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cholecystokinin here, CCK, will signal the
pancreas to release the enzymes to help
[SPEAKER_00]: break down these food items that are
determined to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rejecting bile and pancreatic juice into
the duodenum will also be another role of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we can look here again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our food, here's our stomach,
here's our intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pancreas, liver, these are all kind of
coming together here, and the intestine
[SPEAKER_00]: releases, secreted, and cholecystokinin,
stimulating the secretion of pancreatic
[SPEAKER_00]: juice in bile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, secretion means to kind of release,
and that's going to be in the early part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the small intestine to allow the
absorption, which is the very next topic
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about, to occur over the vast
majority of the rest of the digestive
[SPEAKER_00]: tract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, looking just at that absorption in
general, it takes about five hours for
[SPEAKER_00]: materials to pass from the duodenum to the
end of the ileum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The movements of the mucosa increase
absorptive tetanus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what's occurring within the body?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're absorbing a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we can see here the main part,
absorbing the nutrients and water to blood
[SPEAKER_00]: vessels and lymph vessels, and this occurs
mainly in the small intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, also during this process,
we're having stirring and mixing of the
[SPEAKER_00]: contents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water to blood vessels is occurring mainly
in the large intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the body is absorbing not only
nutrients, but also water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to do this to maintain hydration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, most of our absorption
is occurring in the small intestine here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's approximately 19 and a half feet,
and for the large intestine, it's shorter,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is being mainly used here for
water reabsorption.
