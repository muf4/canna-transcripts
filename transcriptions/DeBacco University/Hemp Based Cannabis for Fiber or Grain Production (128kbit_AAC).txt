[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're investigating hemp-based
cannabis for fiber and also grain
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking more at a little bit of a large
or industrial scale here, hemp production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, when we're looking at
producing it for grain and fiber here,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be highly mechanized because we
are looking at a large scale here with the
[SPEAKER_00]: labor demands per acre, similar to that of
other agronomic crops, except for wheat
[SPEAKER_00]: control and harvest operations,
which require relatively more time for
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we can mechanize harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a large area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're having this equipment so
you can be able to process those large
[SPEAKER_00]: volumes of plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at seed sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp used for fiber or biofuel or other
products grown about six to seven feet in
[SPEAKER_00]: height.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a very tall crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to produce long fibers for
industrial processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some varieties listed here that
have some validation based on some data
[SPEAKER_00]: for Nepal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nebraska conditions is the best
information that I could find here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you're looking at your
particular region, you might want to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to see if there's been any research done
on particular varieties for your
[SPEAKER_00]: particular climate or growing location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these hemp varieties, just in general,
should be certified as having less than
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.3% THC, so below that federal limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grain production tend to favor early
maturing varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking more for fiber
production, you want to tend to favor
[SPEAKER_00]: later maturing varieties to allow for an
increased cellulose concentration in yield
[SPEAKER_00]: as the season progresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Male plants do die off during the season,
and Monash's female varieties are
[SPEAKER_00]: generally preferred for industrial hemp
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep that in mind when you're
looking at planting or purchasing a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now planting for grain and fire
production, the whole planting process in
[SPEAKER_00]: general for grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grain production may be optimized with no
more than 150,000 plants per acre and
[SPEAKER_00]: sowing 20 to 30 pounds of seed per acre to
kind of get to that number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for fiber production, this is data
based on Europe, but fiber yields were not
[SPEAKER_00]: increased by having more than 182,000
plants per acre, and this plant density
[SPEAKER_00]: results in better quality fiber than with
higher planting densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a prime example there where more
plants aren't better per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to try to maximize your
production within that growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind that soil temperature
should be around 55 degrees Fahrenheit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and emergence is likely to be three to
five days after spring planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it should be about that 55.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's warmer than that, probably a little
bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's cooler than that, that may stunt
or reduce the rate of germination that you
[SPEAKER_00]: notice with your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now harvesting for that grain in fiber,
how do you go about that harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: process there?
[SPEAKER_00]: For grain, as with any grain crop really,
the proper harvesting, processing,
[SPEAKER_00]: transport and storage are critical to
prevent spoilage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also ensure the highest value for the
harvested grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: A grain drying facility is needed,
and grain drying should begin within an
[SPEAKER_00]: hour and a half of harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always good to have or make sure
you have the full process for said crop
[SPEAKER_00]: before you go through and plant it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drying can be done at 140 degrees
Fahrenheit with a continuous flow dryer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but grain temperatures should not exceed
100 degrees Fahrenheit to avoid the chance
[SPEAKER_00]: of toasting your crop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for fiber harvesting, hemp is usually
grown in windrow and cut for fiber
[SPEAKER_00]: production at about eight inches between
early bloom and seed set, when the lower
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves of the female plant begin to yellow
and baled at 12% moisture content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where kind of have an idea in
knowing your crop and checking the fields
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to hit that kind of peak time to
harvest if you're looking at fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the market for grain and fiber just in
general, again, it's always a little hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of gauge your particular market,
but it appears at least using 2019 as an
[SPEAKER_00]: example, the supply greatly exceeded the
demand and hemp fiber and grain stock,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry, grain for feedstock prices plunged
during the 2019 season with specific
[SPEAKER_00]: regions getting hit harder than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So processors offer growers a profit share
agreement on the product when sold in
[SPEAKER_00]: place of outright purchasing of feedstock
at an agreed price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, again, this is always a little
bit kind of a challenge with any sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: perishable crop or crop in general,
looking at demand versus supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if supply really kind of becomes very
high, demand might go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always good to kind of have an idea
what the realistic price will be,
[SPEAKER_00]: what it was in previous years in any sort
of data you can gain so you can make an
[SPEAKER_00]: educated decision, but it is a kind of
variable market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a guaranteed sell there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of this can come with agreements
growers may establish ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just keep that in mind that
with, again, any crop, you got to keep an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of the market so you can make sure
that it is profitable to use in your
[SPEAKER_00]: growing area.
So thank you very much.
