[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this Tobacco University video,
we're going to go over the FIM printing
[SPEAKER_00]: technique for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's go over the FIM technique,
which stands for FIM, I missed,
[SPEAKER_00]: printing method for cannabis production
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal of this technique is to create
multiple tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can kind of see that pictured here
quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This multiple tops is great if you're
looking at cloning, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's typically done when you're cutting or
topping a plant, but not really making a
[SPEAKER_00]: clean cut, because true topping would
eliminate this kind of center portion here
[SPEAKER_00]: and only allow for kind of like two main
branch points to kind of come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at multiple branching
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: As if the grower feels like they look back
and trying to get the topping,
[SPEAKER_00]: but kind of like missed that clean cut is
kind of kind of what the name implies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see here multiple kind of
points growing out, and this is why it can
[SPEAKER_00]: be good for cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this technique is not recommended
for autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're seeing some other examples
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why it's not recommended for
autoflowers is because it will delay plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This result in lost plant matter
production days, which will mean that for
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflowers, it will likely not reach its
full potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this technique is used on autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages will likely be mitigated by
the required increased of plant numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: required to make up the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you could do with autoflowers,
but not recommended simply because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: delay in time that's going to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that top section, that kind of portion
here, this is what it looks like just to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of give you an idea of what you're
kind of removing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When selecting a top to prune,
grower should be looking for a tip that
[SPEAKER_00]: has four full nodes and is developing a
fifth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look specifically at the small early kind
of branch points in the leaf cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of looking right down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically five to six nodes up on the
plant will allow for a maximum efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: when utilizing this technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant stem tip remaining will grow
back slowly into multiple new branch
[SPEAKER_00]: points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes there can be some discoloration
due to the physical damage of the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, something you really should not
be that concerned with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The timing of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at, you know,
when we go through and implement this
[SPEAKER_00]: technique, there may be no exact time,
but the general rule is start two to three
[SPEAKER_00]: nodes up the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not want to do it much earlier
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can result in a box like plant of
about two and a half feet wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tall, just to give you a general idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might depend on your strain,
your variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be growing and also the
conditions, how quick you're flipping them
[SPEAKER_00]: over into flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just kind of gives you an idea of
kind of what you're looking for when
[SPEAKER_00]: topping and kind of this thinning
technique, because it is a modified
[SPEAKER_00]: version of topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what if you bend and then thin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers actually take the plants,
bend them, because we can see here at 90
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees and then thin their plants to
maximize the plant space.
[SPEAKER_00]: While minimizing the overall plant height.
[SPEAKER_00]: This technique can also produce many
growing points that can allow for
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient production of plant material,
particularly for cloning purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you're taking the bending
portion, growing this portion out and then
[SPEAKER_00]: thinning other portions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, to get more branch points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinning is part of a complete pruning
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thinning can be used in conjunction
with other pruning methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think just because you're thinning,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can utilize it or correlate it with
other techniques often used with the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen of green, because you're trying to
get those multiple branch points going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother plants for cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, again, as I said, a modified
version of topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of shows a good example of
taking the same plant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to thin the plant,
you'd cut it right here level.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were topping the plant there,
you'd cut it lower here, closer to where
[SPEAKER_00]: that actual branching leaf petiole nodes
kind of come into intersection there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, thinning, we're going to cut it
up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Topping, we'd cut it lower than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we're looking at the plant hormone
shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're looking at the plant
hormone shifts associated with the
[SPEAKER_00]: thinning technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cut results in many new growing tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of looks like a zoomed in
version here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if we were topping, we'd be cutting
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thinning, we're up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's allowing these multiple little
branch points to kind of grow out,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is great for having these new
maristems, new areas that could be used
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly for cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're looking at that screen of
green method where you kind of need a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of these little branch points to kind of
go through and work your way through the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen, this is another way that it could
be implemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this gave you some good
information about the thin technique for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
