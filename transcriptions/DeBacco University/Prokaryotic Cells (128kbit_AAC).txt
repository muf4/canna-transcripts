[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to talk about prokaryx
cells, which are very simple cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice on the inside, not very complex
structures, kind of a mess of DNA here
[SPEAKER_00]: located in the middle, no membrane-bound
organelles, no high degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are considered very basic or
primitive cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting off with simple organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're simple because they lack those
membrane-bound organelles.
[SPEAKER_00]: No distinct internal compartments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are found in eukaryotic cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see a nucleus, that's going to be a
eukaryotic cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the DNA in these cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean they don't contain DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still do, but it's not encapsulated
in a nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here, it's for movement, the
flagellum, for locomotion, thread-like
[SPEAKER_00]: structures protruding through the cell
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli bacteria is an example of a prokaryx
cell, magnified, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10,000 times, just to give an idea what
they may look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, basic components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at defining characteristics,
you get no membrane-bound organelles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the flagella here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This area here kind of looks like a bunch
of noodles kind of convinced here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nucleoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our DNA basically located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get no nucleus in prokaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do they kind of compare here of
our eukaryote?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are more membrane-bound organelles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prokaryotes are actually two categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not just bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We typically will associate with them as
bacteria, and they are, but archaea is
[SPEAKER_00]: another type of prokaryotic cell,
and they live in extreme habitats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example here, kind of that Yellowstone
National Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bright color here is because of
archaea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very stressful conditions here,
and we're able to tolerate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's structurally similar,
but biochemically different than some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bacteria and archaea both fall under
this line of prokaryote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the archaea, the bacteria, and the
eukarya, we're going to kind of leave
[SPEAKER_00]: these for another section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just focusing on these two, these are both
prokaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Key part here for differences,
I'd be looking at gene structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both circular chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll look at the eukarya that contain
those kind of defined organelles,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is looking at the interior cell
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no membrane-bound organelles or a
nucleus in both archaea and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several other differences,
but these are kind of the main two looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Structure of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three basic layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plasma membrane is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be an extensive video on this,
but just notice the plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lipid bilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two layers containing lipids, which is
fats with embedded and peripheral
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins, and those form the internal
pouches and allow for cell recognition,
[SPEAKER_00]: for communication, for exchange of
nutrients, losing of waste products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this plasma membrane here that's
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's a cell wall that maintains
the shape of the cell, and it's translated
[SPEAKER_00]: by this thing called peptidoglycan and the
glycocalis, which is basically a sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glyco referring to glucose, and the calyx
referring to just a coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a layer of polysaccharides on the
outer portion of the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well-organized and resist removal from the
capsid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This area here is peptidoglycan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see these kind of big macromolecules
kind of joined together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an example of a structure for
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another video I have on gram scanning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go over some of this more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Structure of bacteria, how do we get the
shape?
[SPEAKER_00]: Spherical shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cocci here, coccus, bacillus,
and spirulium here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different types of shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use these to help identify certain
bacteria structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gram stain is important in helping
identify these are examples of gram stain,
[SPEAKER_00]: how we can look at the shape of different
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain structures of the cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cytoplasm is semi-fluid solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains water, inorganic and organic
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enzymes are located there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is a eukaryotic cell,
but just to give you an idea of where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: located.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nucleoid in our prokaryotes is a region
that contains a single circular DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we say a circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of folded on itself,
so it's not a perfect circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we were to kind of unfold this,
it is in the circular form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus the chromosomes that would be found
in eukaryotic cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plasmids are small, accessory,
extra-chromosomal rings of the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are true circles, and they
typically are smaller than the total
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, DNA, or genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, structure of the cytoplasm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see where everything is located,
since certain are labeled here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that DNA here, kind of that circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is kind of folded on itself,
but it is still a circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Structure of the appendages of these
prokaryotes, flugella provide the
[SPEAKER_00]: motility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they can have one flugella or many.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both serving the same purpose to
be able to move the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fimbri are small bristle-like fibers
that sprout from the cell surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their purpose is to enable cells to
adhere to animal tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different than cilia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of students confuse them with
cilia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like these kind of protrusions
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are specifically allowing them to
adhere to animal tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cilia are used for locomotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prokaryotes use flugella for their primary
form of movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sex pylites are another type of structure
that's on prokaryotes, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're these kind of structures that
allow DNA to pass from cell to cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if this plasmid is
advantageous for the environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: example, it could be antibiotic-resistant
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these bacteria can communicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pylous here joins the two bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plasmid is replicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is passed through this pili.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this other bacteria now has,
for example, resistance to a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: antibiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bacteria then can proliferate and
basically take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how we get the formation of
antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just a quick overview of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a prokaryote cell, again, can identify
some of the certain parts, look at some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the certain structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I highly recommend you compare
prokaryotes to eukaryotes and see the
[SPEAKER_00]: similarities, but also the differences
between the two.
