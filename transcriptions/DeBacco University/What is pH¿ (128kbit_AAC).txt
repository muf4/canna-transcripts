[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is a term that gets tossed down
a lot, and that's pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I check your pH,
what's the pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: pH went up, went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look here at exactly what
is pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the definition is it's the measure
of molar concentrations of hydrogen ions
[SPEAKER_00]: in a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of determines whether it's an acid
or a base.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this measure kind of mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're measuring hydrogen ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a hydrogen ion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a hydrogen atom that has a
charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, a hydrogen ion has a
positive charge here, a cation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, hydrogen contains a proton and
electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it loses that electron, it becomes
just a proton, and here we have our
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen ion, and that hydrogen ion,
H+, cations, also usually just referred
[SPEAKER_00]: to, or sometimes, as just a proton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the scale of pH, it's measured from
zero to 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're under seven, that range of pHs
is considered acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven is considered neutral, and above
seven is the basic range, or alkaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, pH directly means potential of
hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scale is logarithmic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used to determine the acidity or
bases of a water-based aqueous,
[SPEAKER_00]: which aqueous stands for water-based
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also something called pOH,
and that's the potential of hydroxide,
[SPEAKER_00]: and while we typically focus on pH,
hydroxide's kind of like the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take pH two, and the pOH of that
would be 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we add them together, we get 14,
which is our scale here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're focusing on the hydrogen
ions here, the zero to 14 scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also pOH that works on the same
zero to 14 scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of just the opposite,
so you can kind of see related here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, our focus here is pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, acids and bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an acid is a substance that increases
the hydrogen ion concentration of a
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of lever shows here,
as the hydrogen ions increase,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH will decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So examples of tomato juice, grapefruit
juice, lemon juice, they have increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of hydrogen ions, therefore the pH
becomes lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bases are any substance that reduces the
hydrogen ion concentration in a solution
[SPEAKER_00]: that's defined as a base.
[SPEAKER_00]: That simply, those bases reduce hydrogen
ions directly by accepting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, examples of solutions that are
basic would be like baking soda,
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonia, and bleaches in drain cleaners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are much more in the base side,
or that pH below seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH neutral is seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a solution that's not acidic or
alkaline, such as pure water, pure H2O,
[SPEAKER_00]: that has a pH of seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see these universal indicators,
you know, colors that they may turn,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically around that green range would be
representative of a solution with a
[SPEAKER_00]: neutral pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH scale of that aqueous solution,
it's the measure of the hydrogen and
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroxide ions, measure of that zero to 14
degree, and most biological fluids are in
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH range of six to eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each pH unit represents a tenfold
difference in that scale's logarithm that
[SPEAKER_00]: we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means a small change in pH actually
indicates a substantial change in hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: and hydroxide ion concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can kind of see an example here,
the tenfold increase, we're moving that
[SPEAKER_00]: decimal place every pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see a large difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we may hear terms, something called
like strong acids or bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, strong acids and bases are ones that
completely dissociate in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see hydrochloric acid,
HTL, and that breaks apart into a hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: ion and a chloride ion completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strong base here, sodium and
hydroxide, we see the sodium and hydroxide
[SPEAKER_00]: completely breaking apart in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weak acids and bases, they only partially
break apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that they only partially break apart,
they can kind of flip back and forth,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what these arrows refer to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we see strong acids,
strong bases, weak acids, weak bases,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is just kind of giving you the
background of the kind of the chemistry
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going on behind these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have a acid and a base,
for example, a strong acid and a strong
[SPEAKER_00]: base, and mix them together in equal
proportions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should get pure water and salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that look like here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have hydrochloric acid and sodium
hydroxide, which I mentioned are both
[SPEAKER_00]: strong acids and strong bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll break apart into H2O and sodium
chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically water flipping back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where does the H2O come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the H here and H here,
that's the two H's in the oxygen forming
[SPEAKER_00]: water, and then the sodium and the
chloride forming here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of get salt water in an ideal
situation, mixing a strong acid and base
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the pH scale is a concentration of
hydrogen ions in a given substance,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the equation behind that is pH equals
minus the log, and these brackets mean
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of hydrogen ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this kind of look like,
kind of in a graphical representation
[SPEAKER_00]: here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well pH neutral of seven has equal amounts
of hydrogen ions and equal amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroxide ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we become increasing acidity,
we are working our way this way,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can see the percentage of our hydrogen
ions increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we become more basic, the hydrogen ions
decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember as I mentioned the pH we're
talking about from this standpoint,
[SPEAKER_00]: pOH would look at the opposite and that's
the hydroxide ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see how that changes as we shift
our pH from seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's just an example of why being
precise with pH is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much greater is the hydrogen ion
concentration in a solution with pH two
[SPEAKER_00]: than a pH with solution six?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at, this is only a
difference of four, but when we apply this
[SPEAKER_00]: to this equation here, pH minus the log of
the hydrogen ion concentration,
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing these two pHs that only differ
by four, well it's not just a difference
[SPEAKER_00]: of four points, it's actually a difference
of 10,000 times greater, or four decimal
[SPEAKER_00]: places greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because again, this is a
logarithmic scale, so that's why it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: important to maintain pH in a very tight
range, because if you don't, really bad
[SPEAKER_00]: things can happen in biological systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So allow these organisms to buffer
themselves on these pHs, what does a
[SPEAKER_00]: buffer mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it resists a change in pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may help organisms, particularly the
body, and also in plants, keep pHs within
[SPEAKER_00]: a narrow range.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are combinations of hydrogen ion
acceptors and donors to help kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the change that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take distilled water for an
extreme example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is our volume of sodium hydroxide,
this is a strong base added.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start at neutral pH, and we add the
ever slightest drop of sodium hydroxide,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we see the pH spike up immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have different levels of buffer,
different concentrations of buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see even adding a very small
amount of buffer will reduce the quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: changing pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher amount of buffer here,
we can see we maintain this pH pretty well
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent throughout all the different
volume of sodium hydroxide added here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this helps organisms maintain
life or homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're maintaining a very tight buffer
system for your blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is very important that your blood
stays in a very tight range of 7.34 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 7.38, that's normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH of seven to 7.8 is gonna cause some
issues, and if you reach as low as a pH of
[SPEAKER_00]: six or as high a pH of nine, it's gonna
result in death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily your body has ways of maintaining
this through buffers and other means,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can see just the importance of
maintaining pH knowing what it is and
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping it within a tight range to allow
organisms to grow and develop.
Thank you.
