[SPEAKER_00]: Here you're going to have the unique
opportunity to see nitrogen deficiency and
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicity in a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a trial that was conducted where a
plant was fed too much nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you see the toxicity and then
under fed nitrogen and that's where you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: see the deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the image here, this is the goal
of what we're trying to achieve here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nitrogen, we'll just start with the
basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do plants need it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they use it for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a mobile nutrient and that's
important when we look at where we start
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at on the plant where we might be
seeing toxicity or deficiency symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's necessary for amino acids,
nucleic acids, chlorophyll, coenzymes,
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole bunch of other things associated
with the components of plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen gives the plants that lush green
color while promoting succulent growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: hastens maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of giving that plant that
nice, what we've determined as growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a healthy green color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deficient plants exhibit what we call
chlorosis, which is loss of normal green
[SPEAKER_00]: color or yellowing of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excessive nitrogen can cause delayed
maturity, higher disease kind of issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: lower tolerance for environmental
stresses, reduced carbohydrate reserves,
[SPEAKER_00]: poor root development and difficulty to
clone as another negative effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: overfeeding nitrogen, not to mention
costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the trial that was conducted.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of the setup here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cultivar that was used was wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a high end CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant age is about 80 days old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was grown in a greenhouse to help
maintain consistent conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Control plants were fed a balanced
fertilizer and the test plant was either
[SPEAKER_00]: fed a deficient amount of nitrogen or a
toxic, super toxic to kill the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a bloated appearance as you're going
to see with the nitrogen that was over
[SPEAKER_00]: applied to those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the deficient plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important when we see leaves that
are yellowing, we notice where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: located.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over here in kind of those red circle,
we see that lower portion of the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: showing that yellowing color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lack of robust growth, a thin overall
appearance to the plant, poor green color
[SPEAKER_00]: even throughout the plant, but especially
in those lower leaves in slow growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking at just this image,
it's very hard to do that comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at this plant
compared to what be a normal plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see that control plant over on
this side here, that's how a plant should
[SPEAKER_00]: look if it was fed a balanced fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can really see that lack of vigor
in that test plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test plants also has a really yellowing
leaves on the older portions of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: or that lower portion of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this really now shows a nitrogen
deficient plant when you compare it to a
[SPEAKER_00]: normal plant the same age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to look for specifically, as I said,
those yellowing of the leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: notice how the upper leaves here as a
normal green color on the older leaves are
[SPEAKER_00]: yellowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a plant that's exhibiting kind of
a more advanced form of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that here that the green
color is being pushed to that newer
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because nitrogen is a mobile nutrient,
it's moving from the older and being
[SPEAKER_00]: translocated through the plant to the
newer growth that we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're growing tomatoes,
they kind of do the same thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: yellowing of those older leaves,
same symptoms as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was an extreme case where only the
very top of the leaves of the plant have
[SPEAKER_00]: much green color to them at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant is a very spindly look to it
in general as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seedlings can have early symptoms of low
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's yellowing of those older leaves
and that greening of the upper leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This problem should be corrected now to
avoid stress during the transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In field conditions, this can be more
common if after prolonged heavy rains,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in sandy soil that will flush
out a lot of that nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a hemp field here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bud regions, the upper portion is
green, but those lower regions,
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely that yellowing coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: If noticed only near harvest time,
near the end of the season, not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily a bad thing because you want
that last bit of nitrogen to push through
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a sign that you did not overfeed
those plants with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how to correct a problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a whole host of fertilizers are out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just kind of mentioned a couple here.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the advantage of just about all
nitrogen fertilizers is a very quick
[SPEAKER_00]: acting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically once added, watered into the
root zone, you should see a plant change
[SPEAKER_00]: in as little as three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the rates suggested here for about
a two by two growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have blood meal, urea, calcium nitrate,
and ammonium sulfate are the most common
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blood meal, one tablespoon per area,
corporate into the soil and watered in is
[SPEAKER_00]: key.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall is it is kind of costly,
but in three days you'll see the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: green up if you did have a nitrogen
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urea, three quarters of a teaspoon per
gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 46% nitrogen compared to blood
meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very concentrated source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can volatize or you can lose a lot of
that nitrogen to the air, if not
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporated into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, if you are making the
soil applications of urea, the soil should
[SPEAKER_00]: be warm, about 50 degrees Fahrenheit plus
or 10 degrees Celsius or greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium nitrate is 15 and a half percent
on nitrogen, one tablespoon per gallon of
[SPEAKER_00]: water, highly water soluble, but it can
increase the soil pH if used at high rates
[SPEAKER_00]: or over an extended period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be mindful of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, we have ammonium sulfate here,
21% nitrogen, half a tablespoon per gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: of water, reduces leaching and
volatilization, but it can acidify the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how to correct a deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what does a toxicity symptoms look
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens if you over apply your
calculations here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, looking at the over applications,
this is what a toxic level of nitrogen can
[SPEAKER_00]: look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have excessive growth, a very dark
green color to the leaves and brittle
[SPEAKER_00]: stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants can also be very difficult to
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here we see that very dark,
lush green growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how does that look compared to the
control plant, that same control plant
[SPEAKER_00]: from before?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can now see that comparison,
how much darker that green color is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a green door and a white wall in
the background kind of to kind of color
[SPEAKER_00]: balance things a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can definitely see that darker green
color with this excessive nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very dense canopy as well and that just
excessive growth there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the toxicity, how to correct that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, simply how to correct it is to know
what fertilizers you're adding and how
[SPEAKER_00]: much to add.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as growers, not to over add or if it
says a tablespoon, don't do one and then a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to calculate what you're adding
and learn what the normal plant and color
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like so that you know if you're over
adding or under adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned before, nitrogen is very
quick acting, which is great because if
[SPEAKER_00]: you do have a deficiency, you can easily
correct that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this helps you kind of
understand the nitrogen problems on the
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicity or on the divisions end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can check out other videos out in
this channel to help you understand
[SPEAKER_00]: potential deficiencies in your plants.
