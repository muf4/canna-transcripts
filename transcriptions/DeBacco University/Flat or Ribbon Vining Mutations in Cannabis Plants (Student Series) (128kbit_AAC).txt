[SPEAKER_00]: On this Tobacco University video,
we're going to look at another student
[SPEAKER_00]: series video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at flat or ribbon
vining mutations in cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go out to the greenhouse
bay, look at the variability you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: from using seeds, even though they're from
the same variety, some of the mutations
[SPEAKER_00]: that can develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Connor's going to walk us through just
what we're seeing out in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what we're seeing here is a few of
our mutations that we have in this bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole bay was from one cultivar,
one seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is our Bayox strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a high CBD variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in front of me, you can see a
healthy, normal looking plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: very uniform, Christmas tree like shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, no branches out of the ordinary,
nice, skinny, strong center branch stalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you take a look to my right and
you can see a stalk almost three to four
[SPEAKER_01]: times the thickness of our normal healthy
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very tall compared to our healthy
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another distinctive characteristic is this
big split in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did not top this in any form with
scissors or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think it's a mutation of some sort of
the main stem, almost like a conjoined
[SPEAKER_01]: twin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look over here on the left,
you see this monstrosity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very bushy tops, a stem that is almost
three to four times as wide as a normal
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see these big tufts of new growth on
the main stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you can see is that this leftmost
stem has actually started to curl and grow
[SPEAKER_01]: upside down at a 180 degree angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new growth is pointing downwards and
growing downwards as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another notable characteristic is how
skinny the stalk is on its side.
[SPEAKER_01]: On one angle, it's very wide and at the
other, it almost looks normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's some of our fun,
interesting, cool mutations that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing in our greenhouse currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
