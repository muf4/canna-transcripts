[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at integrated pest
management, which is abbreviated IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great kind of summary here
where this involves this integration of
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying and monitoring for casual
agents, evaluating based on those monitors
[SPEAKER_00]: of what's going on, trying to prevent some
of the pest problems from occurring,
[SPEAKER_00]: taking action when needed, and then
monitoring the end result to see if any
[SPEAKER_00]: part of this needs to be repeated again.
[SPEAKER_00]: IPM tools alter surroundings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can disrupt insect behaviors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that using pesticide is still
a part of integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't mean that's null and void,
but we try to use other things that may be
[SPEAKER_00]: less impactful on the environment as part
of this integration of managing of pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, IPM involves the use of this
combination of methods to control pests
[SPEAKER_00]: that results in minimizing environmental
impacts overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, chemical is used, but we're looking
at prevention being kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then cultural sanitation, physical,
mechanical, biological controls,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then chemical is kind of like a last
resort there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this can be applied to buildings and
homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be applied to the farms and
also manage natural systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this incorporation of data to then gain
information and knowledge and applying it
[SPEAKER_00]: to learning is a vital and important
component of this integrated pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what the guidelines are for IPM is
select the control, which will cause the
[SPEAKER_00]: least amount of impact on pests and
natural enemies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal here is to get the same end
result we want, but not really impacting
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment in other ways that we may
not see as great as some other chosen
[SPEAKER_00]: methods that might be employed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The controls used will have the least
potential harm to the environment overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we may want to control one,
for example, insect pest, we want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure the rest of the environment is as
minimally impacted as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call these guidelines just as we see
here, we see on TV shows, because this
[SPEAKER_00]: gives you just the general idea of what to
expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be specifically managed for
different pests we're trying to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the usage of IPM involves using a
wide range of pest control strategies,
[SPEAKER_00]: making decisions that requires good
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different possibilities,
but the goal is to try to have that proper
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That identification step is very important
because it can allow for specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: targeted ideas or strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant and pest characteristics are
important considerations as well to allow
[SPEAKER_00]: those to be as specific as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to encourage the plant growth
while disrupting plant growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduction to kind of get the end result
we want with minimal impacts on the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the benefits of IPM is to promote
sustainable agriculture, reduce pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: use overall, and lessen the chance of
pesticide resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is here we have before
pesticide application, we have this first
[SPEAKER_00]: generation, we have a spray control.
[SPEAKER_00]: After pesticide application, we see that
many of the insects were killed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's always a few that remain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next generation, we see an increase in
their same number, so we take that same
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide, we apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for whatever reason, these red bugs
have resistance, and we can see that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: building or encouraging that population,
essentially artificially selecting for
[SPEAKER_00]: that population.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is using this one straight chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're using this integrated pest
management, the goal is to try to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: this from occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduce the potential environmental
contamination of the pesticide,
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the residues on plants,
and also lessen the chance of insects
[SPEAKER_00]: developing this resistance to a particular
product so that we're managing them in an
[SPEAKER_00]: effective way while still maximizing plant
growth.
