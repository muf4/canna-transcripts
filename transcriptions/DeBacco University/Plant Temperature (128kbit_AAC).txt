[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at plant temperature,
certain plants are going to have different
[SPEAKER_00]: preferences for different temperatures,
but for the most part, most plants like
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent conditions within a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically plants can be, if they're too
cold, will slow down their metabolic rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: and plants have that ideal temperature,
but even it can get too hot for plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that even live in tropical environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hot air is better to a point,
and I stress this because photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: is most efficient at about 85 degrees
Fahrenheit, which is about 30 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius, under normal carbon dioxide
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this should be the maximum temperature
obtained under normal growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have net photosynthesis,
here we have temperature, and we could see
[SPEAKER_00]: increases to a point, but then as the
temperature increases, the actual net
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis will decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to try to stay as close
to this range as possible to maximize the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I say at normal CO2 levels,
myself up here, is that when the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: space is enriched with CO2, the
theoretical maximum temperature increases
[SPEAKER_00]: by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit to
almost 95 degrees Fahrenheit, or from 28
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Celsius to about that 35 or so
degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because of plants able to kind of
take in that carbon more effectively,
[SPEAKER_00]: able to not open their stomata as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a variety of factors, but under
increased CO2 levels, the plants typically
[SPEAKER_00]: can handle and prefer warmer temperatures,
and you'll see a net rise in
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic rate, but even then,
after a certain point, there will be a
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in the net photosynthesis,
even in enriched carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the minimum temperature target,
always keep your plants above 50 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit to help avoid stunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Below 55 degrees, plant metabolism slows
down dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: If plants experience 32 degrees Fahrenheit
or lower, they will freeze and burn,
[SPEAKER_00]: causing them to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if we get to 35, that's really going
to potentially do some damage,
[SPEAKER_00]: and definitely 32 and below will basically
kill the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, all plants have their
kind of optimal range that they want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: at, so again, for cannabis, we're
typically looking at that, maintaining
[SPEAKER_00]: right around that 75-ish degrees
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature consistency is another great
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to maintain the temperature in
a growth space within a close range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluctuations can lead to stress and
reduced growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's because the midday temperature is
just fine, you want to make sure it's
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly consistent through the entire day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The metronome here, that consistency,
that kind of back and forth, kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: regulating that nighttime temp to that
daytime temp, we can see the extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions here, where it's nice and warm
in the greenhouse, and there is snow
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to maintain those
consistent conditions to keep growth as
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient as possible, both day,
night, and through the entire grow season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
