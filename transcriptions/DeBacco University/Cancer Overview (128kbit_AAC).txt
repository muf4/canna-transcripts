[SPEAKER_00]: Here, I'm going to go over a brief cancer
overview to kind of give you a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of the background of what cancer is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, just starting with the basic question
of what is cancer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply put, it's an abnormal cell growth,
a neoplasia.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two different types, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a benign and a malignant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The benign is very slow growth,
non-invasive, and malignant is rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and be very invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The malignant is much greater concern than
the benign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a little comparison between the
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Benign, very minimal nuclear variations,
diploid, low mitotic count, cells remain
[SPEAKER_00]: specialized or organized, but they may
perform some admirable functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The malignant, because of their rapid
growth, they have variable nuclear
[SPEAKER_00]: variation, they range in ploidy,
they could be like a diploid, they could
[SPEAKER_00]: be haploid, they could be tetraploid,
all sorts of crazy things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low to high mitotic count, loss of
specialization of functions, lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: organization, often loses their function,
they're just growing out of control and
[SPEAKER_00]: malignant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A common question maybe asked is,
is cancer, can I get it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: inherit cancer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the majority of cancers are not
inherited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only about five to 10% of all cancers are
due to the inherited gene defect.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is caused by the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cancer is a genetic disease, but the
majority of the mutations that lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer are somatic, they occur in our
somatic cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're not going to pass those
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the five to 10%, cancers that do
occur for genes include a couple here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the environmental factors here,
and you can see how tobacco products,
[SPEAKER_00]: diet, infections, obesity, alcohol,
all contribute to 90 to 95% of all
[SPEAKER_00]: cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What causes cancer is mutations that lead
to cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have viruses, bacteria, chemicals,
UV light, all these can have different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cancers associated with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they all have something in
common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here would be our normal cells,
and we're noticing our cancer cells are
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like growing out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice kind of that loss of
specialization, that loss of organization
[SPEAKER_00]: that's occurring with cancer, it's
abnormal cell growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there's a whole host of
potential sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just UV light, it's not just
viruses, it's not just chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of these may relate to a specific
type of cancer, but all of these can
[SPEAKER_00]: mutate our DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mutants looking at viruses, viruses like
HPV is one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Age is standardized death rates on the
cervical cancer here by country per
[SPEAKER_00]: 100,000 inhabitants, and we could see
where there's very small amounts and where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's increased risk based on the
oranges to red region.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives us an idea where there's higher
occurrence of this particular virus,
[SPEAKER_00]: and where the risk might be higher for
those individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: UV light, ultraviolet light is the ionized
radiation, and double and single-stranded
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA breaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having this incoming UV photon,
and we're breaking apart portions of this
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how it's being mutated and
changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's different bindings that occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once this is occurring, it's just simply a
mutation that can lead into just continued
[SPEAKER_00]: cell growth, and could address the chance
for checks and balances for the cell to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bindings such as chemicals, DNA
intercalations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we're intercalating our DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where chemicals might be binding
towards DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: When DNA becomes bound to cancer-causing
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethidium bromide is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very well at binding with DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used in some labs here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gel has DNA in it that has ethidium
bromide because it glows under UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes it really easy when you're
running gels to be able to identify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, because it binds to DNA,
it's non-discriminatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to bind to the DNA in the gel,
or the DNA in your cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, scientists that work with
this, and I've worked with this before,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to be very careful about having a
barrier between you and ethidium bromide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice gloves here, stored in a very
protected and well-labeled container,
[SPEAKER_00]: stored in this particular location.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does serve a purpose when used
properly, but can be a mutant gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: and again, can cause cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What types of genes get mutated in cancer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oncogenes are activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal function, cells grow, and genes are
transcribed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a normal cell, this can be converted to
a cancer cell with the activation of these
[SPEAKER_00]: oncogenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is basically taking a normal cell and
transforming it, causing it to become a
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is typically evident by just
unrestricted growth that may occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased rates of replication,
and we see that loss of specialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tumor suppressor genes also could be
inactivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal function in DNA repair,
cell cycle growth is normal, leading to
[SPEAKER_00]: cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: While tumor suppressor genes, they go
through and they can inhibit proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: and cell division is under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a mutated portion here,
the tumor suppressor gene is no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: active.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just located here in the red region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cell division is now not under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening too quickly, and there's no
checks and balances.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the cells are taking on slightly
different shapes, and a lot more of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is as a result of tumor suppressor
genes being inactivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Characteristics in general of a cancer
cell, and this is again, speaking in the
[SPEAKER_00]: general overview kind of standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Self-sufficient growth signals,
activated growth factors in signaling,
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to anti-growth signals,
meaning it doesn't listen to shutdown
[SPEAKER_00]: signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: These inactivated checkpoints.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's constantly going through division
again and again and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: What ends up happening, I tried to show
them the picture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a cell that's just proliferating.
[SPEAKER_00]: One cell is just massively reproducing,
and ultimately get our mutagens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice that cancer cells here look
nothing like the original cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's a lot more of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we get to the idea and
concept of tumors.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a result of those cells that are
just growing out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Characteristics of a cancer cell could be
immortality, resistance to cell death,
[SPEAKER_00]: or having our telemeters at the very end
of our chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, a young cell has them capped off
just nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aging cells slowly lose them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're basically all gone,
the cell dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the cancer cell ends up doing is it
kind of puts a little cap on the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: By putting that cap on the end,
it constantly has these present.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cells are going to have that
immortal cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're constantly going to be able to go
to cell division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a flip back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This constant growth in cell division is
what's causing the issues here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these are some other
characteristics of cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's six total.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are three and four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, resistance to cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the cell doesn't die.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just keeps dividing, keeps dividing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's normally these checks and balances
to reduce that from occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other characteristics, we have
increased branching that occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: These signals that can cause this
branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the reason why this is characteristic
of a cancer cell is because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing out of control, they need a lot
more exchange of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, they're going to have the blood
vessels around them start to branch out so
[SPEAKER_00]: they can get more surface area to volume
ratio so they can exchange nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: waste a lot more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mistitis, another one, loss of cell to
cell interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having this abnormal just growth
that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, here's one that's got the mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the progression over time to an
invasive cancer cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tumor suppressor genes are guardians of
the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're involved in maintaining genome
integrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're responsible for DNA repair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mutants and tumor suppressor genes lead to
mutator phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mutation rates increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often the first mutation in a developing
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these genes that basically are
like brakes on a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to slow down cell growth and
prevent the car from hitting the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we modify these and take these safety
and checks and balances out, what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen is basically it's like a car
with no brakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to run to the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an example of running into
that cancer, getting that out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: P53 is a classic tumor suppressor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suppresses a genetic damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It halts the cell cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the DNA is irreparable, P53 will
initiate cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a process we call apoptosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's programmed cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the cell being able to go through
and realizing something's not right and
[SPEAKER_00]: basically killing itself off so it has
stability within the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apoptosis, again, it's programmed cell
death.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does occur normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a cell is no longer needed,
they commit suicide by activating this
[SPEAKER_00]: intercellular death program.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is different than cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a normal process.
[SPEAKER_00]: To go back, again, it's apoptosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the cell realizing something's not
right, killing itself off for the better
[SPEAKER_00]: of the tissue or the organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our toes and our fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no webbing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were cells when we were really small
that were in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the process of apoptosis,
we're able now to get individual fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see here this didn't occur quite
as it should have as did with the other
[SPEAKER_00]: toes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some animals, this is the male duck here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want webbing on their feet so they're
not going to have apoptosis of those
[SPEAKER_00]: particular cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wait for our hands to do because we
want to be able to grab things more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chromostone instability is another thing
that can cause issues and mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're noticing a nice separation of
these chromosomes will occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here our spindle fibers inaccurately grab
two of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to pull them in a weird format
to the top pole and none are going to come
[SPEAKER_00]: down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to cause an instability
within the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: What cancer therapies target?
[SPEAKER_00]: Classic cancer therapies target rapidly
dividing cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're targeting the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be using x-rays to kill target
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example here, a person would lay
down on the table here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to fire very precise x-rays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, these gamma rays are going to go
through and target that specific cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: cell and attack it from different angles
to help stop it from growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things that are targeting these
rapidly dividing cells is chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use of the drug throughout the entire
body, again, to really, this is an example
[SPEAKER_00]: of some of them, to really target and
pinpoint those rapidly dividing cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's many side effects with
chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you sadly know that it has gone through
this, everyone's experience is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some very common symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, hair loss, weakened immune system,
loss of appetite, diarrhea.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different grades of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see, again, the goal is to try to
reduce the amount of side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's going to depend on the
individual and the severity of their
[SPEAKER_00]: particular side effects that they're going
to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other therapies, person's immune system
will not be able to target tumor cells
[SPEAKER_00]: because the surface proteins appear to be
self.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get this cancer cell to begin
with and why isn't our body suppressing
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it appears to be self.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recognition markers do not throw up
any red flags so that our body or our
[SPEAKER_00]: normal immune system is not going to
target those cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these therapies, though,
are focusing on activating someone's
[SPEAKER_00]: immune system against a cancer cell
because if we can get our immune system to
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize these cells, something's not
going right here, they could potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: attack the cells and stop it from growing
into a large tumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Modern targeted therapies attack specific
proteins that are abnormally expressed in
[SPEAKER_00]: the tumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can block overly expressed growth
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, there are a few side effects
from this because it's so targeted.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, because it's so targeted,
it's very difficult to develop these
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advances are being made, which is great,
as we learn more about cell-to-cell
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition, but it takes a lot of
research because it's very specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: The polio virus in cancer, there's some
great research coming out with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the polio virus and it creates
very negative effects to the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crippling effects, potentially deadly
infections by a virus invade a person's
[SPEAKER_00]: brain, their spinal cord, causing
paralysis, causing basically death,
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of not a good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between two and 10 out of 100 people who
have paralysis from polio virus infection
[SPEAKER_00]: die because the virus affects the muscles
that help them stop the diaphragm.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very nasty virus, causes a lot
of death.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it is being used to try to treat
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've provided you three links here to a 60
minutes TV spot on how the polio virus is
[SPEAKER_00]: being used to fight cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bold treatment and it's granting
breakthrough status.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the goal is to try to take away some
of the virulence of the polio virus,
[SPEAKER_00]: inject it into the cancer cell as a way to
help the immune system recognize the
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be able to suppress tumors and
basically have one's own immune system
[SPEAKER_00]: take care and clean up the tumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some excellent videos here provide some
great ways to be able to see how something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's very deadly could potentially be
used to save someone's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I invite you to check those videos out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this is helpful to give you kind
of a brief overview of what cancer is,
[SPEAKER_00]: what some potential causes are for it.
Thank you.
See you next time.
