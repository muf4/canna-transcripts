[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in using a piston
pump to fertilize your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: this DeBaco University video is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into using a piston
pump fertilizer injector for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as we can see here in this commercial
operation, a lot of commercial operations
[SPEAKER_00]: use more than just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are Dosatrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people just refer to them as
Dosatrons, but it's kind of a name brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some other options like chemi
injector and many, many others,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Dosatron is kind of the name brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here each one hooked up to a
different fertilizer tank, allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: different valves to be controlled,
really allowing for efficient method of
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilization to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why this is so popular used in
cannabis production facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we're looking at here,
we're looking at the flow inside the pump
[SPEAKER_00]: and reciprocating pumps are pumps in which
a piston or diaphragm displaces a given
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of chemical with each stroke.
[SPEAKER_00]: The change in internal volume of the pump
creates high pressure, which forces
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals into the discharge pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're kind of seeing here is we
have our concentrated solution down here
[SPEAKER_00]: at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being brought up through a suction
force.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being mixed with the water through a
piston.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the blended solution is going out
to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These make a very distinctive clicking
sound as that pump comes up and down,
[SPEAKER_00]: up and down, up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will change with the rate of the
flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can increase the flow rate,
the piston will go up faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you decrease the rate of flow,
the piston will go up slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that is doing is that's allowing
for a very consistent amount of fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: to be added to this mixing area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important you have a pressure
regulator and also have a filter so you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not having any clogging issues,
as well as a check valve during any
[SPEAKER_00]: backflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are very precise methods of
injecting fertilizer to irrigation water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the basic operation of the piston
pump is similar to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cylinder in an automobile engine,
kind of the compression stroke,
[SPEAKER_00]: an increase and decrease to power stroke.
[SPEAKER_00]: The initial stroke, the chemical enters
the cylinder through the suction check
[SPEAKER_00]: valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a compression stroke, the chemical is
forced into the discharge line,
[SPEAKER_00]: located over here, through the discharge
check valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is water flow driven,
which is great because it offers
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent dilution rates and no needed
add for any electricity or any other
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply, the flow of water will allow this
pump to work just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it also offers self-correction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most piston pumps are driven by the
flowing water through the injector that
[SPEAKER_00]: drives the motion of the pump,
as I mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The movement of the piston will vary with
the speed of the water flow, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: great because it self-regulates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this self-corrects and ensures very
consistent dilution rates and very
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent rates given to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larger piston is driven by the
pressure of the irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller injects the chemical into the
irrigation line, and all of this simply
[SPEAKER_00]: works with water pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is one of the downfalls,
is there are some moving parts that can
[SPEAKER_00]: wear over time, particularly with
excessive use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's also an example here of a
grower setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows the fertilizer injector here,
along with a pre-filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have your kind of pre-filter
going through and ensuring that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: filtering out any contaminants so you're
not going to wear this out as quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a pressure valve located before
and after, again, help regulate and make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure there's no pressure loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilizer concentration tank located
right down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A water bypass, if you did not want to add
any fertilizer injector, had a problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to remove on the system,
a little bypass valve there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also hooked up to here, a timer and a
post-injection filter as well to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that may get pulled up in the
line before it enters your irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly important with drip
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this kind of shows you a setup and how
they can be used on a small homeowner
[SPEAKER_00]: operation as well as a large commercial
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it offers a lot of good consistency,
which is part of the reason why they're so popular.
