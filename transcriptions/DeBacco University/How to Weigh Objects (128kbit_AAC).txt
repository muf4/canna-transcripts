[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over how to
weigh objects, which might seem
[SPEAKER_00]: rudimentary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to focus on triple beam
balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to focus more on a digital
balance, which might seem easier,
[SPEAKER_00]: but does have its certain quirks and
proper procedures to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, key terms we're looking at here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gravity, force that pulls objects toward
the center of the Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mass is the amount of matter that an
object is made of.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does not change with gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And weight is the amount of gravity acting
on an object.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're talking about usually getting
the mass of something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, while it may seem easy, just put it on
a scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but it's a bit more complicated than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's essentially what you're
doing, but the details that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: pay attention for will ensure more
accurate results over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when I take care of the balance,
I want to make sure it's on a level
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, a lot of balances will have a kind of
a bubble built into them, so you're able
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell whether they're on a level
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important to ensure accuracy in
the sensor, especially for digital
[SPEAKER_00]: balances.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: This includes before, during, and after
its use, and calibrate the balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most balances that you'll use in class are
already calibrated, but they typically
[SPEAKER_00]: need to go through a calibration process,
at least initially, and then repeat it
[SPEAKER_00]: every so often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, again, helps ensure the accuracy
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Balance basics, electronic balances need
time to warm up before being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often, this is the case with digital
balances.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a very long time, but it can
feel very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, I do a countdown until they're
ready to be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times, there is that required
warm-up time, especially with the more
[SPEAKER_00]: higher-end balances.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can take five, sometimes 10,
15 minutes to warm up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to know how to zero the
balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, there will be an indicating for
that, but you always want to start with it
[SPEAKER_00]: reading all zeros.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to check that to be sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tearing the balance, it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the balance warms up, make sure it
reads zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not zero, then make sure to zero
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then place the wayboat on the balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the scale settles to zero,
before adding the chosen substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're going to do is read zero,
put your wayboat on there, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: little plastic dish, and then you're going
to tear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to cause it to read zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though there's something on the
balance, you're able to read zero so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can easily know exactly how much
whatever substance you're adding to that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the degree of detail that
you're looking for or the number of digits
[SPEAKER_00]: that your balance reads to, will depend on
how precise you have to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: With these more precise balances,
you can see they're typically enclosed in
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of plastic case to eliminate
other movements, like wind currents,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can cause it to be difficult to get a
consistent reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, balances generate a more accurate
weight for larger samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand limitations of the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A more precise balance is not necessarily
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three, just because you can read
a four decimal places doesn't mean it's
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily a better balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the detail that you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weighing something on the very end of any
balance is not going to give you the most
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times we're looking at scaling
that up or changing dilution rates or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that to be able to get the
most accurate and consistent reading
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
