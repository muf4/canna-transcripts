[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be going over carbon filters for
odor control in cannabis production
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at reducing odors of
your cannabis plants with carbon filters,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've come to the right place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, how do carbon filters work
in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever kind of inspected one,
it's kind of what you may see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon filters simply bind to odor
molecules and prevent them from remaining
[SPEAKER_00]: free-floating in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Activated carbon has a high amount of
surface area per volume, so it is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: contact while still maintaining a high
porosity, so you're not restricting your
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow all that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: A single gram of activated carbon features
a surface area of over 3,000 meters
[SPEAKER_00]: squared, so that's kind of an amazing
amount of surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that translates to is contact
points that you can have to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, fans and filters that we may have in
our grow facility, exhaust fans will pull
[SPEAKER_00]: or push air through the carbon filter
before exiting the grow space entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we typically see our fans
going to be moving air anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attaching a carbon filter can reduce odors
and ensure there's air being cleaned to
[SPEAKER_00]: the outside environment there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, keep in mind that humidity does
impact the effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And humidity levels above 70% is kind of
the limit of effectiveness of carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're getting 70 or 75 or above,
the effectiveness is going to be severely
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply because the water molecules in the
air essentially clog up the carbon pore
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, not allowing contact with the
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of that as really fine droplets of
water, limiting that high surface area of
[SPEAKER_00]: the carbon really to interact with the air
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, push or pull air through a carbon
filter, it's kind of like the option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I pull the air as we see over here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I pull the air kind of through that
carbon filter, or here am I pushing it
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of through?
[SPEAKER_00]: So some growers will pull air through the
carbon filter first and then to a fan
[SPEAKER_00]: before exiting out of the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other growers will have the air enter the
fan and then the filter before exiting to
[SPEAKER_00]: the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for maximum control, or odor control
at least, growers will utilize both
[SPEAKER_00]: systems where they'll pull air through,
take out the odors, and then they'll run
[SPEAKER_00]: it through another carbon filter to
absolutely ensure no odors are escaping
[SPEAKER_00]: their grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where would you place your carbon
filter?
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that it should be mounted
high up in the grow space so the hottest
[SPEAKER_00]: air will be removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will provide also a cooling effect
that helps with your ventilation system,
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of adding it as a component.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, if you're enriching the space
with carbon dioxide, this will remove the
[SPEAKER_00]: least amount of carbon dioxide since CO2
is heavier than air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mounting that carbon filter high
removes the hottest air with the least
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of CO2, still allowing ventilation,
but without allowing competing systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, for your carbon filters,
a lot of times they look like they're
[SPEAKER_00]: white cotton-based filters, but really
what that is is the pre-filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before air comes into contact with the
carbon, it should pass through a
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll simply filter out particulates,
not the odors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you have a pre-filter if you're
not really doing odor control?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is important because if the air
with high amounts of particulate come in
[SPEAKER_00]: contact with the carbon, despite its high
surface area, it will actually clog up the
[SPEAKER_00]: pores and reduce the effective life of the
carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind pre-filters are not very
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They extend the life of the carbon filter
and are easily washed and reused.
[SPEAKER_00]: All good positive aspects, which is the
reason why they should be added.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if those get dirty, you can simply
wash them out, clean them, throw them back
[SPEAKER_00]: on, and it really will help extend the
life of the more expensive carbon filter
[SPEAKER_00]: and extend the life of your ability to
reduce odors from your grow space.
