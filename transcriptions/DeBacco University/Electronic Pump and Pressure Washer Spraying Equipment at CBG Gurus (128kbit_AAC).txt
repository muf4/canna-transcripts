[SPEAKER_00]: Any growing operation is often a necessary
evil, as it's often said, is the spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this can be organic contact sprayers,
and the key part to make these as
[SPEAKER_00]: effective as possible is good coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this Tobacco University video,
we're going to go out to the CBG gurus to
[SPEAKER_00]: see how they use both an electronic pump
and experiment with a pressure washer to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to efficiently spray their plants
in a time-effective and good coverage
[SPEAKER_00]: method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that might be of interest to you
that you might be looking at trying out
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into the video of the
content, I want to just go over the
[SPEAKER_00]: mission of the CBG gurus because they are
built around the producing a premium
[SPEAKER_00]: quality craft hemp products that are
manufactured in stability and alignment
[SPEAKER_00]: with nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use wood chips to kind of suppress
their weeds and build soil quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as Korean natural farming methods
during the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I invite you to look at their website,
look at some of their contact information.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have interest, that's what we're
going to see a little bit of today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now two parts that we're going to look at
today are their use of both an electronic
[SPEAKER_00]: pump for spraying the hemp plants,
which is a more traditional style.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a portable nine-gallon sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an image of the one that you'll
see in the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's battery-operated, and the battery
does offer increased mobility in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the misting and total volume is
limited, reducing the total overall
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage, but it can be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they've also gone through some
experimentation, as we'll see,
[SPEAKER_00]: with use of a pressure washer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's an interesting concept because
you're able to use a large 50-gallon tank
[SPEAKER_00]: that's pumped out via a pressure washer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key component though to make this
method actually work is the handheld
[SPEAKER_00]: mister attachment to allow grower-directed
spray applications, and the three nozzle
[SPEAKER_00]: improves coverage and also reduces the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to provide the English conversion,
as well as the actual website here of the
[SPEAKER_00]: catalog located right down below here,
as well as in the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take a look at the attachment
yourself, but we can see both of these
[SPEAKER_00]: actually in action, how they're utilized
in the field, and just gives you a idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: what you might want to try to implement
with your growing operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here we can see the more
traditional use of spraying with the
[SPEAKER_00]: electric portable sprayer with a
battery-operated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it does have quite a bit of
force, but there is only one nozzle that
[SPEAKER_00]: it can support, and the length of the hose
goes down most of one row.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does make it easy to transport in the
field, which is something that you
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely want because you are spraying
on uneven terrain.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are other methods,
and this one uses a pressure washer,
[SPEAKER_00]: which of course has much more power.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here the pressure washer on
the left, but what makes this really work
[SPEAKER_00]: is the attachment on the nozzle on the
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we can see the handheld basically
on-off switch and the actual attachment
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly what it says,
but on the back label, there is a website
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see circled there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be in the bottom of the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the pressure washer has a lot of
power, as you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knock that little statue right over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much pressure when we first tested it
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It popped out the end misting nozzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, after some adjustments and
lowering the pressure on the pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: washer, we begin to get this dialed in,
and we can see here, a little bit later,
[SPEAKER_00]: now we definitely have more of a misting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have any overpressure with losing
that end nozzle there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a great misting that is occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that misting is really the key
part that we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage of the pressure washer is it
is hooked up to a 50-gallon container,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have a long hose attached here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe two hoses attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: That allows easy going up and down the
field and allows basically the stock
[SPEAKER_00]: 50-gallon tank to remain stationary,
giving the operator here only the
[SPEAKER_00]: basically the wand and the cord to worry
about, and we can clearly see in that
[SPEAKER_00]: setting sun there, the coverage that we're
able to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also able to get the very precise amount
of applied product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That allows us to spray the underside of
the leaves as well as the upper side,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's really a great thing to allow
coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're only holding the wand,
you basically can go under the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: really easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here that they're nicely
trained through the trellis netting
[SPEAKER_00]: mounted horizontally, and there's the kind
of the over spray as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now plants here are a little smaller,
so it's easy at the top, but you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: at those larger plants there on the right,
also able to get that very good even
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage, reducing the amount of product
applied and also applying it more
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something you might want to
take a look at, modifying a pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: washer to be able to allow you to more
easily spray your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep in mind, you might want to put
rollers at the end there to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope this was helpful.
Thanks for watching.
