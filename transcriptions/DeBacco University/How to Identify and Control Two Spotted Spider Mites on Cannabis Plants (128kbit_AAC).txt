[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video we're
going to attempt to give you some
[SPEAKER_00]: information regarding two-spotted spider
mites on cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright let's get into how to identify and
control two-spotted spider mites on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off the general description of
them and this is kind of gives you an idea
[SPEAKER_00]: what they look like when you zoom in.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit more of a zoomed out approach
just to show how small that they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a type of arachnid so the term
spider is rightfully so as they are
[SPEAKER_00]: related to insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very thin at about 1 1-fiftieth
of an inch long so they are small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow to orange in color with two dark
spots one on each side of their body which
[SPEAKER_00]: is evident clearly when you are able to
zoom in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a 30x kind of jeweler's loop is
recommended so you can be able to zoom in
[SPEAKER_00]: on the plants so you can be able to see or
identify them much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: When heavy infestations occur webbing on
the plants can also be present which a
[SPEAKER_00]: water mist may help visualize.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go through and kind of like take a
light mist and kind of mist the plants you
[SPEAKER_00]: might be able to see that fine droplets of
water attached to their webs which will
[SPEAKER_00]: make it easy to identify where they might
be located and where you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: spending time scouting and investigating
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that identification what is what are we
looking at here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that webbing occurs when high numbers
become established.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to first identify them when
the leaf flecking initially occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of what we're talking about
that kind of like initial looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: someone went through and just scraped off
tops of the leaves because they are kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of that feeding insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're going to notice
initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Positive ID may require that 30x loop as I
mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lens if you can get it with an LED
all the better because it really allows
[SPEAKER_00]: you to shine a bright light to a small
area to make identification of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: visually much much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also shake the leaves over a piece
of clean cardboard to help you detect
[SPEAKER_00]: their presence because they will be
knocked off and land on the cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned when they become well
established you get this definitely kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of marking of the leaf surface here that
leaf flecking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also have that web and of course this is
in advanced stage once when they're at
[SPEAKER_00]: much lower numbers this web will be much
thinner and that water mist will help you
[SPEAKER_00]: visualize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you go about managing
two-spotted spider mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well in general they are very difficult to
manage so this is want to be mindful of
[SPEAKER_00]: being very preventative and limiting their
numbers as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain species of lady beetles and
predatory mites naturally control
[SPEAKER_00]: two-spotted spider mites at least when
they're present in low numbers and that
[SPEAKER_00]: speaks again to the importance of keeping
spider mite numbers as low as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using long-lasting pesticides like
Biathrin or Prithrin kill natural enemies
[SPEAKER_00]: and should be avoided and encourage the
natural enemies to help regulate the
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using soaps or horticultural
oils that show some effectiveness to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure greater efficiency be sure apply
them to the underside of the leaves well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're getting a good coating of
that and also getting the top sides that's
[SPEAKER_00]: usually the easier portion of the plant to
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you may need to make repeated
applications of these products to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of effective control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep scouting for them be mindful of
any new plant material you bring in
[SPEAKER_00]: because you definitely want to avoid these
within your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
