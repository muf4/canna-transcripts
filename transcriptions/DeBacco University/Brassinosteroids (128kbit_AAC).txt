[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at the plant
hormone group Brassinosteroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one general category that there's
many that fall under this, so I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: speak in generalities here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brassinosteroids are groups of some 40
different steroids that are synthesized by
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and are important hormones
affecting many aspects of plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's 40 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just speaking to what this general
category does.
[SPEAKER_00]: These hormones act synergistically,
or at least additively, with several other
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones, such as oxygen and gibberellins,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what's unique about these
Brassinosteroids is that they're far more
[SPEAKER_00]: potent than other hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They act in far lower concentrations than
the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while all hormones act in very small
amounts, these can act in even smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts to get the same effect in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an example why I have the hot sauce
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm being very concentrated,
and a little amount of these can go a long
[SPEAKER_00]: way in having a plant effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do they do, though?
[SPEAKER_00]: They promote cell expansion and cell
elongation, and they work with oxygen to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to accomplish that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also promote vascular
differentiation, which is an example here,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we see xylem, and phloem is the
smaller areas here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these Brassinosteroids are involved
with that separation and specialization of
[SPEAKER_00]: our xylem, the larger ones here,
and the phloem, the smaller ones here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important for the vascular system
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also involved with pollen
elongation and for pollen tube formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very important in the plant is the
plant's ability to potentially have a
[SPEAKER_00]: successful pollination process.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, they have the ability to
improve the quantity and quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: horticultural crops and protect plants
against many environmental stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with advancements using these,
the hope is that these Brassinosteroids,
[SPEAKER_00]: these BRs, in the production of
horticultural crops become a more
[SPEAKER_00]: practical and hopeful strategy for
improving crop yields and success.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, under normal conditions,
if we have a stressor that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the plant performance, however
potentially with the use of this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular hormone, we could still have
those stressors and increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: performance of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why they've gained popularity due
to the ever increasing amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental stresses plants are under
and the ever demands by growers to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain consistent plant performance in
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these hormones could be one way to
help mitigate the negative impacts of
[SPEAKER_00]: stressors to plants.
Thank you.
