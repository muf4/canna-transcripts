[SPEAKER_00]: So based on the experiments Mendel
developed and did, he came up with some
[SPEAKER_00]: laws and some theories.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at some of those right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, studying just a simple garden pea
in his monastery in Austria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, he's the first one to come up
with the idea of heredity and considered
[SPEAKER_00]: the father of modern genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he worked with garden peas in his
monastery in Austria.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first things he came up with,
one of the first theories he came up with,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the fundamental theory of heredity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents do not transmit traits directly to
their offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do so via factors called genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we're tracking in our
planet squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, our genes are a segment of DNA
that encodes for a very specific amino
[SPEAKER_00]: acid sequence or a specific protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: How genes influence traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this should look familiar,
the central dogma here going from our DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: to our RNA to our proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amino acid sequence determines the
shape and activity of the proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proteins determine in large measure what
the body looks like and how it functions,
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially its color and basically its
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mutations in the gene result in alleles
and this ultimately leads to a change in
[SPEAKER_00]: the amino acid sequence and also the
activity of the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural selection may favor one allele
over another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to remember a mutation
does not necessarily automatically mean a
[SPEAKER_00]: bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mutation simply means that there's been a
change in the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's a good change or a bad change
will result from the environment or the
[SPEAKER_00]: natural selection that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's advantageous to have blue eyes
or brown eyes, that's going to be selected
[SPEAKER_00]: by the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other mutations will be, again,
determined whether or not they're
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial based on the environment that
they're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have webbing on your hands,
you're going through and doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: quick typing that may not be advantageous,
but if you're a duck swimming in the water
[SPEAKER_00]: and you lose the webbing, that would not
be a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it depends on the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other law, law of segregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: During reproduction, the alleles that
determine traits are separated into
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductive cells by a process called
meiosis and randomly unite during
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two alleles of a gene separate when
forming gametes and the gametes combine
[SPEAKER_00]: randomly to form an offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our segregation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, are randomly segregated, randomly
placed into different cells that will then
[SPEAKER_00]: merge together with an egg and a sperm or
egg and a pollen grain when you're forming
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual zygote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this segregation is just that
separating out or segregating where those
[SPEAKER_00]: alleles go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how it may look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is the male, this is the
female forming our seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our pollen grain here and our
egg merging together forms seed A,
[SPEAKER_00]: or in this case, seed B if you have
different segregation that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: How this may look and the color,
if it was as simple as being simply orange
[SPEAKER_00]: or green, if you took a pure orange and it
was capital O, capital O, and a pure
[SPEAKER_00]: green, two lowercase g's, you bred these
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, you'd have all orange offspring,
but all of these would be heterozygous
[SPEAKER_00]: because they would all have the green gene
also there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to breed these together,
you'd get a planet square that looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: this in 25% of the green.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other 75% that would be orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, phenotypically speaking,
genotypically speaking, only one would be
[SPEAKER_00]: double dominant orange.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other two would be heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the law of independent
assortment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, genes located on different
chromosomes will be inherited
[SPEAKER_00]: independently from one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means if you have a gene on
chromosome one, chromosome nine,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna be inherited independently
of one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is their independent assortment.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the genes located in chromosome one
will be moved over, chromosome nine will
[SPEAKER_00]: be moved separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is independent assortment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assorting things in basically an
independent, often random way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how it looks, independent
assortment and segregation as we're
[SPEAKER_00]: performing our dihybrid cross here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the symbol for female and male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see our segregation image,
independent assortment image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else that adds to genetic
variability is crossing over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at this during meiosis one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Homologous chromosomes basically come into
contact with one another and a little part
[SPEAKER_00]: of one can combine with another part of
another, meaning one can break off and
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an exchange in the positions of the
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic information is exchanged between
homologous chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, they're basically getting lined
up and you have one kind of flipping
[SPEAKER_00]: positions with the other and that's what
this shows right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two v-comic chromosomes are then
formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this adds to the genetic variability of
an offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, random fertilization occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A single egg fertilized by a single sperm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to remember you're a very
unique individual considering independent
[SPEAKER_00]: assortment and random fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: An offspring represents one out of 72
trillion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's trillion zygote possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about eight and a half million
different ways to make individual
[SPEAKER_00]: different sperm and 85 million different
ways to make an egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 8.5 million times the 8.5 million,
excuse me, 8.5 million times 8.5 million
[SPEAKER_00]: will give you 72 trillion zygote
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may ask initially the question,
what about identical twins?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, after fertilization, after the
zygote's made, if that zygote then is to
[SPEAKER_00]: divide after the fact, then you would have
two identical twins.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the odds, one in 72 trillion,
that a genetically identical sperm will
[SPEAKER_00]: meet a genetically identical egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a multiple traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna look at this when we do
dihybrid crosses here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, we're not just like a pea plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not inheriting white or purple
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might be inheriting things together and
that's the point of this dihybrid cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we'll go over.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, a little vocabulary here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each parent contains two copies of a
factor governing each trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the two copies are the same,
they're called homozygous, as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capital B, capital B.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is homozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: If two copies are different, they're
called heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it would be heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big B and a little B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little B and a big B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, two little b's is also homozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be homozygous recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be homozygous dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our alleles are forms or factors that lead
to different traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alternate forms are called alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, we can inherit one from parent
one and parent two.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, allele for both tall genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, from parent one, it's getting a
wrinkled pea pod.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, it's getting a smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, different alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending which one's dominant or
recessive, we'll determine which one is
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you an allele being transmitted
through an inbred pedigree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that family tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can trace things through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's important to be able to
understand these and recognize some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very basic one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenotype and genotype, you've already
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenotype is how an individual may look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genotype is the actual genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our genotypes represented here
by our capital and lowercase w's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our phenotypes, normal wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, wrinkled wings is our
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice the wrinkled wings is a homozygous
recessive genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dominant is for normal wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, those dominant recessive alleles,
the two alleles and the individual
[SPEAKER_00]: possesses do not affect one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, dominant versus recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dominant's going to be expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recessive will only be expressed in the
homozygous recessive state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dominant alleles are represented by
uppercase letters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recessive by lowercase letters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dominant alleles express the phenotype
when at least one of those alleles is
[SPEAKER_00]: present.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be the heterozygous or the
homozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recessive is only expressed as a
phenotype when both copies, both from both
[SPEAKER_00]: parents, are represented.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, two little r's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, the P would be wrinkled because
it's a recessive trait versus the round
[SPEAKER_00]: trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if this one is homozygous
dominant or heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do know there's at least one allele
though that is in the dominant or round
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our homologous chromosomes, they're the
same size, the same shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: They carry genes for the same traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not necessarily identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case here, there's a heterozygous
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different genes might be located.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be one from dad, one from mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're two N organisms deployed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we have a lot of homozygous
dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, they're not identical,
these chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One allele from mom, one allele from dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each trait is determined by adherence of
those two alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The alleles present in the chromosome are
distributed to gametes during meiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we have so many different
possibilities, because there's so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different genes that can be combination in
many different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in recessive inheritance,
again, there's something called carriers I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to draw your attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our punent squares here, a carrier
would be represented with a heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a carrier here, meaning the
recessive gene's not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's carried, it's present there,
and it may show up in the offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not show up in that particular
individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some traits occur in a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to think this is always
clear-cut and dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: With pea plants, though, it is pretty
clear-cut and dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eye color for one in particular is one
that varies a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of how can two people with
brown eyes have someone with blue eyes,
[SPEAKER_00]: gets into a little bit of the complexities
of genetics here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The odds are definitely for brown eyes,
but because it's dominant, there's many
[SPEAKER_00]: different traits that can occur,
many different genotypes that can
[SPEAKER_00]: represent that same phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those different genotypes can result in
different offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you have two people with blue
eyes, because that's a recessive trait,
[SPEAKER_00]: the eyes are very much in the favor of the
offspring to also have blue eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recessive traits, again, that carrier
aspect, the presence of an allele does not
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure the trait will be expressed in the
individual as an example of recessive
[SPEAKER_00]: trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have two carriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they can produce 25% of their
offspring with homozygous dominance,
[SPEAKER_00]: but 25% with homozygous recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other 50% will be carriers of that
particular trait, not expressing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: carrying that recessive allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, recessive does not necessarily mean
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Autosomal dominant is one possible way for
a trait or a disorder, in some cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be inherited.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we see here, in autosomal dominant
disease, if the abnormal genes inherited
[SPEAKER_00]: only from one parent, disease will be
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, if it's a dominant disorder,
or disease, it's going to be expressed
[SPEAKER_00]: even if only one allele is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recessive, though, means an organism
needs two copies of that gene in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: express that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If only one copy is present, expression
will not occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: That person will be considered a carrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That person, being a carrier, will not be
infected themselves, but can still pass
[SPEAKER_00]: that on to their offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: If an offspring of an autosomal recessive
combination of alleles, typically,
[SPEAKER_00]: the parents are carriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the offspring represents it,
but the parents do not, the parents are
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to be carriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this is helpful in explaining a
little bit about heredity, and to
[SPEAKER_00]: tonight's.
Thank you.
