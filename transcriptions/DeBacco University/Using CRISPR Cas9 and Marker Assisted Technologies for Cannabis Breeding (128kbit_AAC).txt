[SPEAKER_00]: All right, welcome to this Tobacco
University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be talking about using
CRISPR Cas9 and marker-assisted
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies for cannabis breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a very precise way,
a methodology that's being refined to
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically target certain sequences
within a DNA to splice genes out or add
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that growers may be deeming
desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what is this CRISPR Cas9?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, CRISPR is short for Clustered
Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeats.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a system that evolved as an
adaptive immune response in bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: in archaea, to defend against invading
viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that occurs in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows the bacteria to essentially keep
a genetic record of invading viral DNA to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow for a speed-up in response time to
render a virus inactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually an evolutionary genetic
kind of improvement for bacteria to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to recognize foreign viral DNA and
counteract it at a quicker rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This technology, though, can be applied to
plants breeding by allowing for a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: gene loci to be targeted for gene
alteration, responsible for specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: turning a sequence and adding in genes we
may, again, deem desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the use for CRISPR?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at CRISPR, breeding
processes that are assisted with CRISPR
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies may benefit from the
reduction in time to develop a new
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really great targeted method for
being able to go through the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: gene editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, this can allow for a
quicker development of a cultivar instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of through traditional breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are marker-assisted technologies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a kind of a couple here that
I'll be covering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have isozyme variation, RFLP,
PCR, and microsatellites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be at least providing you with a
little bit of background as a brief
[SPEAKER_00]: overview of each of these within this
video lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with kind of where do we
get this information from?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always good to cite your sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see here a reference article that
you're welcome to go through and provide
[SPEAKER_00]: you with the reference link to copy the
first page and a direct link.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to go and take a look at
this if you want to learn even more
[SPEAKER_00]: information than is presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the first one that I
mentioned, isozyme variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe something you're probably not
familiar with per se, maybe something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not very common and understandably
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But isozymes are basically protein
markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This technique is based on the principle
that allelic variations exist for many
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: This uses a simple process of making a
crude protein extract from some tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: sources, usually leaves that are separated
by gel electrophoresis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage though is a number of
isozyme loci that can be scored is
[SPEAKER_00]: limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a limiting form of
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different sorts of tissues will
provide different results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may not necessarily be repeatable
amongst the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, this is rarely used today in
favor of what I'm going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: next, RFLPs, which you may still see some
instances, particularly old studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: where this was utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those RFLPs, what does that stand for?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's looking at what's called
restriction fragment length polymorphism.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a molecular marker based on
differences in the genomic DNA level.
[SPEAKER_00]: These RFLP markers are defined by a
specific enzyme probe combination that
[SPEAKER_00]: identifies one single locus at a time and
utilizes agarose gel separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage of even RFLPs is that
genomic clones that are represented
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences at random are poor choices as
hybridization probes because plant genomes
[SPEAKER_00]: consist of a large percent of repeated
sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those repeated sequences can cause
issues in the sense that there's not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily 100% all unique DNA amongst
the whole length.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has not been widely used for hemp
compared to other crop species simply
[SPEAKER_00]: because of this evidence that there is a
lot of repeat in units.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes this technique a little less
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to PCR, which again stands for
polymer chain reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something we might hear about more,
more common technique been around for
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the restriction digest of
genomic DNAs followed by PCR amplification
[SPEAKER_00]: of the fragments obtained.
[SPEAKER_00]: This uses labeled primers that anneal to
the ends of the fragments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anneal simply means to attach to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a variable number of extra
nucleotides randomly chosen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to amplify only a subset of the total
fragments is obtained.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really looking at that targeted kind
of genetic sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The labeled amplification products are run
through a polyacrylamide gel and then are
[SPEAKER_00]: separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of go through and you have
this long piece of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for a certain gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have these certain primers that are
targeting a specific sequence of that
[SPEAKER_00]: whole gene, as we can see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go through this cycle many,
many times, generate many copies if that
[SPEAKER_00]: targeted sequence is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we run it through a gel to
separate out, again, visually confirm its
[SPEAKER_00]: presence or where it may be within that
DNA sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning if there was a lot of products,
you're going to see a very darkened bar
[SPEAKER_00]: there indicating a lot of DNA at that
particular base pair length.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then lastly here, we have something called
microsatellites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's a microsatellite referring to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these are short sequences of two,
three or more nucleotides that are
[SPEAKER_00]: represented from a variable number of
times in a genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, one single locus is identified
by each PCR reaction, but the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: alleles that can be identified is very
high as the variability in the repeated
[SPEAKER_00]: motif number is high in the plant genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only recently identified and used for
cannabis is kind of like the new and
[SPEAKER_00]: emerging technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microsatellite markers were the most
useful in describing the hemp germoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result from this study showing or
indicating that these microsatellites show
[SPEAKER_00]: greater promise, this is what's being
considered to maybe be utilized more going
[SPEAKER_00]: forward, at least for cannabis,
simply because of the many repeated units
[SPEAKER_00]: that tend to exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So PCR is still involved, but not just
using PCR, utilizing these kind of short
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences, these microsatellites,
for example here, to look for these
[SPEAKER_00]: repeats there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows a lot of promise looking at hemp
and can be a great way to potentially look
[SPEAKER_00]: at breeding cannabis and knowing and
understanding of cannabis with greater
[SPEAKER_00]: detail going forward.
