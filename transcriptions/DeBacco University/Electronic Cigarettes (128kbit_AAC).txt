[SPEAKER_00]: So while the use of electronic cigarettes
has been on the rise, I found some
[SPEAKER_00]: alarming facts that I want to share with
you regarding their usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more than 2 million middle and high
school students were current users of
[SPEAKER_00]: electronic cigarettes, which is kind of an
alarming fact when clearly they're not for
[SPEAKER_00]: sale to minors.
[SPEAKER_00]: 11% of high school and 4.3% of middle
school students were current users of
[SPEAKER_00]: e-cigarettes in 2006 based on information
that I found.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've included links at the bottom here,
so remember in the description you can go
[SPEAKER_00]: to the slides, pause it, and direct copy
the URL into your chosen web browser.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting though is according to
the 2013 to 2014 survey, 81% of current
[SPEAKER_00]: e-cigarette users cited the availability
of appealing flavors as the primary reason
[SPEAKER_00]: for their use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a little bit of a concern when
we're looking at how these are being
[SPEAKER_00]: marketed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who they're being potentially marketed
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get to like the US Surgeon
General and the American Lung Association
[SPEAKER_00]: and their feelings on these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the US Surgeon General concluded
that e-cigarettes can expose users to
[SPEAKER_00]: several potentially harmful chemicals,
more than just the nicotine we might
[SPEAKER_00]: associate with the term cigarette.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carboxymal groups, volatile organic
compounds, or just some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: harmful chemicals that you might be
exposed to if you're choosing to use
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: The American Lung Association as a result
supports basically prohibiting the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: e-cigarettes in work sites and public
places, including e-cigarettes under
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke-free laws with other tobacco
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for this is they remain
concerned about their impact on public
[SPEAKER_00]: health given the dramatic increase in use,
especially among youth.
[SPEAKER_00]: E-cigarettes are a tobacco product in the
youth are using e-cigarettes at an
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing and actually alarming rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The information I found again,
URL found at the bottom here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The US Surgeon General found e-cigarettes
among high school students increased by
[SPEAKER_00]: 900% from just 2011 to 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the most current data that I can
find.
[SPEAKER_00]: With more teens now using e-cigarettes
than cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that reason is potentially being
glamorized more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, marketing of these e-cigarettes
could be more directed to youth because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're offering like candy flavors like
bubble gum and gummy bears, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: typically appealing to a younger audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just something we're noticing a
dramatic increase of.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there is definitely some
associated risk with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are considering this as a
cleaner or better alternative to
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional cigarettes, you may want to
think twice, even though it is being
[SPEAKER_00]: increased in the amount of use that we're
seeing across the nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scary part is it's being used at a
much higher rate amongst youth,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as middle, sadly, and even high
school students.
Thank you.
