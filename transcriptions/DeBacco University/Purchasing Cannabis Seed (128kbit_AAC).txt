[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever wondered what to look for
when going about purchasing cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here at Tobacco University,
we're going to provide you with some
[SPEAKER_00]: information that will get you beyond just
looking at potentially a flashy package
[SPEAKER_00]: and to try to look for being an informed
consumer when you go about purchasing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the video here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, what do you look for when
purchasing seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, ideally you want something that's
got more than just a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to find seeds or seeds that
provide you at least with a germination
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage, emergence percentage ideally,
paperwork, COA, certificate of
[SPEAKER_00]: authenticity, and you may also,
if you have the option, want to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: visual inspection, we'll go over what you
should be looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that germination is the
development of a plant from a seed or
[SPEAKER_00]: spore after a period of dormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The production of an initial root or
radical is the marking of germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these images, all three of these
seeds have germinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers think it's an
interchangeable term between germination
[SPEAKER_00]: and our next term emergence, and it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The germination only refers to the seed's
ability to produce a root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time, this is what seed
manufacturers will, percentage-wise,
[SPEAKER_00]: will produce our print on their label.
[SPEAKER_00]: What growers want really is emergence,
because that's taking germination kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: to the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emergence is an outgrowth from a stem or
leaf composed of epidermal and
[SPEAKER_00]: subepidermal tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The act of the seed breaking through the
soil and unfurling its leaves is
[SPEAKER_00]: emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these have emerged, and that's
really what growers think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, germination is just a production
of the root, and not every seed that
[SPEAKER_00]: produces a root will be able to emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, a high percentage
emergence is what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And emergence will always be a smaller
percentage than germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that COA mentioned that certificate of
analysis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to hemp cultivation,
licensing of valid COA is critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important to have this in hand
and be able to get this from wherever
[SPEAKER_00]: you're purchasing your seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: COA is an official document outlining the
test results of a given product in common
[SPEAKER_00]: for food, chemicals, and pharmaceutical
products as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A COA can be performed either in-house or
by a third party as long as the entity is
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically a third party would be
advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through specific hemp seed requirements
vary by location.
[SPEAKER_00]: A valid COA will meet most of the
conditions, but be always wise to check
[SPEAKER_00]: your local area rules and requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reputable hemp seed banks will always have
a product COA ready to view even
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially before you purchase the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you go through purchasing it,
if you can't find it, it is definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: something as a grower you should be
requesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this COA tell you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, why is it, quote, so important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, COA will list all of the most common
cannabinoids found in the sample,
[SPEAKER_00]: including Delta-9-THC, Delta-8-THC,
THC-V, THC-A, CBD-A, CBD-V, CBN,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBNA, and CBC, just to name a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that Delta-9-THC is the
distinguishing factor between hemp and
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be very important to at least
have documentation of what that level is
[SPEAKER_00]: expected to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: To determine if a sample meets the
criteria for hemp or marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Delta-9-THC concentration is key and
is important to make sure that you are
[SPEAKER_00]: planting something that will keep you
within the requirements that your law
[SPEAKER_00]: requires.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example to COA here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is only just an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might look slightly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But additionally, a certificate of
analysis will list product contaminants as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this includes microorganisms,
residual solvents and chemicals and heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals, which hemp is notorious for
collecting from the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, each of these items should come
with a CLEAR or ND, which stands for
[SPEAKER_00]: basically not detectable stamp of
approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can go for both seeds as well as
purchasing any sort of plant material as
[SPEAKER_00]: well or dried flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, this does expand beyond
just seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something you should be requesting
for any sort of plant product that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I mentioned that visual
inspection, what should you be looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're getting a bunch of seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this may typically happen after you
purchase seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can provide a general idea of the seed
grade that you actually have received.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do good seeds look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in our kind of example pile of seeds
here, most of these we classify as good
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, at least from a visual inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark in coloration, some of these kind of
darker spots on them are all good signs of
[SPEAKER_00]: fully developed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds that are light in coloration or have
a lot of green to them in their coloration
[SPEAKER_00]: typically are poor grade seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, are going to have a
reduction in the percent germination from
[SPEAKER_00]: these more fully developed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, growers always ask, well,
is a bigger seed a better quality seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at the size of the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that cannabis seeds of fiber
cultivars tend to be larger than those of
[SPEAKER_00]: the drug strains, just in general
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: This we do in part to fiber based plants
having greater history of being used for a
[SPEAKER_00]: food source rather than the drug based
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in actuality, the size of the seed
really is not necessarily a mark of the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality, more of the kind of visual
inspection and that dark coloration with
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those tiger stripes and those dark
spots and lines is a better indication of
[SPEAKER_00]: higher quality versus one that might be
kind of a white off color, might be light
[SPEAKER_00]: or kind of have a lot of green to it,
maybe a sign of an underdeveloped poor
[SPEAKER_00]: quality seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind when you're
going through and planting, give your
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds a good visual inspection and make
note of that based on whoever you choose
[SPEAKER_00]: to purchase your seeds from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
