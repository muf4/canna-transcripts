[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to learn about the
pancreas, which while it is an accessory
[SPEAKER_00]: organ to the digestive system,
it is absolutely necessary for the full
[SPEAKER_00]: process of digestion to occur and
ultimately the survival of the human
[SPEAKER_00]: being.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the pancreas, where is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it lies posterior to the stomach
from the duodenum towards the spleen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's important it's located here
because you'll notice the digestive
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes are directly entering the
duodenum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important because remember the
duodenum is directly connected or
[SPEAKER_00]: receiving items leaving the stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is very important it's located
here so it's releasing those enzymes into
[SPEAKER_00]: the early part of the small intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it produces several enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lipase is one that adjusts fat in the
lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amylase, which digests, starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trypsin or chymotrypsin, which is
important for the digestion of proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see just right there the
pancreas secreting enzymes to break down
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins, starch, which is your
carbohydrates, and also your fats.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order for these enzymes to function
properly, since we are just coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the stomach, they don't perform well at a
very low pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pancreas as a result will secrete
bicarbonate, which neutralizes HCl,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is hydrochloric acid in the chyme,
as it directly leaves the stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to raise that pH so these enzymes
can work at a more optimum rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, the pancreas is also
important for its release of insulin and
[SPEAKER_00]: glucagon, which regulates sugar levels in
the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the pancreas, more than 90% of cells
have a function for the digestive system.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the pancreas is also,
as I said, is important for maintaining
[SPEAKER_00]: the body's blood glucose or sugar levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Primary hormone of the pancreas includes
insulin and glucagon to both regulate the
[SPEAKER_00]: blood glucose levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diabetes is the most common disorder
associated with the pancreas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at our images here,
we see our normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see our insulin going through,
binding, causing glucose to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember insulin, glucose into the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a dysfunction, which is
diabetes type 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: The destruction of the V cells where
insulin is simply not produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: By insulin not being produced,
there's nothing to receive the signal,
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing to bring glucose into the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: In concrete contrast to this, we have type
2 diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we notice the enemy cells the
same, glucose is not being uptake by the
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, we have insulin being
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there is insulin resistance on
the receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, here the receptor cannot
bind the insulin, glucose cannot enter the
[SPEAKER_00]: cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, insulin is not being
produced, so this fully functional
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor has nothing to bind to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, it doesn't allow glucose in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shows the normal condition,
where we have our insulin being produced,
[SPEAKER_00]: bind our receptor, allowing glucose to
come into the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, kind of taking a look at this in the
direct relation to the pancreas,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have our increase and decrease in
glucose levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insulin is being released when it comes
too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glucagon, when it gets too low,
bringing it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see it's trying to maintain in
this tight range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to keep a constant level in the
body through this what we call a negative
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it comes up too high, releases it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're trying to put it into the
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to reduce blood glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it gets too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glucagon, we're going to take it out of
the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll bring it back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this kind of up and down
negative feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: The system model line represents the blood
glucose level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to keep this in a tight
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it is increasing and decreasing,
as the graph shows, this is kept in a very
[SPEAKER_00]: close range.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not massive swings up or down,
up or down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very tight range.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to average out on this line
here, going right down the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to keep this in a tight
range.
We're trying to keep this in a tight
range.
So while it is increasing and decreasing,
as the graph shows, this is keeping in a
tight range.
