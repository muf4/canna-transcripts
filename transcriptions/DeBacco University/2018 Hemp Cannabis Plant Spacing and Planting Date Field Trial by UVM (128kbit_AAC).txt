[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to outdoor growing,
oftentimes questions get asked about how
[SPEAKER_00]: far should I space my plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's my ideal planting date?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here is going to be a trial looking
at hemp cannabis to answer some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be presented here on Tobacco
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at the 2018 Hemp Cannabis
Plant Spacing and Planting Date Field
[SPEAKER_00]: Trial by UVM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're looking to get some more
information of where this information was
[SPEAKER_00]: pulled from, here's a link to the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this study by UVM answers a lot of
questions growers may have, at least
[SPEAKER_00]: provides you with some research data
comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, UVM is the University of Vermont
extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the original source of this
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, well, where are we talking
geographically to this research?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was this research conducted?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see here way up in kind of
northern Vermont here, almost we're kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of New York, Vermont in Canada,
all kind of come at a little intersection
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, probably a little bit far
north compared to some other growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just gives you an idea, again,
where this occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the different plant spacings,
there was a one foot by one foot,
[SPEAKER_00]: three foot by three foot, five foot by
five foot were the plant spacings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we can see the different
populations of plants per acre with each
[SPEAKER_00]: of those different spacings.
[SPEAKER_00]: With outdoor research, good to have an
idea of the location, the previous crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: the planting date, fertilization,
harvest date, and hear that information is
[SPEAKER_00]: provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also with outdoor locations, one of the
great variable factors is the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, while it may be a little
different for your regions, it's important
[SPEAKER_00]: to know that for outdoor locations,
the weather is important to know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it can vary from year to year and
vastly impact the data collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, while you may not be growing in
this exact location, you can get an idea
[SPEAKER_00]: what their departure from normal was for
average temperature, precipitation,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as growing degree days of the
months of June, July, August, September,
[SPEAKER_00]: and October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're looking at our plant spacing on
plant weight and also plant height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the plants in the five foot by five
foot spacing had significantly greater
[SPEAKER_00]: plant weight compared to other spacings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average weight was 9.11 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that right here, vastly
different than the two other spacings that
[SPEAKER_00]: were also studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant heights, relatively similar
across all plant spacings, looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: height, again, measured here in
centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, plant spacing impact on flower yield,
because that's what we're kind of looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at, is kind of the yield and particularly
the flower yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the five foot by five foot spacing
resulted in the greatest amount of dry
[SPEAKER_00]: matter, flower yield, in pounds per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be correlated with the highest
pounds per plant weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the one foot by one foot spacing
resulted in the greatest amount of dry
[SPEAKER_00]: flower yield in pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, important to make this
distinction between pounds per plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to be growing on a very
large scale and you're concerned about
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling the most pounds per acre,
that can slide you to one spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're limited on the number of plants,
you want to have the highest pound per
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, well, that might shift to a
different spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're curious with some more of the
detail the data looked like, the data
[SPEAKER_00]: table is provided down here on this slide,
and you're welcome to pause the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the planting date impact on plant
weight and height.
[SPEAKER_00]: As might be expected, the plant weight in
pounds per plant decreased as the planting
[SPEAKER_00]: dates became later in the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can clearly see that with the
planting date of June 14th, June 21st,
[SPEAKER_00]: and June 27th, and the plant weight in
pounds overall decreasing from there with
[SPEAKER_00]: each proceeding later planting date from
the one studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now planting dates impact on flower yield,
because again, it always comes back to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of that yield in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was surprising when averaged across all
plant spacings, there was no significant
[SPEAKER_00]: differences observed between planting
dates for flower yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there were differences noted when
plant spacing and planting date
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions were investigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just an important kind of note
there that where were there differences
[SPEAKER_00]: and where were there not differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, see the data here, really at the
LSD level of 0.1, no significant
[SPEAKER_00]: difference shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at our planting spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant spacing, impact, and yield,
and also plant weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the June 14th, 2018 planting the
five by five foot spacing plants showed
[SPEAKER_00]: the best yields and highest amounts of
unmarketable buds on a per plant basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the June 21st planting, the one foot
by one foot spacing had the best yield and
[SPEAKER_00]: least amount of unmarketable buds per acre
basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have the five by five foot
spacing, again for the 27th planting,
[SPEAKER_00]: having the best yield and greatest amount
of unmarketable buds per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, looking at the data here,
we can see the different spacings,
[SPEAKER_00]: different planting dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the 14th, the 21st, and the 27th.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried to provide you a little bit of
a summary here, focusing on see the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: weight, dry matter of flower, unmarketable
dry flower, dry matter of flower yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: and unmarketable dry flower yield as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to take into
consideration that unmarketable dry flower
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as far as what might be considered
to be a loss or need to go really to
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction or be a lesser quality overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conclusions is that surprisingly
the five foot by five foot treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: generally had the greatest amount of
unmarketable buds per acre on a per plant
[SPEAKER_00]: basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this could be explained because
the flower buds were deemed unmarketable
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily due to soil contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means simply because the plants were
so big, there could be some drooping
[SPEAKER_00]: effects to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to know that yes,
it produced those unmarketable buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this was a reason why they were
considered to be unmarketable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as always, weather as an impact and
climate variability may affect to the
[SPEAKER_00]: yield benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, comparing the 27th of June
planting, compared to that 27th of June
[SPEAKER_00]: planting, the June 17 planting yielded 165
pounds of dry matter bud per acre more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the June 21st planting yielded about
488 pounds of dry matter per bud per acre
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it was planted seven days
after the June 14th planting, it yielded
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be because June was a
relatively cold month for this 2018 year
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to historical averages,
which may have stunted the June 14th
[SPEAKER_00]: planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this just kind of shows you the
variability and sometimes the luck of the
[SPEAKER_00]: draw when you're looking at outdoor
planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, just my end kind of grower
suggestions of we looked at all this
[SPEAKER_00]: information, you know, what can I kind of
like pull from this information?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I use for this information?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in regards to plant spacing,
if your area is limited size, greater
[SPEAKER_00]: plant spacing of five foot by five foot is
advised to grow larger plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers are suggested to apply more
individual care to each plant to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the unmarketable dry flower yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you're in a growing situation
that your area is not space limited,
[SPEAKER_00]: then a drastic reduced plant spacing to
all the way down to one foot by one foot
[SPEAKER_00]: will increase the dry matter flower yield
in pounds per acre with reduced need for
[SPEAKER_00]: individual plant care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if everyone wants to know what
the ideal plant spacing is, we can come
[SPEAKER_00]: down to what the growers conditions are.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as planting date goes, assuming
favorable weather, mid-June should be the
[SPEAKER_00]: target planting date to allow for timing
with the longest photo periods of the year
[SPEAKER_00]: to hopefully retail in the best yields at
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these are just some grower
suggestions here, but kind of that
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting note, if you're looking at the
pounds per acre or pounds per plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: how that will affect your spacing and that
really comes down to your method or style
[SPEAKER_00]: of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this was helpful to digest
some of this complex data to give you some
[SPEAKER_00]: actual suggestions that you can apply to
your field growing situation.
