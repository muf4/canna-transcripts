[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure if you've seen this insect in
your cannabis plants, but corn earworms
[SPEAKER_00]: can be a major pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this DeBacco University video,
I'm going to go over how to properly
[SPEAKER_00]: identify and control them in your cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over how to identify
and control corn earworms in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of what they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you haven't seen them,
but if you have, this video should provide
[SPEAKER_00]: you with some helpful information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the description of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, corn earworms is one of the most
widespread commonly damaging insects in
[SPEAKER_00]: much of the United States, affecting both
field crops as well as vegetable crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: all in addition to hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most damage is done by the late stage
caterpillars, which are present 10 to 14
[SPEAKER_00]: days after egg hatching and feed for a
week or two before being fully grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of at this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often there will be a granular form fecal
kind of like pellets or frass left around
[SPEAKER_00]: the feeding site that can be used for
diagnosing an injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also what the adult corn earworm
may look like there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of what the larval stage
looks, and that's what the egg looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the proper identification of that,
at least looking at on cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: the adult moss fly at dusk and evening,
although a few are sometimes active on
[SPEAKER_00]: overcast days.
[SPEAKER_00]: On other plants, the moss lay most of
their eggs on the leaves or in corn,
[SPEAKER_00]: the green kind of silk area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get to name earworm.
[SPEAKER_00]: On hemp though, eggs are likely laid on
the outer areas of the plant, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: on the younger leaves, such as those
surrounding the flower buds and developing
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we see the kind of
caterpillar up here feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we also see the damage to the bud
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as far as what can we do regarding
this particular pest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for the management of corn earworms,
Entrust was the only product that provided
[SPEAKER_00]: really effective control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, this is the one product
that was evaluated by, this is Vermont,
[SPEAKER_00]: and is not allowed to be applied on hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the one that they really looked
at, does show some effectiveness,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we can see clearly here, but not
certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that was the time this
publication, maybe things have changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check your local restrictions and current
restrictions at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The insecticide Entrust is army certified,
however, so that's a plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we can see the mean corn earworms
per 10 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Entrust definitely doing a great job at
reducing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corn earworm damage rating also was
reduced by Entrust, so that is definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: something to look at to see if it's
available to use in your particular area
[SPEAKER_00]: or regulations, because it might be a
first step at an effective control for
[SPEAKER_00]: corn earworms on your cannabis plants.
