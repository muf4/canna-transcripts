[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to DeBaco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be looking at some
hair basics and getting some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: details for what we can actually determine
when looking at a piece of hair and what
[SPEAKER_00]: components hair is made of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first off, the hair and fiber
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in this case, it cannot be used to
match a suspect with a crime scene,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be microscopically analyzed for
similarities, and comparisons can be
[SPEAKER_00]: provided to improve as forensics
techniques improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, hair and fiber both fall
into the category of being class evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, hair and fibers for identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hair offers some benefits to
forensic scientists because the hair
[SPEAKER_00]: resists decomposition, so it's more likely
to be found at a crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hair may also indicate drug use or
poisoning, and we can see that analyzing
[SPEAKER_00]: the hair, different regions of that hair,
we could find potential for drug usage in
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain period of time and potentially
link that, or at least conclude that as
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the story for the crime scene
investigation report.
[SPEAKER_00]: The anatomy of hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you're welcome to pause the video at
this point and look at things in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be focused on the medulla,
the cortex, in the outer portion,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cuticle region.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, realize that hair is embedded in
the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the way down to the dermal layer
where the blood vessels are found,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're going to be looking specifically
at that hair fiber and some of the areas
[SPEAKER_00]: within that hair fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first off, we got to look at the
general structure of the hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, on the outermost portion, we have the
cuticle, and this has overlapping scales,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can notice that here in the green
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the cortex, which is a
protein-rich structure around the medulla
[SPEAKER_00]: that contains the pigment, and in that
center region there, we have the medulla,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the central core.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some instances, that may be absent,
so it's important for identification
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we have the pencil here is we
can think of this hair structure as a
[SPEAKER_00]: pencil, where the medulla being the
graphite, or that center region,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cortex being the wood represented by
the pencil, the cuticle being the paint on
[SPEAKER_00]: the outside, just to get you to understand
how these layers interact and where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're located.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that hair structure, again,
what we're focusing on is kind of these
[SPEAKER_00]: different layers, and we can see that
while the hair looks very thick in this
[SPEAKER_00]: instance, it's actually made of many,
many small fibers, which is part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why it's so strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's strong for its small diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just so you're aware of where it's
located within the body, within the
[SPEAKER_00]: integumentary system, I could see here
where it's located with some glands,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the hair matrix is located,
and the hair bulb down here at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking mainly here at the hair
shaft and portions of the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this hair follicle, look at the
follicle as part of the skin, which grows
[SPEAKER_00]: a hair by packing old cells together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's attached on the inside and top of the
follicle, our sebaceous glands,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are tiny sebum-producing glands in
almost all skin, except the palms,
[SPEAKER_00]: lips, and soles of the feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here we're looking at the sebum being
produced, and that's kind of what gives
[SPEAKER_00]: the hair some of its protective oils as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root of the hair, the hair shaft,
is part of the hair not anchored to the
[SPEAKER_00]: follicle, and much of this is exposed at
the skin's surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rest of the hair, which is
anchored in the follicle, lies below the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface of the skin, is referred to as the
hair root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when we're investigating a potential
hair that may have been forcefully
[SPEAKER_00]: removed, we might want to identify or
properly identify an area of the hair
[SPEAKER_00]: shaft compared to the hair root region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's that sebaceous gland tied
right in, providing the oils, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: for that hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at a cross-section of the hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, think of that same pencil
concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is showing the different layers of
the hair shaft, that medulla being in the
[SPEAKER_00]: center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the cortex here that may
contain pigment granules, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: outermost region being the cuticle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cuticle being the outermost region,
remember, that is the covering of the
[SPEAKER_00]: hair, and we can see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's formed by flat, overlapping,
and hardened scales, and the degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: those scales, again, help us identify
whether it's human hair or potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: some animal hairs, as we'll see in another
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that hair cuticle is that outermost
covering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is an example of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember back from that first one I
showed you, it was the green outer area,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's important to hear the
distinguishing between hairs of different
[SPEAKER_00]: species, but are often not useful in
distinguishing between different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be important to know,
oh, we found some hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, is it the neighborhood cat,
or is it someone that might be a human?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, the cuticle can be used for
identification purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When comparing the scales, you want to
look at how many there are per centimeter,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many have they overlapped,
what's their shape, how much they protrude
[SPEAKER_00]: from the surface, what's their thickness,
and is there pigment present?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are all questions you want to ask
when analyzing the cuticle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cuticle classifications, so they all
kind of look the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, if you look very
carefully, particularly with a microscope,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are different categories that they
will fall into, and this, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: can help us identify what potential
species that hair might be from and can be
[SPEAKER_00]: used to eliminate or, again, looking at
class evidence here, eliminate certain
[SPEAKER_00]: hairs that might be found that aren't of
human species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cortex, so now we're kind of looking
at that next layer down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the thickest hair layer located in
the interior portion of the hair between
[SPEAKER_00]: the cuticle and the medulla.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains the hair pigments or melanin,
and pigments are absent, though,
[SPEAKER_00]: in gray hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as someone ages and gets gray hair,
they're simply losing their pigments in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cortex region.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cortex, specifically, the
distribution of cortex is considered the
[SPEAKER_00]: most important component when attempting
to distinguish between different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is still class evidence,
not getting to individual evidence,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still important for different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microscopic examination can also reveal
conditions in shape of the root and the
[SPEAKER_00]: tip, and the cortex varies in its
thickness, its texture, and also its
[SPEAKER_00]: color, which is kind of important for that
identification purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see human hair, and we have on the
head, there could be on the body,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be different areas we're looking
at, and we do see a different difference
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cortex in the two images provided
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cortex, the pigment-granule
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is both looking at a tabby cap,
and again, looking towards the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: most is closer towards the root area,
and we can definitely see that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: differences in the cortex between these
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, there's also a slight
difference in magnification, so you're
[SPEAKER_00]: also seeing more detail in the cuticle
region of the hair in this image down
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting to the medulla, that center
portion interior-most area of the hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the most noticeable hair feature
in many species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medulla is that center region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the cuticle, the medulla is
characterized by importance in
[SPEAKER_00]: distinguishing between hairs of different
species, but there are often not useful in
[SPEAKER_00]: distinguishing between different people
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medulla may vary in its thickness,
connectivity, the opacity, that refers to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it broken into pieces?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it all continuous?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much light is able to pass through?
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, it could also be absent
in certain species as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, very important when looking at
class evidence is the medulla region of
[SPEAKER_00]: the hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medulla patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's three main characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have a continuous, an interrupted
or intermittent.
[SPEAKER_00]: More specifically, we could have
fragmented, or it could also just be
[SPEAKER_00]: absent, and that's basically relating into
no pattern, but would be important to
[SPEAKER_00]: note.
[SPEAKER_00]: The classification of the medulla.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see here again, we just only
have different classifications for
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and pattern forming at the
margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this can help us use this
information as class characteristics of
[SPEAKER_00]: the hair samples found and collected at a
potential crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also something called a medulla
index, and this describes the thickness of
[SPEAKER_00]: the medulla layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's calculated by measuring the
diameter of the medulla and dividing by
[SPEAKER_00]: the diameter of the hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here the medulla index of a human hair
is generally less than one third.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the medulla index, for animal hair,
is usually greater than one half.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can help be another form of
quantitative analysis when we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: classify different hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using the medulla index is one method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, there's a lot of
different types of ways to kind of look at
[SPEAKER_00]: hair, analyze hair, and understand hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully this provided you with a
little insight to all the options that are available.
