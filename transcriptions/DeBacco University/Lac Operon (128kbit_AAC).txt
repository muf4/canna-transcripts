[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to learn about the lac
operon, and also see a simulation on
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly how it works to get a better
understanding for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the lac operon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lac stands for lactose, and this is an
example of a sequence of genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an operon in general is a sequence of
genes, maybe found in many bacteria that
[SPEAKER_00]: encodes for enzymes needed to break down
lactose to glucose and galactose,
[SPEAKER_00]: so sugars can be utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Studies on the lac operon have been
important for genetic research.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lactose receptor protein control the
transcription of the lac operon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this operon, again, it is in bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do show the glasses of milk here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you drink a glass of milk,
you're activating your own lac operon,
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a good example here of taking
the lactose and with the lactase enzyme
[SPEAKER_00]: and breaking it down into galactose and
glucose, which can be absorbed by the body
[SPEAKER_00]: and other organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lac operon, the lactose operon
would be the full term here.
[SPEAKER_00]: An operon is the segment of DNA that
contains a cluster of genes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: transcribed as a unit and are involved in
lactose metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lac is short for lactose, the disaccharide
composed of galactose and glucose that is
[SPEAKER_00]: found in milk and other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I stressed before, note that
operons occur primarily in prokaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, you are a eukaryotic
organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while operons do occur mostly in
prokaryotes, this is a simulation that
[SPEAKER_00]: does provide a good model for gene
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take it for what it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're looking at the lac operon,
it's repressed when no lactose is present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cell doesn't want to make this
enzyme if there's nothing to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the absence of lactose, the lac
repressor binds to the operator.
[SPEAKER_00]: That repressor here is going to prevent
that gene from being made.
[SPEAKER_00]: The operator here is kind of like the
light switch that says go or don't go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by binding a repressor, it's going to
prevent anything from downstream of that
[SPEAKER_00]: from being expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So RNA polymerase cannot access the
promoter, therefore the lac operon is shut
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example, it's important to shut
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no lactose present in a high
glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glucose is a favored energy source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in low glucose and lactose not
available, again, the lac gene is also not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, lac operon is activated when lactose
is present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, now we have lactose being
available and we have low amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the presence of lactose,
the metabolite of the lactose is called
[SPEAKER_00]: allolactose binds to the repressor and
this induces a change in the shape of the
[SPEAKER_00]: repressor, making it fall off the
operator.
[SPEAKER_00]: This now will expose the operator so that
RNA polymerase can now bind to the
[SPEAKER_00]: promoter and essentially this gene or
these genes now are turned on and these
[SPEAKER_00]: will be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important for the cell to make
them for the bacteria cell because now
[SPEAKER_00]: lactose is available.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you a couple of scenarios here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about lactose being available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we want to have that gene strongly
expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these two following cases, we have
lactose not being available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore they are repressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're repressed for different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we have high glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cell is still getting energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is not a lot of energy available
regardless, but still not a lot of lactose
[SPEAKER_00]: or lactose being unavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those genes will not be expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have high glucose and lactose
being available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be some we call low basal
level gene expression because as I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, glucose is preferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the case where we have low glucose
and lactose being available, this is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be strongly expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is simply the bacteria cell producing
the genes that also will produce the
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins that are most efficient for its
current conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is that operon simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give you a link to it right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another video.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take a look at it, but I'm going
to go through the simulation now so you
[SPEAKER_00]: get an idea of exactly how this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so now we're here looking at the
simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see our legend here and we have our
ability to add lactose to the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have some breaks in our genetic
code.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to add that promoter region,
so that lack promoter region.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we add just a promoter region with
no gene, this is our RNA polymerase
[SPEAKER_00]: binding to that, but it can't make the
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here now I have the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I attach the gene there and
polymerase goes through, now it has that
[SPEAKER_00]: specific sequence to replicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gene will go through the process of
translation to form what this is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be is the repressor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our lacZ gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I insert the gene, it's all well and
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have a complete genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we don't have an area for
polymerase to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important that you add the
promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want to add that very important
operator.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that operator fits the
repressor here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not making the lacZ gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not making the lactase enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no lactose present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I add some lactose, you can see our
disaccharide here, when this comes through
[SPEAKER_00]: and binds the repressor, it changes its
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: It removes that repressor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I add a little more lactose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that repressor is removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can make that lacZ gene,
which is only going to go through the
[SPEAKER_00]: process of translation to form our lacZ
enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: This enzyme can go through and break down
the disaccharide into galactose and
[SPEAKER_00]: glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you'll notice that I haven't added any
more lactose, and we've broken down almost
[SPEAKER_00]: one more piece here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've broken down all of the lactose that
was present, and now the repressor is
[SPEAKER_00]: bound here and kind of stuck here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to prevent the enzyme from
being made.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very efficient way for the cell to
go through and not waste its energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if this bacteria cell goes through and
for whatever reason comes into an
[SPEAKER_00]: environment that's very high in lactose,
see if I flood the area with lactose,
[SPEAKER_00]: now what we're having is we need a lot of
these enzymes to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these repressors are being bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their shape has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't bind here to prevent the making
of that enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're now going to see a lot of enzymes
being made and produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very important those enzymes are
made and produced because we've got a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of this lactose present.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have off the charts amounts of lactose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But going through the process here,
we can see the enzymes doing its job
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple times breaking down the lactose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lactase enzymes doing their
job going through breaking everything
[SPEAKER_00]: down, still making more enzymes because
again, those repressors are bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a different shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't block that gene, which is
important for the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: High degree of lactose being present.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a lot of those enzymes present as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's helping this breakdown process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will continue until we notice
that there is basically not a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: lactose remaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, we have no need to produce the
lactase enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: The repressors will come back through
eventually, bind to the repressor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and reduce the amount of enzymes being
made until the events change where there
[SPEAKER_00]: will be some more lactose present.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see now we're overrun with
enzymes, but the repressor is binding,
[SPEAKER_00]: preventing any new ones from being made.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we take this one more step further,
look at lactose in transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the same situation, but here we
have the cell membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have lactose outside the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have inside our cell a repressor being
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me add our lacZ gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me add our promoter like we did and
our operator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So operator right now that will allow that
lacZ gene to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see our repressor being bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that gene that allowed to be made
didn't have the proper operator.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some enzyme here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though there's lactose present,
it is separated by the cell membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's one more gene here involved
with this operator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the lacY's gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this lacY gene occurs is allows this
kind of intermembrane protein to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you notice right now it's being
blocked, but these repressors can't bind
[SPEAKER_00]: forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eventually it detaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one's going to come in right
behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now what's going to happen is we're
now having the lacZ gene made to break
[SPEAKER_00]: down lactose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also seeing this lacY gene made.
[SPEAKER_00]: This protein is ultimately going to go,
this green protein is going to ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the cell and allow the passage of
that lactose from the outside of the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: to the inside so that enzyme can work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you'll notice the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I added the enzyme itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being transported.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's being broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're very efficiently using our
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I stop adding the lactose, we have no
reason to produce any more of the lacZ or
[SPEAKER_00]: the lactase enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see that that repressor is bound,
but now if one more time we've changed its
[SPEAKER_00]: conformational shape, we're going to make
another round of enzymes to break down
[SPEAKER_00]: these last bit of lactose that is present
inside the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these got in the cell and those
proteins on the outside of the cell are
[SPEAKER_00]: still present.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we cause a mutation, so for example,
if I take the lacY gene and I mutate it
[SPEAKER_00]: and basically remove it, we're no longer
making any repressors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we no longer make repressors,
that's going to cause some issues because
[SPEAKER_00]: when these finally degrade, the cell is
going to keep making these proteins even
[SPEAKER_00]: though there is no lactose present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important for gene regulation
that we don't want the cell to be wasting
[SPEAKER_00]: energy making all these proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure it's efficient
producing when it needs to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully this lac operon gives you
kind of that idea of just how important
[SPEAKER_00]: gene regulation is and some of the,
hopefully a simplified breakdown of the
[SPEAKER_00]: complexities of some of the steps
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a mutation in the kind of
repressor protein being made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have all these extra enzymes being
made when there is no lactose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cell right now is wasting energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure we have all of our
genes properly operating with functional
[SPEAKER_00]: promoters to allow the cell to be
efficient with its energy usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having gone through the simulation now,
hopefully that was helpful for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go through, I got a couple of
questions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it felt like you understood it,
why do genes require promoters?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the purpose of an operator?
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple other questions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to carry through the simulation that
I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got a couple other questions
here to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might want to pause the video,
take a look at, make sure you can answer
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can determine your level of
understanding when it comes to operators
[SPEAKER_00]: in regards to bacteria being able to break
down lactose.
