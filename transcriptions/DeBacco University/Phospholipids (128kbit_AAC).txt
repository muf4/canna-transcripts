[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're looking at the last
subcategory of lipids called
[SPEAKER_00]: phospholipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what one individual phospholipid
looks like, and this is what we call a
[SPEAKER_00]: phospholipid bilayer, where we see two
layers of these phospholipids coming
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very important for cell membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind there's a hydrophobic
tail, that's the lipid portion,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's kind of the fat portion we see
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be saturated or unsaturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a hydrophilic head group, which is the
phosphate group.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a charge here, it's a phosphate
group here, and that's hydrophilic,
[SPEAKER_00]: it likes water, and in the middle here it
dislikes water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phospholipid in general is a modified
fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the three fatty acids is
replaced by a phosphate in a small polar
[SPEAKER_00]: functional group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this polar portion is what makes it
hydrophilic, meaning it likes water,
[SPEAKER_00]: in comparison to the lipid portion here,
the hydrophobic tails.
[SPEAKER_00]: In water, phospholipids aggregate to form
a lipid bilayer, as we saw in the previous
[SPEAKER_00]: image, composed of a hydrophilic head and
two hydrophobic tails.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it is highlighted here in nice
colors and nice shapes, realize that there
[SPEAKER_00]: is this phosphate group, and then two
fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recognize the saturated one,
which has all single bonds, saturated with
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogens, keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an unsaturated one here, where there
is a single double bond here, but that
[SPEAKER_00]: still classifies it as unsaturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would be in the cis form here,
because they'd both be forming on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on with our phospholipids,
it's a major component in cell membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, they form a lipid bilayer,
which is semipermeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it means to be semipermeable is we
look here, we zoom in on this green area,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we look at one phospholipid here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This semipermeable cell membrane that's
generated in cells means that only certain
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules are able to diffuse across it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we see here, for example,
a semipermeable membrane, we see some
[SPEAKER_00]: holes here, allowing the small molecules
to go through, but not the larger ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the cell, as a result, has a lot of
proteins here, a line for signaling,
[SPEAKER_00]: a line for things to come in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's the main kind of barrier here
is this phospholipid bilayer, component of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, it doesn't prevent anything
from getting through, but it is what we
[SPEAKER_00]: call semipermeable, because only certain
molecules can diffuse across through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others need these protein carriers and
active transport to move them across.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, our phospholipids are a vital
function in coding cellular barriers,
[SPEAKER_00]: also aiding movement of vitamins,
nutrients, and fat-containing molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see these round portions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The liposome, as you notice, we have our
hydrophilic heads on the outside forming a
[SPEAKER_00]: bilayer and also forming a pocket on the
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cell here, is only one layer,
and we see all the hydrophobic tails
[SPEAKER_00]: pointed on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are both forming these kind of
spherical shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we commonly see in cells is the
bilayer sheet, and this is that bilayer
[SPEAKER_00]: here that's being semipermeable,
only allowing certain things into and out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need protein carriers, as we'll learn
about later, to help transport things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this bilayer acts as a wonderful
semipermeable barrier to the cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing them to control and regulate many
of the things coming both into and also
[SPEAKER_00]: leading the cell.
