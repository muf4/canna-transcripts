[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
why flower ID is important for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production will be covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: There also is another video on this
channel, which will go over exactly how to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify both male and female flowers on
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see pictured here a nice female
flower, but we're going to go over in this
[SPEAKER_00]: video lecture why flower identification is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we have those male versus
female flowers that we need to be mindful
[SPEAKER_00]: and well-versed in identifying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because cannabis plants produce
distinctive male and female plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are a diocese plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a male plant, or you're going to
have a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Female flowers or plants produce the buds
where the cannabinoids and terpenes are
[SPEAKER_00]: produced, and the plants are considered to
be very sought after by growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Male flowers or plants produce pollen,
which is needed for the formation of seed
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Male plants need to be removed from an
area of female plants to allow for female
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers to remain un-pollinated and
produce chemical compounds in the greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called the sensimila, or seedless
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: For if we have a male and a female plant
together, the female plant will then
[SPEAKER_00]: produce seeds if the pollen from the male
plant is received by the female flower
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are looking at the pre-flower
determinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there'll be another video going
over the details identifying those,
[SPEAKER_00]: both in images as well as in the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what if we get some feminized seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of growers are buying feminized
seed, and they think this is great and
[SPEAKER_00]: have to worry about male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you really need to ID plants if you
start with feminized seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, without a doubt, I would say yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if the seed is 99% feminized,
the seed's female still means one out of
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 will be male, or 100 out of 10,000
plants will be male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on how much scale you're
growing, that can have a great impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in large growing field, it's very
important as one male plant can produce
[SPEAKER_00]: high amounts of pollen and reduce the
productivity of female plants drastically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're only growing five,
six seeds, like a 99% chance, odds are
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have mostly female seeds,
but still wise to go through and be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to recognize what a male plant,
male flowers look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our large growing areas,
our operations, the large plant production
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities, flower divagation is very
important as one male can contaminate the
[SPEAKER_00]: female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put contaminate in quotes because it's
basically just producing pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will cause those females to produce
seeds and not cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeated walking of fields is important to
be sure to catch the males as soon as they
[SPEAKER_00]: can visually be identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some time, they don't immediately
just produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some time to catch those male
flowers before they will produce pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: that will be exposed to the environment
and potentially pollinate neighboring
[SPEAKER_00]: female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: For indoor operations, a one male plant
and an indoor operation can quickly spread
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen, especially via ventilation
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it should be removed very
quickly amongst identification because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's pretty much a closed environment can
spread that pollen very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for clones, ideally with clones,
they should all be of known, ideally
[SPEAKER_00]: female gender.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in some cases there can be an odd
male plants and knowing the difference is
[SPEAKER_00]: still important.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the producer of the clones
should be contacted to inform them that
[SPEAKER_00]: your identification, since it's not what
you would be expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buying clones, you're expecting female
plants and 100% female plants at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to let the producer know if you did
get a rogue male, just as good practice
[SPEAKER_00]: because ads are that might show that it
might be some confusion and their cloning
[SPEAKER_00]: practices may have when it reverted back,
but for the most part clones, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: expecting to get 100% female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to let the producer know if you did
get a rogue male, just as good practice
