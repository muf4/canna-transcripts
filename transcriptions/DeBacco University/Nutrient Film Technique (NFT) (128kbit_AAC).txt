[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at the
nutrient film technique which is involved
[SPEAKER_00]: with hydroponics, typically abbreviated
NFT.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in this diagram we have a
nutrient solution with an air stone to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it aerated, nutrient pump pumping
that nutrient solution here at the top
[SPEAKER_00]: level of a trough.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water then through gravity flows down
passing over the roots allowing plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake vital nutrients and then exiting
out the bottom here back into our
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes timers can be used to run this,
other times this will be run for a
[SPEAKER_00]: continuous 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this NFT technique allows for a high
degree of detail and can maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the very same setup here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This supplies aerated nutrient solution to
the roots of the plant and the plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: a strong root system are established with
a capillary mat and are fed a continually
[SPEAKER_00]: aerated nutrient solution in a channel
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows for the recirculation of that
nutrient solution with a holding
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: The size of that reservoir will depend on
the amount or area that you'll be kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: running the nutrient solution through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irrigation is typically done for a
continued 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will have timers that will turn off
for a short period of time, but many times
[SPEAKER_00]: is run for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are commonly grown in rows that are
tightly covered to allow for a high
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity within the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we see the same basic setup
here, pumping that water through and
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing it to drain back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the roots dry out, they will die and
this is why it's important to maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: that high degree of humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also concern about the pumps and
the spread of disease and this is why
[SPEAKER_00]: these areas should be covered and should
be monitored so that we're not spreading
[SPEAKER_00]: disease throughout the entire operation
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now because of this or a variety of
reasons, this technique has actually lost
[SPEAKER_00]: popularity and is typically used with
hobby growers or those that are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has lost popular in a large scale for
the fear of quick spreading of disease in
[SPEAKER_00]: a recirculating solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's been shied away from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now inert media like Rockwell is the
preferred source for large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Provide plants with a continual access to
water, but it can be more beneficial to
[SPEAKER_00]: have specific irrigation events for
fruiting crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another reason why it's been lost
its popularity on large scale production
[SPEAKER_00]: is if a crop is looking at producing a
fruit or a heavy carbohydrate load,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might be beneficial to actually have
some dry down events and have some
[SPEAKER_00]: re-irrigation events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here with this 24 hour system with this
continual flow of nutrients, it might be
[SPEAKER_00]: best for the consistencies of leafy
greens, but not so much for those looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at high fruit load stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
