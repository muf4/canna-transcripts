[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
we're going to be looking at hand-watering
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while this might be a little bit of a
labor-intensive task, going over some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the specifics here for hand-watering in
this presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the advantage is it can be
plant specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hand-watering allows for individual plants
to get watered individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also requires someone to visit each
plant each day, which can be important for
[SPEAKER_00]: scouting for disease or insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of just kind of turning on the
irrigation system and having the whole row
[SPEAKER_00]: watered at once, going into each
individual plant can be great for
[SPEAKER_00]: monitoring purposes and help ensure every
plant gets the water that they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the importance with
hand-watering of nozzle selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the stage of plant
development, growers may want to change
[SPEAKER_00]: the nozzle they use when they water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many options, not just one
option, as many growers think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, just a nozzle at the end of a hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a lot of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early on, keep in mind that plants are
fragile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an even watering nozzle held so the
water points up and gently falls down is
[SPEAKER_00]: advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later in the season, volume may be more
important to deliver, so more water,
[SPEAKER_00]: to water more plants in a shorter period
of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why you may want to make these
different changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would advise in generally against the
high pressure nozzles, as we see here,
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used more for cleaning and pressure
washing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of want that nice kind of simulation
of that nice gentle rain flow there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't use a nozzle, it can kind of
create a lot of soil splash or splashes in
[SPEAKER_00]: general, which might not be advantageous
for your growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to ensure consistent water
delivered to the plants from day to day
[SPEAKER_00]: and also over the entire growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's requirements will change,
so the grower needs to make the necessary
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustments when needed to avoid plant
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because they need X amount of seconds
per water when they first starting out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to make sure you're adjusting to
those plant needs as those plants grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: change over their growth cycle to ensure
you're delivering consistency to match the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant demand and not shorting the plants
or overwarning the plants to ensure that
[SPEAKER_00]: nice even growth and to not overly stress
them or potentially cause an increased
[SPEAKER_00]: chance for diseases at the root level.
