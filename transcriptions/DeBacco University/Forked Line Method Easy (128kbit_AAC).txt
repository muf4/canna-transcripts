[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, if you're watching this video,
you're probably watching for one of two
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: First could be you stumbled upon this
video first, or two, you came across my
[SPEAKER_00]: other fork line method video and wanted a
little bit of an easier version.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to explain the same method
and go through the very similar process so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can gain some experience with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to be able to get comfortable
with the fork line method and get away
[SPEAKER_00]: from the punnet squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a more reliable method and it's
easier and quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to look at a tri-hybrid
cross using the fork line method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this same can be applied to more or
less complex equations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part is you need to understand
what a monohybrid cross is and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: foil method from math class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the first, outer, and inner last
to distribute things and not use a punnet
[SPEAKER_00]: square.
[SPEAKER_00]: Problem is a pollinating plant has a
genotype big A big A, big B big B,
[SPEAKER_00]: big C little C, is crossed with another
plant of genotype which is homozygous
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant for A, heterozygous for B,
and heterozygous for C.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the expected genotype frequencies
of the offspring or seeds produced from
[SPEAKER_00]: this resulting cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now since both parents are homozygous
dominant for the A allele, the process
[SPEAKER_00]: shown isn't quite as efficient as it could
be but this is intended to help those that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be struggling to understand this
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Odds are you probably haven't seen this in
middle school or anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be your first exposure to it
and that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to be sure that you can
understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to do a punnet square,
it looks something like this which gets
[SPEAKER_00]: very complex and very hard to keep track
of things and increases the odds for an
[SPEAKER_00]: error.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to try to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fork line method is a lot cleaner and
a lot easier to understand once you get
[SPEAKER_00]: over the initial hurdle of seeing it
something different than the punnet
[SPEAKER_00]: squares you might be used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So step one, identify the trihybrid cross
into three monohybrid crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: One for the A alleles, one for the B
alleles, one for the C alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember we're going to use the foil
method and not punnet squares to generate
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at plants, so we're looking at
generating the genotype for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the first one,
because both parents in this case are
[SPEAKER_00]: homozygous dominant, 100% of the time
that's going to be the resulting of the
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called true breeding in that
sense, for that allele at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the B, because we have a homozygous
dominant and heterozygous, half the time
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll have big B big B and the other half
the time will be heterozygous,
[SPEAKER_00]: big B little b.
[SPEAKER_00]: C gets a little more complex here with
both being heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quarter will be homozygous dominant,
the other quarter will be homozygous
[SPEAKER_00]: recessive, and half the time it will be
heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we put all these genotype
frequencies together?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well first off, we have to identify the
possible combinations of genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This requires the pairing of genotypes
from all the monohybrid crosses previously
[SPEAKER_00]: completed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're talking about plants,
we're looking at pollen grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 100% of the time it's always going to
give a homozygous dominant for A,
[SPEAKER_00]: half will be homozygous dominant for B,
half will be heterozygous for B,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then for C remember a quarter of the
time it'll be homozygous dominant,
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter of the time homozygous recessive,
and half the time heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start with the fork line method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well since 100% of the time we have big A
big A, we just write that one down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we want to distribute that to our
alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that half the time it'll be
homozygous dominant for B, the other half
[SPEAKER_00]: heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to get a little bit more complex with
this C alleles, and we notice that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're including all three of those
possibilities for all three of the
[SPEAKER_00]: options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to get to the seed genotype,
we simply multiply these percentages or
[SPEAKER_00]: these fractions right across.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice by doing that, it's easy because
the first one's always one.
[SPEAKER_00]: One times a half times a quarter would be
an eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: One times a half times a half will be a
quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: One times a half times a quarter again
will be an eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are we carrying those numbers,
and I color coded those accordingly,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're also carrying around those alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that one is that big A big
A indicated here, the half is the
[SPEAKER_00]: homozygous dominant for B, and the quarter
is the homozygous dominant for C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how we develop our seed
genotypes with this fork line method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see once you get comfortable
with this how quick and easy it can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot more reliable than a point
squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the simplified version here,
we take these fractions and turn them into
[SPEAKER_00]: percents.
[SPEAKER_00]: One divided by eight times a hundred will
give you twelve and a half percent,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you do that for the rest here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, getting back to the question,
what are the expected genotype frequencies
[SPEAKER_00]: of the offspring of seeds produced?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that would be indicated right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice you have all of these
percentages with these genotypes perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: aligned and all set to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to add these up, you would
also get a hundred percent, which is a way
[SPEAKER_00]: to check to make sure you calculated or
accounted for all the seeded genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you want to test your skills,
you can go to my other fork line method
[SPEAKER_00]: example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll look at this cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be sure to put a link in the
description so you can look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key difference here is the alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: One parent is heterozygous, the other one
is homozygous recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see how that changes things,
and hopefully that helps you better
[SPEAKER_00]: understand and get more comfortable with
this fork line method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
