[SPEAKER_00]: So in this tobacco university video,
I'm going to talk about how simple
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen peroxide can be utilized to help
increase seed germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you what percentage to use based
on the research study and how you can
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve that same concentration with
various products you might be purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at how improved
cannabis seed germination with hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide can be accomplished.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, give you just a little
background on growers' usage of hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers may use it as a simple
pour-through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll cause a lot of bubbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be effective for root or
substrate-based diseases, but this lecture
[SPEAKER_00]: really we're going to focus on just
germination rates that some growers may
[SPEAKER_00]: already be utilizing this particular
product for other purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrogen peroxide is common.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used in most first aid situations,
typically a 3% solution as a mild
[SPEAKER_00]: antiseptic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used to prevent infection of myocut
scrapes and burns.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product works by releasing oxygen when
it's applied to the defected area,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you see this kind of bubble foaming
that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It removes the dead skin and basically
cleans the area, and that's a sign that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to make note that if you are
purchasing concentrated hydrogen peroxide,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically 25 to 35%, you get that directly
on your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically turns your skin white,
as seen in the image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's highly concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 3% would just cause the bubbling
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: With hydrogen peroxide, remember that
light can break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's typically found in a
light block bottle, because that can
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the concentration over time,
and there's usually a use by date stated
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind if you are choosing to
utilize this particular product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to the research article here
that talks about this germination,
[SPEAKER_00]: different cannabis seeds soaked in
different concentrations of hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some of the data that they were
looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: The germination of six-month-old seeds of
blueberry of cannabis variety in
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations of hydrogen peroxide
solution, as well as a water control.
[SPEAKER_00]: A here, the top picture here, is a
representative photographs of germination
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and seedlings in H2O2, hydrogen
peroxide, for various concentrations of
[SPEAKER_00]: water in day one, day two, day three,
and day four.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see their actual data here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at water right across,
this is what it looked like after one day,
[SPEAKER_00]: two days, three days, and four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that in relation to the other
concentrations of hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down here, panel B is a comparison of the
germination percentages with those
[SPEAKER_00]: different concentrations of hydrogen
peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here, it puts the visualness of
the data here into actual numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we see something very distinctive
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the middle bar here, the second
bar I should say, is the 1%, and that had
[SPEAKER_00]: the quickest rate of germination compared
to the other concentrations and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: water control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they took this up and they did a
five-year-old seed, so germination of
[SPEAKER_00]: five-year-old seeds of the phenola and X59
varieties in 1% hydrogen peroxide solution
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the water control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see, again, the water compared to
the two, compared to the other two
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties in 1%, both varieties responded
very well to that 1% in that comparison of
[SPEAKER_00]: germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a 1% peroxide solution media in
water control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is shown here in the mean with five
seeds being tried here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each replicate, around 30 seeds,
were used in total.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a little comparison there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always look at the article if you want
more of the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growth and survival of hydrogen peroxide
solutions germinated in an MS media.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is looking at more of the Petri dish
kind of look at things, but again,
[SPEAKER_00]: same basic thing, water from the first day
they were placed, basically day zero to
[SPEAKER_00]: day one to day three there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day zero is just after transferred to the
MS media plates after they're soaking,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then 24 hours after and 72 hours after
transplanted to that medium there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's just typical Petri dish
general multipurpose media that was
[SPEAKER_00]: utilized there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing the results yet again of that
1% solution showing visually that best
[SPEAKER_00]: rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the study conclude?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you get to the bottom of the study
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: To improve germination rates of your
cannabis seeds, soak the seeds overnight
[SPEAKER_00]: in a 1% hydrogen peroxide solution in a
dark room at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great for situations that require
sterility, such as tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what basically this study
concluded.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, how does this kind of relate to
your germination rates?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can this help benefit you?
[SPEAKER_00]: While some growers may soak their seeds
overnight, this is typically not often
[SPEAKER_00]: advised, though shown it can work,
but this information still can be useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply instead of soaking your seeds in
plain water for whatever duration of time
[SPEAKER_00]: you choose to use, you can simply add
hydrogen peroxide to create a 1% solution
[SPEAKER_00]: as you're soaking your seeds, and that can
help improve your germination rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question now becomes is how do you get
to that 1% rate?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use the simple chemistry
here, C1V1 equals C2V2.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentration of your starting stock
solution with your initial volume will
[SPEAKER_00]: equal the concentration of your final
dilute solution with your final volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a typical bottle here
that's 3%, if you have 16 ounces of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you get that 1% solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: In short, starting with your solution,
there's three times as strong as you need,
[SPEAKER_00]: so taking 16 ounces of stock solution,
adding 32 ounces of water will result in
[SPEAKER_00]: 48 ounces total of a 1% solution,
and you can see basically I went through
[SPEAKER_00]: and calculated that right here,
basically solving for V2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another part here, what if you have
that concentrated?
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, 32% food-grade hydrogen
peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're using that same 16 ounces
of the food-grade hydrogen peroxide,
[SPEAKER_00]: in short, you're going to be taking 16
ounces of that stock solution and adding
[SPEAKER_00]: 496 ounces of water, which results in 512
ounces 4 gallons of a 1% solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be applicable on very large scales,
but 4 gallons of a 1% solution might be
[SPEAKER_00]: more than you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you still have that same concentrated
solution and now you're only going to use
[SPEAKER_00]: 2 ounces of that, what percentage of water
would you need to add?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, 2 ounces of your stock solution
here, 62 ounces of water would make a 64,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably more reasonable volume there of a
1% solution that you can utilize to soak
[SPEAKER_00]: your seeds in to help improve germination
rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hope this helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have this solution already,
give it a try.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on the trial yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how it helps out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But start with that 1% solution because
that's what the data shows is the most
[SPEAKER_00]: effective.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
