[SPEAKER_00]: While many growers will tell you how to
root cutting successfully, very rarely do
[SPEAKER_00]: you see anyone that relates it to
scientific published research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully you've come here to Tobacco
University for just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we intend to provide here
of the rooting success rate of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cuttings research to give you the best
methods to increase your odds of success
[SPEAKER_00]: at rooting new clones or vegetative
cuttings from a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the video here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, here is the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to find a little bit more
details or information, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide you here with kind of a brief
overview of this particular article in
[SPEAKER_00]: this video lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, realize that there's many
variables here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers often wonder what the impact would
be of different rooting conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If conditions are favorable, there would
be very likely to be some degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the goal for growers is to
maximize the production.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole intention here is to show
you some comparisons, but show you how to
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize your rooting potential there in
your cannabis clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, looking at cannabis plant
material and factors explained.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, again, part of that study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis was actually used as part of
the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always hard to find that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to provide here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuttings were taken at the length of about
13 centimeters with three fully expanded
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves from stock plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuttings were taken at the ends of
axillary limbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cut at a 45 degree angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each cutting was rooted in a 5.7
centimeter wide, 5.7 centimeter tall peat
[SPEAKER_00]: based jiffy pot containing promix,
a PG, organic growing substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this gives you just some
background for this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full factorial complete randomized design
with four factors, rooting hormone,
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf number, cutting position and leaf tip
removal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two levels per factor in 10 replications
per factor combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a pretty extensive study that
really touched on many of the things you
[SPEAKER_00]: hear growers say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I cut the leaves, not cut the
leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many leaves should I have?
[SPEAKER_00]: This study gets into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For leaf number, cuttings either had one
fully expanded leaf removed, two leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: remaining, or were left with three total
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: For cutting position, cuttings from
terminal shoots were taken from either an
[SPEAKER_00]: apical position, basically node 10 or
higher on the plant, or from what was
[SPEAKER_00]: determined to be a basal position,
which is below node 10 on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: For leaf tip removal treatment,
the portion of the leaf tips, about
[SPEAKER_00]: one-third of the leaf area was removed
from fully expanded leaves or the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: were left uncut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, for the rooting hormone
factor, we're looking at the base,
[SPEAKER_00]: about five centimeters of each stem was
dipped into either 0.2% indole-3-butyric
[SPEAKER_00]: acid gel, or in 0.2% will extract rooting
gel for another source of comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these are probably some things
you've heard from a lot of growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at some of the data provided to
get into what the results showed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's also important to understand the
propagation environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can also play a large factor into
your cloning and rooting success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trays were randomly arranged in a
walk-in growth chamber and initially
[SPEAKER_00]: misted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relative humidity in the first zero to
four days was 95%.
[SPEAKER_00]: From five to eight days, that was reduced
to 80%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for nine to 12 days, that was reduced
further to 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature was maintained about 24
degrees Celsius for day and night for the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluorescent lighting was used to maintain
an 18-hour photo period, and the light
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity was slowly increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PAR readings from that zero to five
days again at 50 micromoles, day six to
[SPEAKER_00]: day nine, 80, and day 10 to day 12,
150, and a PAR reading of those micromoles
[SPEAKER_00]: in meters per second to give you an idea
of the conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The harvest determination, so the bottom
of the trays was observed daily from seven
[SPEAKER_00]: days after and onwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: For treating roots and cuttings were
harvested at 12 days when approximately
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% or more of the cutting showed visible
roots at the bottom of the tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these are some of the parameters
that were set forth for the experiment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the results then are based off this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rooting assessment, looking at how
well those plants may have rooted or may
[SPEAKER_00]: not have rooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, successful rooted cuttings were
assigned to either two classifications
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the degree of advantageous roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: A root quality index abbreviated in this
study RQI, score of one or two,
[SPEAKER_00]: was assigned by a third party without
knowledge of applied treatments based on
[SPEAKER_00]: visual reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the top image right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a one and here's a two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before RQI measurements, the substrate was
washed in root cuttings with RO water to,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, allow for good visual inspection
because that's how the roots were assessed
[SPEAKER_00]: visually, and that's how the study was
conducted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rooting success rate of cannabis cuttings,
if you look at some of the data here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rooting success rate of cannabis
cuttings with about 80 cuttings looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut leaves had about one third of leaf
tips removed to give you an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuttings from terminal shoots,
either April cuttings, again, greater than
[SPEAKER_00]: node 10, and basil cuttings less than node
10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those April cuttings are equal to or
greater than node 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rooting hormones, there's a synthetic
hormone or an organic hormone,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is willow based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bars within each factor bearing different
letters are significantly different at p
[SPEAKER_00]: less than 0.05 using chi-squared contrast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So measured in a binomial scale in which
any visible advantage is root formation
[SPEAKER_00]: was considered rooted to calculate as
percentage of cuttings with roots in each
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this background say about the
data provided right below me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can notice if we look at the leaf
number, whether you use two leaves or
[SPEAKER_00]: three leaves, statistically there was no
difference between those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether using a basil cutting or an apical
cutting, again, no statistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Difference between those.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, with cutting the tips or not
cutting the leaf tips, there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to get the increased rooting success,
it is suggested here by the data to not
[SPEAKER_00]: cut the leaves there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to whether applying the
organic or the synthetic rooting hormone,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, the synthetic hormone
definitely had a much greater rooting
[SPEAKER_00]: success than the organic one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, leaf number, where you took the
cuttings from, not major difference,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least statistically based on this
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uncutting the leaves and using synthetic
hormone definitely did make a
[SPEAKER_00]: statistically different improvement in
rooting success.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the root quality index of
the cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, 80 were used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the cut and the uncut leaves
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the bars within each
factor being different letters,
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly different at p less than
0.05 using chi-squared contrast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the, again, same basic pattern
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at leaf number and synthetic
pattern here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Providing definitely the greatest
difference there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rooting success rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at where we took those
cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a number of 40 individual plants
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut leaves had about 130 leaf tips
removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuttings from the terminal shoots,
again, the apical equal to or greater than
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basil cuttings less or under 0.10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the same statistical analysis
applied there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see the example of looking at
the basil or apical here, shoot tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at whether you cut or uncut the
leaves as if the leaves were cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, if you do cut the tips of
the leaves, the apical area did show an
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement in rooting success.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you leave them uncut,
it doesn't matter where you take them
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Statistically, there is no difference in
the rooting success rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the research summary here?
[SPEAKER_00]: What have we learned from looking at all
this data and how can we apply that to our
[SPEAKER_00]: own potential cannabis clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: The rooting hormone of 0.2% IBA gel
delivered higher rooting success rate than
[SPEAKER_00]: the 0.2% will extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be advised to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cutting 30% of the leaf tips reduced
rooting success rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is not advised to cut those leaf
tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three leaves had a higher root quality
compared to two leaves without influencing
[SPEAKER_00]: rooting success rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the position of cutting on the stock
plant did not influence either rooting
[SPEAKER_00]: success rate or the root quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to go back to some of the
previous slides or pause the video to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at those charts presented in a little bit
more detail yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But lastly, to maximize rooting success,
what's the quick general summary here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to take plant material from either
the apical or basal positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure the cuttings have at
least three fully expanded leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not want to cut the tips of the
leaves off at any point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will, again, reduce your rooting
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to dip the cuttings in IBA
rooting hormone to help increase your and
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize your rooting success and quality
cuttings that you can produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here it is supported with scientific
research doing comparisons between
[SPEAKER_00]: different methods growers may use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully you found this helpful and
it will improve your rooting success on
[SPEAKER_00]: the clones that you take.
