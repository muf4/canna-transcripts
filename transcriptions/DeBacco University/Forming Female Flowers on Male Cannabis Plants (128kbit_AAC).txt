[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be looking at forming
female flowers on male cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how is this possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take you through some of the
steps, point you to our research paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this can be very important for the
breeding process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the research article here,
you can research it on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a copy of that research.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find some more details here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to provide a summary here for
you, but this is the source and where some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the images and information were
gathered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, looking at self-fertilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while self-fertilizing a plant can help
retain certain genetic traits,
[SPEAKER_00]: this can be quite a challenge with
dioecious plants such as cannabis that
[SPEAKER_00]: produces distinctive male and distinctive
female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since each plant only produces one type of
flower, this creates an inherent problem
[SPEAKER_00]: with self-fertilizing, a lot easier with
some other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers may just decide to clone the
plant, but if this does not allow for the
[SPEAKER_00]: production of seeds, which may be desired.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to find a way to kind of be
able to self-fertilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this research does allow this as an
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we determine the male plant
primordia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that kind of mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that referring to?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of like the early flower
indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that primordia determine that section,
that's early flower development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that initial formation does
occur, male primordia can be identified by
[SPEAKER_00]: their curved claw shaped, which was
followed by the different variation of
[SPEAKER_00]: round pointed flower buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time of primordia formation,
the primordia were formed between the
[SPEAKER_00]: stipule and the petiole under the shoot
tip, as far as where to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: As time goes on, leaves become smaller,
decreased and more flowers were formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important note to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of gives you some visual
indication here of the female and male
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, kind of how they look at that very
early stage, very similar and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: become differentiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the plant treatments here in this
trial, seven to 14 days after the
[SPEAKER_00]: primordia formation, the male plants were
treated with 500 milligrams per liter of
[SPEAKER_00]: ethron to induce female flower formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dilution rates are provided at the end and
how you go about calculating those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just important consideration there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Male plants at the time of ethron
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in figure A, male plants at the
time of the ethron treatment after male
[SPEAKER_00]: primordia formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of can see that located right down
here at that stage of development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Image B shows that seven days later,
what the progression is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we see 14 days later again,
the leaf and the male flowers becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: much more distinctive two weeks after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, female flowers on male plants,
you know, how does this go about what kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of negatives do we see here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, female flowers and male plants have
five stigmas in contrast to the dual
[SPEAKER_00]: stigma of female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an important note there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Male planted seeds were lighter and
smaller than those from female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the male plant seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's those for the corresponding female
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are smaller and they are in lighter
in coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although germinates are lower in these
smaller seeds compared to normal seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: from female plants as that source of
comparison, the seeds from the male
[SPEAKER_00]: germinated, they still germinate and grow
into seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though the percentage of
germination might be less, they still can
[SPEAKER_00]: produce plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very important, again,
for that breeding process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see female flowers on a female
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the normal to kind of expect or
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see the male and female flowers
induced by the ahron treatment on the male
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, we see male flowers on a male
plant, which would be normal or control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this would be a normal female
plant, a normal male plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here we see the treatment and how
we get that slight, you know, difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between the two because we're inducing
those female flowers to form on a male
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this ahron treatment is the
conclusions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're looking at the treatment to
male plants that soon after the primordial
[SPEAKER_00]: formation will be good strategy and
breeding program to breed inbred lines of
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp by self-fertilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows that plant to then produce
pollen that otherwise we would need a
[SPEAKER_00]: separate plant for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's allowing that kind of closed loop
within the genetic lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do I go about calculating,
how do I go about treating this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here I'm going to describe the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're calculating that 500
milligrams per liter of the ahron here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part one, I'm going to take you through a
couple parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example product here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So note that the goal is 500 milligrams
per liter, which is a 0.05% solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example here, this product listed
is 21.7% ahron.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same as saying 200 milligrams per
liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to use this equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've done any science, particularly
chemistry, you might be familiar with this
[SPEAKER_00]: equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: C1 V1 equals C2 V2.
[SPEAKER_00]: The C1 is the concentration of the stock
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: V1 is the volume to be removed or alquoted
out from the concentrated stock solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: C2 is the final concentration of the
diluted solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And V2 is the final volume of the diluted
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the volume that result after V1
from the stock solution has been diluted
[SPEAKER_00]: with whatever you're diluting it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's water to achieve the total diluted
volume of V2.
[SPEAKER_00]: An alternate and commonly used notation
for this equation is M1 V1 equals M2 V2,
[SPEAKER_00]: where M is used in place of C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might be familiar with it presented
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's run through an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that goal still is the
same 500 milligrams per liter,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that is what was used in the
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the same starting material here
that's 21.7%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I went through and show you the
calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using the C1 V1 equals C2 V2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would be C1 times V1 equals C2
times V2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill in our knowns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're creating a 500 milligram per
liter solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the purposes here, I said we're
going to make a total liter, one liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have the concentration here of our
product is 21.7%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would equal 217,000 milligrams
per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We simply go through and we multiply these
two numbers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go through, we would then divide by
here and we get V1 would equal 0.002304
[SPEAKER_00]: liters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the kind of concentration or
volume I should say that we're using of
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular concentration of solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that look?
[SPEAKER_00]: And taking it the next step, the final
step here, the part three, note that that
[SPEAKER_00]: liter amount is the same as using our
conversion factors, 2.304 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to aliquot exactly 2.304
milliliters of the stock solution and
[SPEAKER_00]: dilute it with water so that there's a
final volume of one liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically what you'll do is you'll aliquot
that 2.304 milliliters and then fill it up
[SPEAKER_00]: to a one liter mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will yield a one liter of dilute
solution with a final solid concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: of 500 milligrams per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note the final volume returns to the total
solution volume, which is the combination
[SPEAKER_00]: volume of the stock solution and the
volume of the water used for dilution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why typically you might add some
water and the 2.30 and fill it up to
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly one liter because that's your
final solution there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to try this out yourself,
this is an example product here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find another product that has a
different percentage, you can simply
[SPEAKER_00]: follow these same steps with a different
percentage and calculate the exact amount
[SPEAKER_00]: that you need to aliquot to create your
one liter solution of that would be still
[SPEAKER_00]: 500 milligrams per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this was helpful and gives you a
little bit of a scientific background here
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're looking at breeding cannabis
plants.
