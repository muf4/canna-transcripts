[SPEAKER_00]: Have you considered using mycorrhizae and
part of your cannabis plant production
[SPEAKER_00]: process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, tune in to this tobacco university
video to learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into using
mycorrhizae for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what is mycorrhizae?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it literally means kind of a fungus
of the root and describes a mutually
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial relationship between the plant
and root fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is where roots grow, they're able to
absorb nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when they have the advantage of the
mycorrhizae fungal hyphae, they can
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch out and they can have access to a
greater portion of soil, greater portion
[SPEAKER_00]: of substrate so they can pull in more
water and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil fungal filaments colonize in this
soil area here, and they also colonize
[SPEAKER_00]: with the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They improve nutrient water absorption
greater than the roots can without this
[SPEAKER_00]: symbiotic relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Approximately 95% of plant species on the
planet form a symbiotic relationship with
[SPEAKER_00]: the mycorrhizae fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the reason why this is called a
symbiotic relationship is while the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is getting more nutrients, the fungus is
collecting more and giving more nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plant, the fungus has to get
something in return.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fungus is able to get sugars from the
plant because it has leaves above the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: surface so it can photosynthesize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this mutual relationship is the fungus
says, I'll give you nutrients and the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant says, I'll give you sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why they both benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of products that come in not
inoculated with mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mycorrhizae can be found added to many
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are even products that contain
concentrated levels for growers to make
[SPEAKER_00]: specific additions, particularly if
they're doing clones or seedlings,
[SPEAKER_00]: then go through and add inoculants of
these mycorrhizae products, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: some products coming pre-inoculated with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is due to customer demand and state
benefits of this fungus can have on
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I often just one word of caution
when we're looking at mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis grown in mycorrhizae inoculates
soils with cadmium, nickel and chromium-4
[SPEAKER_00]: have been shown to and quote,
significantly enhanced the translocation
[SPEAKER_00]: of all of the three metals from the root
to shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The possibility to increase metal
accumulation in shoot is very interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: for phyto extraction purposes since most
high production biomass plants such as
[SPEAKER_00]: non-mycorrhizae hemp retain most heavy
metals in the roots, limiting their
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the reference article here if
you want to look at it in more detail,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is showing that mycorrhizae has
potential to increase the translocation of
[SPEAKER_00]: some heavy metals from just the root
structure into the shoots and upper
[SPEAKER_00]: portions of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just a word of caution there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the benefits if you're adding
mycorrhizae to cannabis in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: in growing substrates, they're heavily
amended and typically aggressively fed
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the growing cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The benefits of adding mycorrhizae are
likely reduced below economic returns,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning if you're feeding the plants
anyway with a lot of water, and water that
[SPEAKER_00]: contains nutrient solutions, the demand
for the plant to try to have to go out and
[SPEAKER_00]: scavenge for those nutrients are going to
be reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, the true benefit of adding
mycorrhizae might be reduced as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there'll be no harm come from
adding this fungus to growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: must determine if it's worth the added
cost when it comes to return on
[SPEAKER_00]: investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is just something else to
consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it can help the plant gather more
nutrients, if you're doing a heavy feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: of those plants anyway, the true benefits
of adding mycorrhizae might be reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the true benefit of adding
mycorrhizae might be reduced as well.
So again, the true benefit of adding
mycorrhizae might be reduced.
