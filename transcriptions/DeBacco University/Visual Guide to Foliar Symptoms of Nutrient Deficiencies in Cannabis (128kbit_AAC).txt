[SPEAKER_00]: You're noticing your plant doesn't look
quite right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this Debaco University video can
provide you a great visual guide to foliar
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms of nutrient deficiencies in
cannabis plants to help you identify the
[SPEAKER_00]: issue that might be going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the visual guide
here, foliar symptoms and help provide you
[SPEAKER_00]: a diagnosis as well as a potential way to
correct the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, some of these images are
based off the research article here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to get into the research
article, in more detail, I provide the
[SPEAKER_00]: citation here so you can do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just some general reminders is that
nutrient mobility in the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: for mobile nutrients, they move to new
growth areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means deficiency symptoms will first
be seen in older leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: In comparison to immobile nutrients that
don't move to new growth, these
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies will be first seen in the
newer growth regions of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about classifying nutrients,
our primary nutrients are nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus and potassium, and they
contribute to plant nutrient content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Function of plant enzymes and biochemical
processes and integrity of plant cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your secondary nutrients are your calcium,
your magnesium and your sulfur,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these are needed in smaller amounts
than the primary nutrients, leading us
[SPEAKER_00]: finally to micronutrients, which are
necessary for plant survival, but are
[SPEAKER_00]: needed in very small micro quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look about fertilizers,
chelated or chelated fertilizers are
[SPEAKER_00]: preferred since it will enhance nutrient
uptake and improve efficiency and
[SPEAKER_00]: utilization, and the goal is plant
available nutrients, and some of them also
[SPEAKER_00]: are better applied foliarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, if you can find a
chelated form of a nutrient, that is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now nutrient classification is just
providing you this table here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at our nutrients,
whether it's a macro or a micro,
[SPEAKER_00]: the uptake form and chemical form and
ions, it's mobility in the plant and the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people forget, we're going to
focus, of course, on the plant mobility,
[SPEAKER_00]: but soil mobility can also play a factor
into your odds that you see a deficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: or ways about going correcting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, looking at the study,
we've got to start with the control plant
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's no nutrient deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at A, here's week five,
week six, week seven, and then week eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: While in week eight, fan leaves developed
increasing levels of foliar chlorosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In here, this is considered the control
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really looking at the
inflorescence of the flowers, the fan
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we want to see them good,
but here to the end, they're in good
[SPEAKER_00]: shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a last reminder, we are looking at
a plant, so there will be some variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here with the sunflowers,
there's going to be some variability plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to plant, so I'm going to try to show you
the major or the textbook images,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will, they should use for
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with a nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at here, A, we're looking at
week three, lower canopy foliar issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen deficiency, plants starting to
yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be a little hard to see,
but we're having a lightening of that
[SPEAKER_00]: green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will typically start in the lower
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at week four, looking at week
four, the progression of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency symptoms of the fan leaves from
mild, which is on the right, to the most
[SPEAKER_00]: severe, which is of course here on the
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at C here, the whole leaf
chlorosis developing in fan leaves of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lower two thirds of the plant canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for week five, almost the entire
senescence of fan leaves, stem brown and
[SPEAKER_00]: yellowing, and beginning of sugar leaf
chlorosis in nitrogen deficient plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a really advanced form of yellowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, it might be a little hard
to see here, but that lightening,
[SPEAKER_00]: that green, and different varieties will
have different deepness to their green
[SPEAKER_00]: coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we go out correcting the nitrogen
deficiency, and I'll do this for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember it is a primary mobile nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use 100 to 120 parts per million of
nitrogen fertilizer as the target
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have other videos that go about how
to calculate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your nitrates versus your nitrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember nitrates dissolve in water and
therefore move about the soil with the
[SPEAKER_00]: movement of soil water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nitrites are not a stable intermediate
and this is not able to be used by the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ammonia can be taken up by the plant and
nitrates can be moved, but nitrates
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also looking at ammonia versus
ammonium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ammonia has the highest nitrogen content
of any commercial fertilizer, about 82%
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it is delivered as a gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be injected about four to
eight inches, 10 to 20 centimeters below
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it will react with soil water to form
ammonium, which can be utilized by the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: For other growers, calcium nitrate is
recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's blood meal, there's albacuana,
there's ureas.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also options, but with ureas
like nitrates, urea needs to dissolve in
[SPEAKER_00]: and move through water soil and can be
lost through leaching if not converted to
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonia and then ammonium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This conversion of ammonia takes about two
to four days when soil moisture and
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature are favorable for plant
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower temperatures slow the process,
which will continue down even to freezing
[SPEAKER_00]: because they need the microbes to be able
to work that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, in outdoor applications,
urea is recommended in those summer or
[SPEAKER_00]: warmer months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium nitrate, when it's cooler out,
calcium nitrate can be used throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire season, same with blood meal and
albacuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: As just a last reminder, with nitrogen,
it happens quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Favor on the lower side because you can
always add more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to take away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at phosphorus deficiency here,
brown spots on fan and sugar leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking here, week three, progression of
foliar, phosphorus deficiency symptoms in
[SPEAKER_00]: the fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that progression here for week
four and then we have week five driven by
[SPEAKER_00]: C as well as D, which is right below me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In E, we see the whole plant phosphorus
deficiency symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugar leaves associated with the apical
inflorescence are shown in the insert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say, overall, I don't see a lot of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really scrutinize these images to see if
this is actually a phosphorus deficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: you have going on because, of course,
there's other pathogens or other issues
[SPEAKER_00]: that could be occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really scrutinize these images and see if
that's really a good match for what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing in your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you deal with the phosphorus
deficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you correct that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a primary mobile nutrient in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's generally immobile in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to keep in mind our soil versus
our plant comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphates versus phosphites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphates are essential for plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphites are not essential nutrients
used more as a fungicide to induce the
[SPEAKER_00]: systemic acquired resistance or SAR in
plants and not a fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a common deficiency seen in plants,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most growers over-fertilize with
phosphorus, to be honest, especially when
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets to the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have other videos showing you don't need
as much phosphorus as many growers
[SPEAKER_00]: typically are adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reasons for not over-fertilizing are to
keep other nutrients in balance and to
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize your yields to save money and
limit potential groundwater contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing the progression of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that in the sugar leaves at week
four and the fan leaves at week four and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we see the middle part of the canopy
really showing the most severe portions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, typically it is located a little bit
more on the margins of the leaves or the
[SPEAKER_00]: edges of the leaves and located a bit more
on the ends of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit more on the end portions and
then the margins within those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good indications or areas to look if
you're suspecting a potassium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you correct a potassium deficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a primary mobile nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium sulfate would be recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use potassium chloride or murite
or potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have more potassium, 60% versus
only 50, but there are more salt
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is used more in outdoor applications
where there'd be more natural rain to
[SPEAKER_00]: flush through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just looking at large trucks trying
to carry a higher concentration of
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers recommend wood ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use it, but be careful because it
will raise your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use it sparingly because it will bring
your pH up dramatically there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it brings us to a calcium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So progression of calcium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting in the lower fan leaves here in
week three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we see a more severe progression,
progress I should say, here going from a
[SPEAKER_00]: normal to kind of more advanced symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at letter C, week five is general
leaf margin necrosis on lower fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got upper fan and sugar
leaves starting to show symptoms as well
[SPEAKER_00]: at week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right next to me over here,
week six, the majority of fan leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar leaves showed that characteristic
leaf margin necrosis and upper leaves are
[SPEAKER_00]: curled upwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, key distinct factors here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't just jump to one, look at them
all and really see what signs you're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing in your leaves and what do they
actually match up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully you're catching it in the
earlier phases rather than later ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do you correct a calcium
deficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a secondary immobile nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you add lime, there is calcium in that
product, but not as much of that as plant
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Calamag from Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Biomincal, I've used them both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have tissue tests that show Calamag Plus
from Botanicare does raise levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So follow manufacturer recommendations and
keep that feed going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully you'll see a slowdown and
then prevention of that deficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms from there progressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnesium deficiency is represented by
intervental chlorosis or yellowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see week four is when it's first
starting to appear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might be a little hard to see,
but it's first starting to appear here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's through intervental chlorotic
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chlorosis is moving towards the
necrotic areas in between the leaflet,
[SPEAKER_00]: midrib and the margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see that where the veins stay
really dark green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's those in between areas where you're
first seeing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see more advanced week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the smaller fan leaves started to
show symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then week six, the magnesium
deficiency was widespread across the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire plant, except for some older and
larger fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be a little spotty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you correct a magnesium deficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a secondary mobile nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calamag has some magnesium in it,
but Epsom salts has a higher concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: of magnesium if you're really targeting
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One tablespoon per gallon for early onset
and foliar applications would be
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended for Epsom salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: A substrate drench and a foliar
application would be recommended to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure that that magnesium is going to
meet both ways and reduce the duration
[SPEAKER_00]: that your plant remains magnesium
deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two tablespoons per gallon or two
tablespoons per 3.7 liters for a quick
[SPEAKER_00]: progressing issue and something you want
to kind of really suppress as quickly as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This substrate is a drench rate because if
you apply that to the leaves, you risk the
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of them damaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a high concentration rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only recommended in most severe
cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are, but it has been used and there
is a chance of burn, but don't go any
[SPEAKER_00]: higher than that would be my
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now manganese is different than magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically lacking a flower size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know as soon as I say that,
most growers are going to think,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I have a manganese deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the manganese deficient versus
the control for that comparison at week
[SPEAKER_00]: seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the treatment or the manganese
deficient and that's the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see it is a slight decrease in
size and only really with a good
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison can you really tell the
difference between those two images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do you go about correcting a
manganese deficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use manganese sulfate,
often branded as
[SPEAKER_00]: manganese manganese manganese manganese
correct manganese and also a good general
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer just for general feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leading us to a sulfur deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is yellowing of the sugar leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this first appears as yellowing in the
younger sugar leaves and then progresses
[SPEAKER_00]: upwards and angled upward and canopy fan
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can kind of see that here where they're
starting to kind of go from this to a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more of that upward angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The following week symptoms did not
progress in the sugar leaves, rather they
[SPEAKER_00]: progressed in the fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can see that kind of here as
interveinal chlorosis, not to be confused
[SPEAKER_00]: with a magnesium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most severe and lower canopy fan
leaves here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind and look at the
distinctive yellowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very bright yellow coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind, but it will be first
seen in those upper sugar leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So timing is important in catching these
early as any grower should be scouting
[SPEAKER_00]: their plants on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do you go about correcting a
sulfur deficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, it's a secondary immobile
nutrient adding elemental sulfur or
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfuric acid or battery acid will add
sulfur, but also drive your pH down
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are not recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium sulfate, if you need potassium,
it also contains some sulfur with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also add gypsum, which will not
alter your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also other sources of sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might want to look at those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some also give you the benefits of other
nutrients such as calcium or nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take those into consideration and
hopefully you're identifying this
[SPEAKER_00]: potential issue early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So progression to various symptoms here of
iron deficiency on the upper and lower
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy tissue throughout the trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mild chlorosis on recently developed
sugar leaves we can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week five, we start to see modeling and
chlorosis in the central areas of those
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar leaves located right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see this disappeared in later weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So catching it early and then seeing it
shift was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Week six, though, the edge necrosis of the
lower fan leaves was evident.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is key for an iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do you go about correcting an
iron deficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a micro immobile nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't eat much of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, it's a micro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant available forms are important as
adding iron nails or iron filings will
[SPEAKER_00]: increase iron, but not necessarily plant
available forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where those chelate forms can be
important for this nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can see that on the label,
that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bioamine iron is another plant available
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It uses an amino acid to help get that
plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use various iron sulfate,
but in this case, remember, this is highly
[SPEAKER_00]: acidified.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pH of two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers need to make corrections to
ensure that that ferrous sulfate solution
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually plant available and not doing
more harm than good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, on my last slide here, I just want to
provide you with general deficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of refer to this and see
sulfur and calcium and nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium and phosphorus to best match up
potentially what you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, keep in mind, those calcium and those
phosphorus can look very close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to see more calcium deficiencies
than phosphorus, but utilize this guide
[SPEAKER_00]: here to visually diagnose your plants as
well to hopefully provide you suggestions
[SPEAKER_00]: for fertilization to reduce the symptoms
and to prevent it in the future.
Thank you.
