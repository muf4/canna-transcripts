[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the all-important flower room
in cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, of course, a zoomed-in of the
flower here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, you'd want an entire room full of
these flowers to produce high amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the flower room is typically called the
money room, or is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often referred to as the money-making
room, like little bars of gold for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, even though its productivity
depends heavily on the treatment and care
[SPEAKER_00]: during the time the plants spend in the
vegetative room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while this is considered the money
room, because it's considered the little
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers here and little bars of gold,
but really it's treating those plants well
[SPEAKER_00]: in the vegetative room to prepare them for
this flowering room is a very critical
[SPEAKER_00]: part of this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lighting for a flower room,
high-pressure sodium lights or
[SPEAKER_00]: full-spectrum LEDs are recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: These high-pressure sodiums kind of give
that kind of yellowish look, and
[SPEAKER_00]: full-spectrum LEDs will produce a very
bright and clean white light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be the largest room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're looking at vegetative rooms and
cloning rooms, this should be the largest,
[SPEAKER_00]: because plants are going to be full-sized
in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could transplant the plants as they go
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants can be transplanted into larger
containers, which should be the largest
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to use, since plants will
reach full size in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people, as they go from vegetative
to flower room, may decide to up-pot their
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's important not to shock your
plants during this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're transplanting at the same
time you're moving the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to allow a few days for
adjustment before changing the photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period to 12 hours of light and 12 hours
of darkness to help reduce plant stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be mindful of the amount of changes,
such as the container, the photo period,
[SPEAKER_00]: the room locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be slightly different in
environmental conditions, just indicative
[SPEAKER_00]: of the rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stresses you put on your plant at one
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What many growers will do is they'll first
up-pot the plants and move them to larger
[SPEAKER_00]: containers, then move the plants and wait
a few days before flipping the photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period to induce flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will allow those plants a little bit
of time to adjust and not create much of a
[SPEAKER_00]: shock or stress on those plants to help
allow them to maintain very high yields
[SPEAKER_00]: despite going through a couple changes
here without causing any loss or damage to
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants that's grower-induced.
Thank you.
