[SPEAKER_00]: So in this Tobacco University video,
we're going to be looking at how to select
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant material for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it comes down to is, do you start
with seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you start with clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: How you go about making that selection?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, as I said, there's two main
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start with seeds, where you have
that, you know, buy a little seed pack,
[SPEAKER_00]: that known variety you're going through
and starting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could start with clones and both
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one would you choose?
[SPEAKER_00]: And both have kind of pros and cons
associated with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting first with the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're selecting seeds to kind of
start with, these can have greater genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: variability, so it's important to keep
that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the more likely case where to
get male pollen or a pollinating plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feminized seeds would not be recommended
in this case, simply because it can limit
[SPEAKER_00]: your genetic variability if you're looking
at breeding purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When selecting a strain with a limited
variability, it's important so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a better idea of the genetics you'll
be working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important where if you start
with feminized seeds, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: really hard to kind of get any pollen or
male plants to then go through and
[SPEAKER_00]: continue with the production of your own
seeds there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just an important consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feminized seeds have a lot of benefits,
not so much or limiting more when you talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other option here we can consider
is clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a preferred option for a
female plant, but can also be a viable
[SPEAKER_00]: option for male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because it's a male plant doesn't
mean you can't clone it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those can be cloned in the same process
and procedures as you would a female
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes unique characteristics growers
are looking for are first noticed in a
[SPEAKER_00]: female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they typically are the first
ones kind of that are taken as clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Males are typically not grown on such a
large scale and can sometimes be more
[SPEAKER_00]: limiting there in a grower operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's interesting here is we're
looking at a female plant that produces
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this can limit your genetic
variability, in some cases this may be
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful for growers looking to generate
known genetics pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you find a really unique female kind of
ways you can go about reverting that so
[SPEAKER_00]: that female plant can actually produce
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is this going to basically create a
feminized seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the true long-term breeding
possibilities are limited for there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, seeds create a little bit more
genetic variability, clones a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more of that kind of exact replicate or
copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're only cloning female plants,
you may have to look into other methods or
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas to generate a male plant to get
pollen to continue that breeding process.
