[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at plant production and
what it takes to initially get plants
[SPEAKER_00]: started so that ideally they can grow well
during the season and you can get a
[SPEAKER_00]: bountiful harvest off them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a nice collection of fruits and
vegetables here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to speak in generalities,
but a lot of these things can apply and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can take them as reference points for
whatever specific crop you're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the main summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal is to turn this into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need some way to take our fruits of our
labor, literally speaking, and generate
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of profit to not only support
the farm, but our activities may be off
[SPEAKER_00]: season and to allow us to have financial
income to grow the following year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it all starts with a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not always, because there's grafted
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get to decide what you plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now certain market demands may require you
to grow certain types of crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: but specific varieties is where you come
in and you can make that decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grafted plants are worth considering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see some examples of some grafted
tomatoes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a disease resistant root stock,
meaning the bottom portion here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots in the soil can be resistant to
certain soil borne diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a better tasting portion on
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because oftentimes the top portion that
might be better tasting may not have the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease resistance that we want,
versus the plants that are disease
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant may not have the taste we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grafting, we kind of get the best of
both worlds, literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall to grafted plants is they do
cost more, but in the end it might be
[SPEAKER_00]: worth that cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember if you do grow grafted plants to
leave this graft union above the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: line, particularly with tomatoes,
if you bury this graft union below the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil line, roots will form from the top
section and you'll lose the ability of the
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage, I should say, of having that
graft union.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's to select?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many seed catalogs,
so many seeds, so many different
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you kind of go about developing a
selection for what you're actually going
[SPEAKER_00]: to plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what to look for is just some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The descriptions will always provide you
the best qualities, so keep that in mind
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're reading the seed catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every seed sounds like you can do no wrong
because you're supplying with the best
[SPEAKER_00]: qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant behavior is important to make sure
it'll fit your growing situation for
[SPEAKER_00]: planting purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be careful on some varieties,
whether it's a bush or a vine,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can impact your row spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That same one's better than the other,
but just be aware if you're buying a bush
[SPEAKER_00]: variety, they tend to be more compact and
a vine variety tends to spread out more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetable seed selection tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be looking for certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disease resistance, if we can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your market interest, because if you grow
it and you can't sell it, there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavor, this can be subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then plant behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a tall plant, a vining plant,
a spreading plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason we have the picture of the
horses here, we want to take kind of all
[SPEAKER_00]: the horses and select what we think is
going to be the winner for our situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not always be the winner all the
time in every grower's situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for your specific conditions,
you want to pick what you think is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to best fit in with all of your other
constraints you may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disease resistance is a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very important feature to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to actually save the crop with
no needed inputs from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a typical key, and each
manufacturer may have a slightly different
[SPEAKER_00]: key, but this is some very common ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example one farmer went out to
visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see the tomatoes here,
the plants at least, look pretty well
[SPEAKER_00]: shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants here immediately where the
stake is from this row down look very
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a tomato variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was a mountain merit when it
first came out and late blight came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see how devastating this was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a grower that didn't have to spray
anything by choosing just a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: variety that was resistant to the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to get a much healthier plant
versus the ones that were not resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned the terms resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Missy resistance, some manufacturers may
call tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not interchangeable terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tolerant means that the plant may get the
disease, but typically will survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resistant translates to, in most cases,
it will not contract the disease at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have the option of a tolerant plant
or a resistant plant, choose the resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: plant because it's more likely to survive
than a tolerant plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open up a seed catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can answer this, don't try them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 8 million different varieties,
it seems like, and you're trying to select
[SPEAKER_00]: one, two, three, four, not 1,000,
not 100, not grow a bunch and see what
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to be selective on the varieties that
you do give a try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Realize that each year is different,
so before you commit to just one variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: try it for multiple varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Develop an idea of your standard variety
for comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it better than what you grew last year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a variety that you really like
that can offer your comparison?
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I use, for example, better boy
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of my comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it compare to the better boy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it taller?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it more disease resistant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it produce quicker yields,
more uniform yields, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my example of my tomato variety
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to try something new,
I always point it next to a better boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my example of a better boy variety,
and see how it performs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in contact with seeds versus
transplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, pros and cons to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeding is very easy, can avoid root
disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cons is the fear of the unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put a bunch of seeds in the ground
and crows come through behind you and pick
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds out of the field, yes,
that's happened to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking a week later and you're
wondering why there's nothing germinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transplanting, the advantage is you have
an instant field to go right through,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what was empty in the morning can be
fully complete with plants by the
[SPEAKER_00]: afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It avoids potential animal damage because
you've got the transplants, not the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: going right in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: The con to this, though, is there's more
time caring for the seedlings than there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a hardening off process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're seeding, you don't have to go
through and get the big seeder here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of a large scale corn
seeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hand the seeder field,
no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to do transplants,
you want to have an adequate germination
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure it's warm,
well lit, good air circulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and easy access.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're done in the basement,
that's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just a bunch of tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being grown for a winter, warm is a
relative term.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be super hot,
just warm, well lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a bunch of different lights here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good air circulation is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it in a closed environment,
and easy access in and out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start with good seed starting
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potting soil should be selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed starting mix has finer versus regular
just potting soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better for seed to soil contact to
get the moisture content there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want seed starting mix, not
necessarily potting soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little finer, and it's especially
good for those smaller seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trays are often used.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to select the appropriate size to
maximize the area, but not restrict the
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling growth too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to label them all so you don't get
confused or move one for some reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then realize, oh, I don't remember
what variety that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here also labels in different pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, every tray is labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time is money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Standardize your trays and add a dibbler
to help speed up the production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there's little hand dibblers you can
use, but this is just some dowels on a
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: You flip this over, immediately puts a
hole the right depth to all the trays at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You drop all your little seeds in,
and you go on to the next tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that speed, efficiency,
and standardizing your trays, that
[SPEAKER_00]: planning process is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps you in the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once a seed emerges, they will need the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, grow lights have the proper spectrum
compared to regular house lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many options when you're looking
at lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the plants absorb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see not a lot of green.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chlorophyll is strong in the kind of
the bluish spectrum, and also the red
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different Kelvin temperature charts,
you can get different types of lights will
[SPEAKER_00]: produce different color temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many options.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go through a few of them and
compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some just have an idea, but LED,
metal halides, high-pressure sodiums,
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescent, and natural light are the
common options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comparing LEDs, which look like these
purple kind of lights, compared to metal
[SPEAKER_00]: halides or high-pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens to be high-pressure sodium
produces kind of that more orange color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metal halides produce a whiter light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advantage to the LEDs though, low power
consumption, efficient spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually dial in spectrums here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cons are they are quite expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't cover a whole lot of area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metal halide and HPS, high-pressure
sodiums, are easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, one bulb will cover a five by
five area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cons are power consumption though.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do consume quite a bit of power,
and they generate a lot of heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: so those should be taken into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluorescence versus natural fluorescence,
relatively low power consumption can fit
[SPEAKER_00]: easily over seed trays, but they need to
be kept really close to the seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to put them on a hanging chain so
you can raise them as the plants grow
[SPEAKER_00]: upwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not good for long-term growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really produce a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Naturals-free can be used hardening off
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great, but when you're starting your
seeds and germinating them, it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: short day lengths, and that can cause
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also all cause temperature spikes,
really get hot during the day and cool off
[SPEAKER_00]: at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just something to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the growers I see do use the
fluorescence, so just use that as
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardening off that I mentioned,
especially if you're using fluorescence,
[SPEAKER_00]: are kind of a weak intensity in light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure the plants are
coming from protected to a consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: environment that they're ready for the
extremes of outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light, temperature of the outside world,
wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can seem like a desert, even though you
might be watering them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep them inside, that's where the
air circulation is important, keeping a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeze on them, hardening them off,
getting them exposed to natural sunlight
[SPEAKER_00]: before just putting them outside in the
basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transplanting in early production,
you want to consider temperature swings,
[SPEAKER_00]: water stress, humidity, and
temperature-related animals, such as crows
[SPEAKER_00]: and mice, attacking the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could go through if you're really
laboring intensive, make little huts to
[SPEAKER_00]: put over the new transplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a grower here that has wheat
block down, walking boards that don't come
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the soil, and they set up these
little plastic kind of walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: This prevents wind damage, especially in
these large leaves, wind damage from
[SPEAKER_00]: current current and knocking the plant
over, causing damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top is left open, so there's not a
temperature consideration or reason for
[SPEAKER_00]: concern, but the sides are protected and
help harden them off in the way of wind
[SPEAKER_00]: damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: How tall is it going to get depends on the
variety that you select, so consider this
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're seed selecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need hoops for early-season
protection?
[SPEAKER_00]: They can support shade cloth as a way to
harden off some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may take a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can also hold insect netting,
so you may want to just go outside and
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately cover them for insect netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially important for cucumber beetles,
for squash plants, especially on later
[SPEAKER_00]: plantings, squash bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could even protect them from aphids if
you have small enough mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just, again, things to consider when
you're going to be transplanting outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: In season care, trellis and reweaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see these stakes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have materials is a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tomatoes need staking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we go buy some stakes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, odds are a lot of other people have
that same idea, and you may not be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the stakes you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What method are you going to select for
weeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have another video on weeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to use just regular organic
kind of hay mulch here, or are you going
[SPEAKER_00]: to use plastic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: For tomatoes in particular, how are you
going to do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: A single liter, double liter?
[SPEAKER_00]: No pruning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavy pruning?
[SPEAKER_00]: It all depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often and at what stage are you going
to harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pick tomatoes at what's called the
breaker stage with the little pink on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom, or wait for them to get fully red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, all decisions you need to make and
develop a plan for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Net harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to consider when you're
harvesting field heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You typically want to harvest in the early
morning or late evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Midday can cause them to dry out pretty
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: They contain a lot of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat from the sun, particularly in the
summer, and it's going to reduce storage
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you want to be harvesting?
[SPEAKER_00]: At what stage do you want to harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you're doing a farmers market,
a wholesale, a CSA, community supported
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, or something else,
restaurants, all can influence this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, things you want to have in your
plan for consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example, summer squash will carry out
continual harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can do those almost every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomatoes can be harvested before fully
ripe at what we call the breaker stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start to get a little pink at the
bottom here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing berry crops, again,
they can be very labor intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to pick them out when they're
kind of basically fully ripe, but have an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea what's ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have an idea what you'll have
for a harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: In post-harvest, storage of the crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You harvest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it going to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: And after you're done with the crop,
field cleanup.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can often be left to the very end of
the season, but certain crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're done with them, you want to find
a way to basically remove them or kill
[SPEAKER_00]: them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can harbor disease or other insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool bots or some type of refrigeration
system is a great thing to be putting into
[SPEAKER_00]: your plan and considering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can cool and remove that field
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large stackable storage bins that have
good air circulation, also important and
[SPEAKER_00]: worth consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this comes back to that
planning, that time investment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and having an idea of what's going to
occur over the entire season.
