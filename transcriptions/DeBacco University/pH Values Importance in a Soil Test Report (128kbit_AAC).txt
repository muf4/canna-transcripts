[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to go over why looking at your
[SPEAKER_00]: pH values that you get back with your soil
test report is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at pH values'
importance in a soil test report.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, pH is the most important,
and I know it's always hard to put
[SPEAKER_00]: something as the most important,
but when in doubt, I would say looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: your pH is definitely very high if not the
most important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it impacts many plant and nutrient
aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the pH is way off from your target
levels, the rest is much less important
[SPEAKER_00]: because when the pH is adjusted,
this can impact the availability of other
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, a soil test estimates the plant
available nutrients, not the total
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a kind of a little
graphical representation that if we just
[SPEAKER_00]: look at nitrogen here as an example,
pH around seven, pretty much that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and generally that 6.5 to kind of that
little over seven all in the green range
[SPEAKER_00]: are very available.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we get more acidic or more basic from
that, we can see that the availability of
[SPEAKER_00]: that particular nutrient will decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why pH is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If our pH comes back very low,
5.5, our phosphorus or potassium or sulfur
[SPEAKER_00]: might be less plant available and show up
as less on a soil test because remember,
[SPEAKER_00]: a soil test is estimating the plant
available nutrients, not the total
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is pH just in the general sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about this number that shows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a decimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that kind of relate to what's
going on in the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that number kind of represent?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what pH is, we might be familiar with
that pH scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a measure of the soil's acidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a range from one to 14 with seven
being neutral, representing pure water.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH values below seven, you can see here
and below, are considered to be acidic
[SPEAKER_00]: while those above are considered to be
alkaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH of the soil is not only affects the
availability of necessary plant nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also the solubility of potential toxic
elements such as aluminum and lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another reason why it's important
to know the pH value of your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we want to follow the lab
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see a soil report and they will
often offer lab recommendations as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of limestone or salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil lab you select will know not only
the pH of your sample, but also if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: offering recommendations, they will
calculate the buffer capacity,
[SPEAKER_00]: which a buffer is simply resistance to pH
change in relation to your soil type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utilizing all these factors will help
produce a good starting point for
[SPEAKER_00]: correcting your soil's pH if it does need
to be corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember though that the lab is only as
good as the sample you provide them,
[SPEAKER_00]: so make sure it is a representative sample
of the entire growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just a single site to ensure the pH
adjustment will maximize plant performance
[SPEAKER_00]: over the entire field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, follow the lab recommendations
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They offer a great starting point and you
could see over time how that field,
[SPEAKER_00]: how that soil may react.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you make a pH correction and it
will stay for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times you need to constantly retest
your soil and remaking adjustments because
[SPEAKER_00]: some for every reason shift from where
your target or ideal range would be.
