[SPEAKER_00]: Here we talk about HPS grow lights,
which stands for high-pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very easy to distinguish because
they tend to produce this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: yellowish-orange coloration to their light
spectrum, at least interpreted by the
[SPEAKER_00]: human eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: These high-pressure sodium lights,
much like metal halides, are most common
[SPEAKER_00]: in 600,000 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super bulbs, as it says with metal
halides, will be brighter than a standard
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're most commonly used during
flowering or fruiting phase, but can be
[SPEAKER_00]: used over the entire grow cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had plants go from germination in
little seedlings all the way to flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way to fruiting under
high-pressure sodium lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can generate more light than a metal
halide because of increased efficiencies
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have, but they can also increase
stem stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a possibility to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be careful and watch how much
power you're giving the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can help reduce the impact of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that nice yellow, kind of orangish
look is very common with HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce that yellow-orange color
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It favors the 2100 to 22K, which stands
for Calvin spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's just referring to the
coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very little of that has impacted the plant
or how we perceive it.
[SPEAKER_00]: High-pressure sodium bulb life is rated
about 5,000 hours, but again, most growers
[SPEAKER_00]: are chaining their bulbs out in a year or
less.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 5,000 hours in higher-quality lights
will still give you about 95% efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers will run it a little bit
longer, but be mindful of the yield that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking to get and the efficiencies
can be very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pros to high-pressure sodium lights,
we see two right here, just cooling down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very cost-efficient as prices have
dropped with other technologies entering
[SPEAKER_00]: the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another great option that they're
becoming cheaper per fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, the technology is very good,
but it's reached its peak and it may be
[SPEAKER_00]: replaced by LED lights going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bulbs need to be replaced at least a
yearly basis and reflectors typically
[SPEAKER_00]: every other year to maybe every three at
max every four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example of a high-pressure sodium light,
this is a Kavita Pro 1000 DE.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 1000 watt double-ended light
fixture here in Dallas, all inclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Kavita, their claim to fame is they
make lamps for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very much involved in the
horticultural lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ship everything all inclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically pull out the package and
plug it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: These also have a dimmer on them,
which is great if you're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: maximizing the versatility of using these
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They run cool and efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: These valves are cool to the touch even
when they're running.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be used for the veg phase of
production due to the broad spectrum that
[SPEAKER_00]: these lights produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just one example here of the
category under high-pressure sodium lights
[SPEAKER_00]: abbreviated HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for joining us.
