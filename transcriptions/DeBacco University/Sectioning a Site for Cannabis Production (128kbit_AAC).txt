[SPEAKER_00]: On this Tobacco University video,
we're going to go over sectioning a site
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis production and how we might
want to allocate different areas within a
[SPEAKER_00]: large field and how small or what
parameters would be used for making
[SPEAKER_00]: different ideas or sections within a large
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as we see the different sections of
pizza, let's go into sectioning a site for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, during the evaluation
process is when you should kind of have an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of where you might want to have
different sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when evaluating a potential growth
site, there may be differences noticed in
[SPEAKER_00]: one or many parts of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers should section out these into
subsections to provide specific analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: of these areas differently than the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now again, how small you make these or
what differences do you notice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well here we're seeing these dark green
patches.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing these much yellow margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in these brown areas as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it could be very difficult to
individually monitor each individual
[SPEAKER_00]: little area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at where the general
trends are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this area here for the most part
fairly consistent and we see areas over
[SPEAKER_00]: here a little less consistent as well as
over in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when in doubt, if there's two sections
in particular that you're going through
[SPEAKER_00]: and evaluating that appear to be
different, at the very least growers are
[SPEAKER_00]: advised to take separate soil samples for
each.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you identify any of these issues
within your field?
[SPEAKER_00]: As we see here, this kind of yellowing
banding that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes this can be explained by visual
differences and other times it confirms
[SPEAKER_00]: that the soil is the same and that there's
another reason for the differences
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're comparing two sections,
well it might be good to take a soil test
[SPEAKER_00]: from here and here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the results come back the same,
it might be a water issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be something else that's going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be different kind of soil vein
that runs through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's good to know especially when
you're evaluating a new site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the very least, what should growers
be doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: A grower section should be defined as
separate fields even if in very close
[SPEAKER_00]: proximity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If separate soil tests show similar
conditions, then a grower can know that to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat these two fields in a similar
manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here if we see these little driving
lanes here and we see these different
[SPEAKER_00]: blocks, it would be advised at least
initially to sample these differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if these come back the same,
well now we know in the future to manage
[SPEAKER_00]: those very similarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we're seeing an elevation change
and while they may look very similar,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's the potential for great
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that $20 soil test can really save a
lot of money in the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how small of an area should we section?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go through and how fine do we
detail something or how broad do we detail
[SPEAKER_00]: something?
[SPEAKER_00]: And really it comes down to the grower's
discretion.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when first evaluating an area,
these sections should be as small as
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the great scheme of things,
soil tests are cheap and in comparison you
[SPEAKER_00]: probably don't have to go through this
small little detail level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But taking a couple more soil tests and
getting them analyzed just to confirm
[SPEAKER_00]: something would be a great point of
advisement.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if they do come back the same,
it does not mean you have to keep sampling
[SPEAKER_00]: that many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's good initially to get that kind
of idea together, especially if it's a new
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how do we develop these subsections?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if the field is large, it can be
broken into subsections.
[SPEAKER_00]: The boundary of subsections is often based
on past practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, as we see here, compost in a
cover crop, versus compost only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though this might be the same field,
it would be good to soil sample these
[SPEAKER_00]: separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some fields also have multiple crops on
them that are rotated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can also be utilized as different
subsections to be sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The areas of rotation that have occurred
in the past may be within the same field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So subsectioning would be used to demark
these areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it gives the growers a little
bit more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as the grower, it's important to go
through the process of label and
[SPEAKER_00]: documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting a printout of the area is
important to get before you go into an
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help you orient yourself and
also mark where you're taking soil samples
[SPEAKER_00]: and what you're going to call each sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: When naming, try to select names that do
not change.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, north middle, if we're
talking in the northern area and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle section of that particular field.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're labeling something called a
cornfield, this is not a great name
[SPEAKER_00]: because it might be rotated and have
peppers grown the next year and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: might rotate back into hemp then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go into corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep in mind, you want to usually
stay away from crop names.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a farmer is currently using an area,
you may want to also make note of what
[SPEAKER_00]: they call the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have any questions, you can use
their terminology.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, you may name it north middle,
but if for whatever reason the farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: always calls it grandma's field by current
landowner, that might be what you might
[SPEAKER_00]: want to call it simply because that
current landowner might know, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: on grandma's field X, Y or Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can really just help you learn it in
the sense that you can utilize some more
[SPEAKER_00]: of that history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're calling it by a different
name, you might lose some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: background or history that the previous
landowner or someone you're leasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: land from might have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just some suggestions there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you find these helpful.
