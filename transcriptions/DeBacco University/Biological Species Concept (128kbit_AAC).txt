[SPEAKER_00]: Here we'll look at the biological species
concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we get a group of individuals
that's a subset of an original population,
[SPEAKER_00]: and why is that advantageous?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go over some of the reasons of why
this occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start, speciation is the process of
species forming process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It involves progressive change,
and localized populations become
[SPEAKER_00]: increasingly specialized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural selection acts to keep them
different enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of get this splitting effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, biological species concept is defined
as species are groups of actually or
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially interbreeding natural
populations, which are reproductively
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated from one another, other such
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of getting this separation
that occurs, and this can happen in two
[SPEAKER_00]: different forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a two-part process that causes
this initially to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, identical populations must diverge,
and two, reproductive isolation must
[SPEAKER_00]: evolve to maintain these differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speciation occurs quicker in the absence
of gene flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is much more likely in geographically
isolated populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have our formation of
low-fitness hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have selection against those hybrids,
and over time we get a clear and
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctive green and blue population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this hybrid, this intermediate,
was just not fit for the particular
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions, and our
speciation occurred causing a distinctive
[SPEAKER_00]: green and blue species to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two types here, and this
picture is a great way to visualize them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allopatric speciation, which is the
differentiation of geographically isolated
[SPEAKER_00]: populations into distinctive species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a population here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put that into a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a mountain region that's separated
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here, geographically isolated,
we have our darker colored green and then
[SPEAKER_00]: our lighter colored green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sympatric speciation is the
differentiation of populations within a
[SPEAKER_00]: common geographical area into distinct
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a reproductive isolation that's
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see in the middle region here presence
a greater number of lighter green trees
[SPEAKER_00]: than the darker greens on the outside,
and this is reproductive isolation that's
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So types of speciation, autopolyploidy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instantaneous, sympathetic speciation may
occur through polyploidy, which is more
[SPEAKER_00]: than two sets of chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Autopolyploidy, or all the chromosomes,
are from one species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This occurs when an individual has more
than two sets of chromosomes, which would
[SPEAKER_00]: be 4N, all derived from the original
species, which would be normal diploid,
[SPEAKER_00]: or 2N.
[SPEAKER_00]: To break the word apart, autopolyploidy
itself many fold or chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a failure in meiosis causes the
chromosomes to fail to separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting this kind of 4N,
or tetraploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this isn't always a good thing to
happen, but in certain instances,
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in particular, autopoly can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a type of speciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That zygote is tetraploidy, or basically
4N, instead of the original diploid,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would be 2N.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other type is allopolyploidy,
which is chromosomes derived from two
[SPEAKER_00]: species via hybridization.
[SPEAKER_00]: This in particular is much more common in
plants than animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this occurs when two different species
contribute to the polyploidy hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interpacific hybrids, hybrids created
from two different species, are usually
[SPEAKER_00]: sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the hybrids are usually very
vigorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does this apply?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, getting common polyploidies,
oats, cotton, potatoes, tobacco,
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat crops, typically fall into this
category, where we're looking at producing
[SPEAKER_00]: increased yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they're sterile, sometimes
these individuals may produce reduced or
[SPEAKER_00]: no seeds, which is advantageous for the
customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now there's the farmer getting larger
and more consistent crops, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring being produced might be more
favorable to the people buying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are just some examples of biological
speciation.
