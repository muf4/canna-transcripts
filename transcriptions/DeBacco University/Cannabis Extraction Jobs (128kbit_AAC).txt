[SPEAKER_00]: So in part, what makes cannabis such a
unique plant is here there's a job that
[SPEAKER_00]: has nothing to do with the actual
production of the plant, but is still very
[SPEAKER_00]: important, and that's the process of
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to learn more about what's
involved with cannabis extraction,
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to watch this DeBaco University
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into the all important
job of extraction when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis producing that final purified end
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off the general job description.
[SPEAKER_00]: The laboratory director is responsible for
engineering CPS's cannabinoid extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency and tracking programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Developing product sets and continually
creating efficient and repeatable methods
[SPEAKER_00]: for product production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to ensure that whatever we're doing
is able to produce, while it may look like
[SPEAKER_00]: a goopy substance in the end, is very
repeatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This laboratory director in the extraction
room, this also develops, implements,
[SPEAKER_00]: oversees the extraction, purification,
and formulation of cannabinoid-based
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all about how do they isolate one
particular compound, one particular
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule from YP of a great mixture of
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day-to-day activities of an extractor
is looking at ensuring laboratory meets
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate safety and security standards,
and some could be very simple,
[SPEAKER_00]: some could be very large operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to also direct the
extraction and purification laboratories
[SPEAKER_00]: within the company, and that will depend
on the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interact with suppliers for purchasing
equipment, components, soils, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also responsible for developing
new products to meet the demands of the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they communicate with third-party
testing laboratory for product release
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, product shelf life studies,
and new product characterization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot involved with those
isolation processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They supervise staff working in extraction
purification laboratories, as well as kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of looking through and developing those
protocols and refining those protocols on
[SPEAKER_00]: a day-to-day basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the qualities that a person must have
if you're looking at pursuing extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: is experiencing working with extraction
and purification of botanical products for
[SPEAKER_00]: human use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very special skill set involved with this,
so they want to have at least some
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A working knowledge of good manufacturing
practices, statistical processes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Six Sigma production
methodologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're working in such a stringent
area, want to be very controlled and
[SPEAKER_00]: directed with your day-to-day processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proficient and quality management systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a working knowledge of human drug
production regulations, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: industry standards to know what to
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advanced science degree, 10 plus years of
experience in the cannabis pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is involved or required in some
facilities, particularly those higher end
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very detailed process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can learn it throughout some of the
processes at some of the smaller areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we get into the larger scale
production, there's very small room for
[SPEAKER_00]: any potential error there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, connection to the cannabis industry
in general is that the cannabis extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: jobs are a necessary step in the future of
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: New extraction methods are continuously
being tested to increase efficiency of
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many consumers prefer extracts over flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we push forward into the future,
the extract industry will only get larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some are still about the dry flour,
but a lot of people getting into the oils,
[SPEAKER_00]: the crumbles, shatters, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, there's going to be a
greater demand for jobs with an extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being sure you're dialed in to produce
a high quality final extract is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: become very sought after, even more so
than is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
