[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this tobacco university video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be looking at the question,
what makes a drug illegal?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's a whole host of drugs
here, all itemized over here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: right-hand side, just to kind of give you
an idea of an example of about 16
[SPEAKER_00]: different drugs and what they look like
associated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first we need to define what a drug
is, and this is a drug in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a drug by definition is any chemical
that affects the human body or mind when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's consumed in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: A psychoactive drug affects the brain and
most of the laws are against the
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive drugs because of the
alteration to mood and behavior or simply
[SPEAKER_00]: brain function.
[SPEAKER_00]: The illegal drugs in particular,
they are drugs in which a person is not
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to own or use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The law says a person cannot own a
controlled drug without permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what classifies or defines an
illegal drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting into prescription drugs compared
to over-the-counter drugs, so we hear
[SPEAKER_00]: these terms used quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we define each of these
particular terms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a prescription drugs are
pharmaceutical drugs that requires a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical prescription to be legally
dispensed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're kind of, they have the control
step in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over-the-counter drugs can be obtained
without a prescription and the goal is to
[SPEAKER_00]: control potential for misuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why there's prescription and then
called over-the-counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind though, different
jurisdictions have different definitions
[SPEAKER_00]: of what constitutes a prescription drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: The United States code here, looking at
controlled substances, the website located
[SPEAKER_00]: right over here, provides a list in a
rating scale called schedules.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drug's potency, potential for abuse,
likelihood of physical dependency and
[SPEAKER_00]: medical implications are all factored into
the scheduling or the level of scheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this act establishes penalties for
offenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there'll be other videos that go into
this, but this gives you that general idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of kind of what that classification is for
legal and illegal drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
