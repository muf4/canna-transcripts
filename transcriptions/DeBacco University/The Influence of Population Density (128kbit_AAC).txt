[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to take a brief
overview of the influence of population
[SPEAKER_00]: density.
[SPEAKER_00]: The example image here, you can see a very
densely packed population or population of
[SPEAKER_00]: high density.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have two main ways to influence
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have density independent effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are effects that are independent of
the population size, but still regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these are aspects of the external
environment, such as weather related
[SPEAKER_00]: events, such as droughts, storms,
and floods, or also physical disruptions,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as fire and road construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to density independent
effects, we have something called density
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: These effects are dependent on the
population size and act to regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: These effects have an increase in effect
as the population size increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more people you have, the greater
influence these effects may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: A way to increase population would be
birth rates or immigration.
[SPEAKER_00]: A neutral change would be migration within
an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: A way to decrease population density
dependent factors would be through death
[SPEAKER_00]: rates and immigration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at a graph here,
this is a picture here, we see the line A,
[SPEAKER_00]: line B, and line C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one of these curves shows the effect
of density dependent factors?
[SPEAKER_00]: And which one of these curves shows
density independent factor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping in mind, our density independent
factors are externally, such as they could
[SPEAKER_00]: be examples of droughts, storms,
and floods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Density dependent could be birth rates or
death rates, immigration or emigration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the answers here, if you look at these
graphs here, you're welcome to pause the
[SPEAKER_00]: video and take a guess yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Answers would be density dependent would
be B here, because we are limiting our
[SPEAKER_00]: population growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And density independent factors could be
like storms and floods and droughts and
[SPEAKER_00]: floods, so you could see a lot more
variability that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since our population density member
carrying capacities, the maximum amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals in a particular environment
can hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we want to maximize population
productivity for harvesting organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this could be, for example,
fish in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of harvesting organisms for
commercial purposes is to maximize net
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This area here would be the maximum
sustainable yield, or optimum yield lies
[SPEAKER_00]: partially up the signal curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're looking at harvesting
individuals, this would be the maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: area we'd want to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will allow the population to kind of
bounce back and help regulate itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to harvest it all the way
down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want it to go all the way up to
the very maximum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of in the middle here as the
maximum sustainable yield of a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the area where we could be able to
harvest individuals in this case could be
[SPEAKER_00]: example for fish without hurting the total
population that naturally exists.
So this would be the maximum area we'd
want to harvest.
