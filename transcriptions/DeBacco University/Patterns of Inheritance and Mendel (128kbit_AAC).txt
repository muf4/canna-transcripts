[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're gonna look at patterns of
inheritance in Mendel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of a family tree or
pedigree, and we'll be looking at these a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit further.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of like a basic introduction
to heredity, which is gonna be our unit
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're gonna go over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with a family tree or pedigree
that you may not initially think of,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I grow giant pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see here, this is a family
tree or pedigree of one of the giant
[SPEAKER_00]: pumpkins that I grew back in 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: For nomenclature purposes, it's the
weight, and yes, that's 1,766 and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds, the last name of the grower,
and the year it was grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what precedes all of the
lineage here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could see my pumpkin here was grown
from this seed, and you see the weight and
[SPEAKER_00]: the last name of the grower in the year,
and that seed came from these pumpkins,
[SPEAKER_00]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with pumpkins, you need to plant a
seed in the ground, and you need a
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinator, so you need to develop a
pollen from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the lineage of the cross that I
made with the pollinating plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see it's one of my previous
grown pumpkins here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in nature, pumpkins, apples,
things that require bees, bees could fly
[SPEAKER_00]: to any flower and go through and
cross-pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: How we know this lineage is as giant
pumpkin growers, we're isolating the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a little zoomed in version of
another seed that I grew with a picture
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting in some way, in this case,
a cup over the flower to isolate the
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning no random bees came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would specifically take a flower,
a male flower, from a pollinator and
[SPEAKER_00]: directly pollinate the female flower here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how we're able to develop this
lineage in this family tree through
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled and isolated crosses as giant
pumpkin growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's how I chose giant pumpkins,
gives you a little bit of a visual here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a resulting pumpkin, and here's the
seed that that pumpkin came from,
[SPEAKER_00]: and here's the pollinator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see with pumpkins,
you kind of get a blending sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, this pumpkin took on the shape of
its mother a little bit more, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: color from the pollinator or its father.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of get this mixture of shape
from one, maybe color, a little bit from
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of an in-between pumpkin from
these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're talking about Gregor Mendel,
it's a good thing he didn't do pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was looking at pea plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a good thing, the reason why it's a
good thing he was looking at peas and not
[SPEAKER_00]: pumpkins is peas did not show these
blended traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They show the clear dominant recessive
trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no out-of-effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no grading, sliding scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either it expresses it or it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces purple flowers or white
flowers, not pink or light purple or kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of off-color to one or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mendel, in his Patterns of
Inheritance, the tendency for traits to be
[SPEAKER_00]: passed from parent to offspring is called
heredity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the main topic here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was an Austrian monk who was the first
person that really studied this and was
[SPEAKER_00]: considered to be the father of modern
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He worked with garden peas in his
monastery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, it's a good thing he
worked on pea plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he lived from 1822 to 1884.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he chose garden peas for several
reasons from his standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, there's many distinctive varieties
were available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're small and easy to grow,
can grow a lot in a small area,
[SPEAKER_00]: short generation time, and lots of
offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very important, we do scientific tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to occur quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to have a lot of sample size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both male and female reproductive organs
are enclosed within the same pea flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That also helps for pollination and the
able to go through and make these general
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many distinctive varieties being
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, this could be tall plants or
short plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be green pods or yellow pods,
white flowers or violet flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike a tomato, if you ever look at a
tomato catalog, there's extensive and
[SPEAKER_00]: extensive amounts of varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be hard to tell them apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, pretty distinctive varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's experimental designs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did it look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he selected seven characteristics to
study, and each had two distinguishable
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: He let each variety self-fertilize,
meaning pollinate with itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: take the pollen from the same flower and
pollinate itself with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he developed what's called a true
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What true breeding means is that you take
two parents here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're true breeding, you can cross
them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the same offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cross those together, you get the same
offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows consistencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breeds true from type.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, you have two purple flowers
always producing purple flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's called a true breeding
variety or pure bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: True breeding line indicated right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have these things called non-true
breeding, where the offspring may produce
[SPEAKER_00]: initially what looks like the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the C and the F2 generation,
I'll move myself over a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the F2 generation, right down here,
you're seeing that there's a white flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That white flower is because it's
heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up here, we have two heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a white and a purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here now, we have two purple flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are both homozygous dominant,
meaning they are going to be true
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see throughout the whole life
cycle over here that they're all true
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you look at part B,
now we're getting into some differences
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our F1 generation looks the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenotypically is the same, but
genotypically is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our F2 generation is where we're noticing
we have purple and also white flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: being produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: The F1 is that first generation,
and F2 is that second generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a result of there being a
heterozygous genotype here, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: the phenotype is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's experimental design across two
individuals from two different varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: that differ in only one trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a purple and a white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spread them together, got all purples,
and the F2 generation, again, produced 75%
[SPEAKER_00]: purple and 25% white.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw that in our previous crosses there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he observed?
[SPEAKER_00]: We observed all the seven pairs of
contrasting traits studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's called this thing called dominant and
recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain things would mask or hide other
traits, and those were the dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recessive traits would simply not be
expressed unless you had two alleles,
[SPEAKER_00]: two genes of that same recessive type.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to think of recessive
being negative because recessive traits
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't necessarily bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means they are not shown only if
they're homozygous recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dominant trait in a heterozygous will
mask or hide that recessive trait,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we see here with our green pods and our
yellow pods.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, if yellow is dominant,
the genes for green are there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but all of the pods will be yellow because
that's the dominant trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example what he observed is called
Punnett squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing two little bees, two big bees,
we're seeing heterozygous, all the brown
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we take two individuals from these
resulting offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We breed those together, and we see that
we get 75% brown eyes, 25% blue eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That three-to-one ratio is the dominant
recessive, is what we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just repeat it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be our male.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be our pistol from our female.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're noticing the resulting genotype and
also phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to keep those in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that in perspective here, our genotype
and phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genotype, there's 25% homozygous
dominant, big bee, big bee, 50%
[SPEAKER_00]: heterozygous, big bee, little bee,
and 25% homozygous recessive, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: gives us white.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a one-to-two-to-one ratio for
genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, our phenotype is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: 75% purple, 25% are white.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just looking at them
phenotypically, what they basically
[SPEAKER_00]: express.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a result of Mendel's experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looked at many, many, many individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a good thing that they were short
generation time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, our dominant recessive,
he did the ratios out over a large sample
[SPEAKER_00]: size, and he pretty much got very close to
that predicted three-to-one ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just helped prove the results that he
was observing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how our opponent squares are able
to take this and try to present it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: clean ratio form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it may not be 100% exact,
it's going to be very close observed even
[SPEAKER_00]: in large numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
