[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this video here on Tobacco
University looking at a fly life cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it may relate to forensic science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why we'd be interested in
insects, particularly in relation to
[SPEAKER_00]: forensics, is that they have a certain
succession or progression that they go
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the progression of insects life follows
a pattern on cadavers and development
[SPEAKER_00]: rates of flies are relatively predictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the length of the life cycle varies
between different fly species and is
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent on temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can help us kind of backtrack or
determine how long that corpse has been
[SPEAKER_00]: there or potentially the temperature based
on the insects that are present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically flies lay eggs usually within
the first 24 hours and then the predatory
[SPEAKER_00]: rove beetles or parasites that feed on
maggots will have to wait until the
[SPEAKER_00]: blowfly arrives and lay their eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to focus a little bit on
the blowfly in particular here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beetles that specialize on bone will have
to wait until the bone is exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on the insect species that we're
noticing or observing, that can help us
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of get a general idea of the time
frame, which will be very important when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at trying to determine when
the initial point of death occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now blowfly metamorphosis, so kind of
focus on this just for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blowflies are attracted to dead bodies
and often arrive within minutes of the
[SPEAKER_00]: death of an animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are distinctive egg, larval and
pupal adult stages which help estimate the
[SPEAKER_00]: time of death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where a good entomologist,
a good person to identify not only the
[SPEAKER_00]: insects, but the stage of development
they're in can help also provide a direct
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the stage one, looking at the eggs,
all adult flies lay eggs on the carcasses,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in the wound areas or around
openings in the body such as the nose,
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes and ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to kind of be that very first stage to
be looking for early on in the fly life
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Progressing on, then we have the larval
stage is where the eggs hatch into larva
[SPEAKER_00]: or typically referred to as maggots in the
first 12 to approximately 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing from there, the larvae continue
to grow and they'll molt, which means they
[SPEAKER_00]: shed their exoskeleton as they pass
through the various end star stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: An end star is a phase between two periods
of molting and the development of insect
[SPEAKER_00]: larvae or other invertible organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first end star, if you capture them
and preserve them, you're looking at,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can determine that being about five
millimeters long and that occurs after
[SPEAKER_00]: about 1.8 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second end star, they'll progress to
about 10 millimeters long and that will
[SPEAKER_00]: occur after about two and a half days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third end star will be about 14 to
16 millimeters long.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will occur after four to five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the pupa stage, at stage number four
here, the larvae are about 17 millimeters
[SPEAKER_00]: and they develop into pupa after burrowing
into surrounding soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where we're not only looking at
the corpse, but the soil around that can
[SPEAKER_00]: also play a very important factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adult stage that we're probably most
familiar with where the fly emerge from
[SPEAKER_00]: the pupa cases, and this occurs after
about six to eight days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, probably work most easily or
most common for recognizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at the blowfly in particular,
it has six parts, the egg, the three
[SPEAKER_00]: larval stages, the pupa, and the adult
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of gives you an idea of not
only the progression, but how long it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes to go from one area to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind this is at 70 degrees
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each stage in a blowfly's life cycle takes
this known amount of time to complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, temperature or documenting
that temperature, having an idea what that
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature may have been in the area can
impact the time exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So important to take note of that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this metamorphosis process that can
occur while in flies and beetles and many
[SPEAKER_00]: other insects have a complete
metamorphosis, which consists of four
[SPEAKER_00]: stages, the egg, larval, and pupal to
adult stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these both metamorphosis stages,
the insects begin a cycle as an egg and
[SPEAKER_00]: complete the metamorphosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the insect passes through four
distinct phases, which produce an adult
[SPEAKER_00]: that does not resemble necessarily the
larval stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important to keep note of.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why a good entomologist is needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it may look quite different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be these different transitions that
occur from that nymph to the adult by
[SPEAKER_00]: molting the exoskeleton whenever it
becomes too tight in its original casing
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lastly, just where you want to look for
these insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you're not an expert
entomologist, just kind of an idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: where to kind of look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the adults mate, the females usually
will lay eggs onto the corpses,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's usually near natural body
openings or wounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeding activity is usually seen in the
head region first, which is the mouth,
[SPEAKER_00]: nostril, eyes, or ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is followed by the excretory and
reproductive openings as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trunk of the body is invaded much
later in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can just give you a general idea
of when you're looking for those insects,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you may find them, just to give you
a general idea of the progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind of the type of insect you're
looking at, as well as the temperature in
[SPEAKER_00]: the area, because all that will have an
influence and be able to try to pinpoint
[SPEAKER_00]: with the greatest degree of accuracy the
original time of death.
