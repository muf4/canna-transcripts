[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in learning more
about outdoor cannabis production,
[SPEAKER_00]: come to the right place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to go over some of the key
aspects and considerations if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at growing your cannabis outdoors
here on Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into some of the
considerations for outdoor cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the outdoor environment in general can
be very challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many aspects that are out of your
control, so be sure to maximize the
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions that you do have control over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil evaluation and modifications are
important or controlled aspects with
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could be in a field situation or
it can be even in kind of like a soil in
[SPEAKER_00]: these fabric pot containers that are
growing in an outdoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure you have all the basics covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know what plant type you're
going to be growing, what nutrients you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be using, and how you're going to
properly irrigate the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now outdoor growing, scouting is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many unknown variables,
so be sure to take a look out for anything
[SPEAKER_00]: that is out of the ordinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can be looking at the soil,
this can be looking at after they're
[SPEAKER_00]: planted, scouting for insects,
scouting for potential for disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also looking at just the general area,
what weeds are growing in a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of trees, a lot of stumps,
so there's things to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocks, for example, all variables that
people want to take into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at growing your cannabis
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a simplified outdoor growing
checklist, and again it can be very
[SPEAKER_00]: variable, and there'll be a plethora of
videos here on this channel to help cover
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these main topics so you can learn
about it in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well you want to do a general site
evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to like look at a site and kind
of evaluate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the hills, look at the area,
look at the drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prepping the field once you decide on a
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you go about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant layout, how you're going to
organize your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Properly taking a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only properly taking the soil test,
but getting that soil test results in
[SPEAKER_00]: interpreting that soil test are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed management, because there are always
going to be weeds that are going to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then irrigation are all important
considerations when we're looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that site evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well identifying the field section,
allocating subsections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to soil sample areas
differently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to be planting one area
earlier than another?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a change in topography,
a change in soil type?
[SPEAKER_00]: All these need to be part of your site
evaluation for your cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it gets into field prep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potentially using a cover crop as we
see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know if you're able to get into the
site early, prepping that with having a
[SPEAKER_00]: good root structure here for cover crop,
preparing the biology, preparing the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: structure for your cannabis crop to come
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I said plant layout.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here what's going to be your
plant spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your plant density per thousand
square feet or per acre?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your row orientation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could deal with the kind of the
change in topography of the land,
[SPEAKER_00]: the angle of the sun, different tree
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to be your seeding rate?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's going to be your planting date?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to use seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to use clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: All important considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you're taking a soil test,
you want to make sure you're following the
[SPEAKER_00]: proper methods for a mineral test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're taking a June nitrate
test, slightly different methods for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure you're going
through and reading those protocols ahead
[SPEAKER_00]: of time and making sure you're properly
sampling the soil for the Indian test that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be sending that sample out
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you get that sample results back,
hopefully if you took a good sample,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll get some field representative or
grows off and say quote unquote accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at pH, organic matter,
salt, particle size, potentially for
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium
micronutrients in CEC, cation exchange
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll come back in a soil test that
might look something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you go about interpreting the
soil test and what adjustments you make
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be important to ensure that
your cannabis plants have a good start and
[SPEAKER_00]: a good environment to support their
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you have good cannabis plants
and good growing cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds are also going to be a problem most
likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be sure you have in-row
weed management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see here with use of black
plastic, but also between row management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're maximizing the production of the
crop that we intend to grow and not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting bogged down in this example here
with some grass species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, we want to be considerate of
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to get water to our
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to use a drip irrigation
system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to use an overhead irrigation
system?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't always depend or rely on the
rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great ways to have some method so we can
supplement water if we need to,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly on a high value crop such as
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this didn't scare you away
from any outdoor productions in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: that there are a lot of things that
growers need to be aware of, even the
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just to get all the free energy from
the sun, these plant and walk away to
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize that harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things you need to take into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I welcome you to look at other videos
here on Tobacco University so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: educate yourself on all these different
aspects to hopefully have you avoid some
[SPEAKER_00]: initial mistakes and maximize your
production.
