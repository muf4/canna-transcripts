[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go over the natural
cannabis seed breeding process here,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of walk you through some of the basic
steps if you're not familiar with seed
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding in general, just to kind of give
you a general healing on how it naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs here on Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the video here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, to have a proper breeding
process, you need to have male and female
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing both male and female plants at
the same time can allow for the production
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, female plants are going
to look like the ones down over in this
[SPEAKER_00]: area, and the male plants are going to
look like the kind of flowers there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to be able to identify a
male and a female plant as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep them generally isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to be careful with the male
plants, particularly for growing for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and terpenes, because they
can pollinate plants we may not want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated, vastly reducing our
cannabinoids and terpenes produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So focusing first on those male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, male plants typically mature before
female plants to help ensure that pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: will be ready as the female matures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen is wind transferred, so often there
can be a lot of pollen produced,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's very fine pollen at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For indoor operations, the pollen can get
into ventilation systems, so be mindful of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for outdoor locations, the pollen can
travel from one field to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to keep that in mind whether
you're an indoor or outdoor grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you are producing male plants or a
neighbor's producing male plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: be aware of the distance that pollen can
travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for female plants, pollinating them
will cause a shift in the plant's energy
[SPEAKER_00]: from cannabinoids to seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, that shift that will
reduce that production of the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: and terpenes that we may be seeking or may
have grown that plant for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get everything, you can't get
seeds and high cannabinoids, you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: one or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this comes down a lot in breeding,
it comes down to timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ensuring both the male and female
plants need to be at the same stage of
[SPEAKER_00]: development to increase the odds of a
successful pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: For indoor applications, this can be
potentially achieved by a photo period
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustment, and for outdoor grows,
this can be just a timing when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeding those plants and when the natural
photo period will change as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: To ensure you have a plant of large enough
structure to be able to support and
[SPEAKER_00]: produce high quality and high quantity and
quality seeds, keep in mind also that when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at seeds, there are often
different strains that we bred together to
[SPEAKER_00]: create a hybrid with the intention to get
the best of both original plants in one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This result in offsprings that will have
increased variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this may be different traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, desired plant morphology and
preferred chemical profile could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: great combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auto-flowering a preferred chemical
profile is another thing that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: growers are trying to breed for.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the sense that they're selecting
certain pollen, isolating certain females,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing certain strains to kind of get
this best of both worlds into one plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can call their own ideally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember that the theoretical does not
always equal the observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you make a cross and are
expecting something and theoretically that
[SPEAKER_00]: should happen, it doesn't always mean
that's what it's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you get what you want,
other times it just simply doesn't work
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a tall plant with a great
chemical profile, and a plant that's short
[SPEAKER_00]: with poor chemical profile and you cross
the two, you might get a short plant with
[SPEAKER_00]: great chemical profile, which would be
excellent for indoor growing operations,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind you could also get a tall
plant with poor chemical profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: which isn't gonna make anyone happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key is growing as many plants and then
selecting the ones with the desired traits
[SPEAKER_00]: that you as a grower deem desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that gives you a quick little
overview here of how to breed cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: natural cannabis breeding in general.
