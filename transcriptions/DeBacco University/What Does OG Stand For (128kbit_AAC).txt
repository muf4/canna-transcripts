[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over what does
OG stand for, and particularly what does
[SPEAKER_00]: OG stand for in relation to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the picture of Stonehenge here,
simply because it's kind of one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things that for OG and the cannabis world,
everyone recognizes that it's there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but may argue or debate the actual
original or the reason why it's simply put
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also there's some varying opinions on
what it actually does stand for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried to provide some information on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, OG usually stands for,
some people think it's ocean grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: other people, original gangster.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a highly debated topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, most indications refer to the
fact that the OG name started in Southern
[SPEAKER_00]: California in close proximity to the
ocean, but is also where the Crips street
[SPEAKER_00]: gang started.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Kush is the main cultivar to focus on
because it's often said, he who has the
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush wins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the OG Kush is probably one of the more
familiar OG names out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's supporting arguments for both
ocean grown and original gangster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So OG for ocean grown, what are the
supporting arguments for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the Kush came from the Hindu Kush
mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it got its, that's where the
Kush name came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was brought to the West coast,
the ocean climate, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: California, Southern California also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a very different climate than
the Hindu Kush mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this resulted in the change in
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This leads to the term OG Kush to indicate
where it was grown since Kush grown near
[SPEAKER_00]: the ocean would have different effects in
Kush grown in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the presence of the name OG,
the absence would be identifier,
[SPEAKER_00]: letting people know what effects to
expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would indicate also where it was
grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the OG for original gangster support.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's also in this area in Los
Angeles, Southern California, the term
[SPEAKER_00]: original gangster is quite popular due to
the Crips street gang that started around
[SPEAKER_00]: 1969.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Kush first became popular or
originated in the Los Angeles area where
[SPEAKER_00]: OG has strong ties with the established
street gang, which means original
[SPEAKER_00]: gangster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since growing the Kush started in Southern
California, it's natural that should be
[SPEAKER_00]: called the original due to the Kush's
potency and more than qualifies it as a
[SPEAKER_00]: gangster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's try to get this debate kind of
answered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it ocean grown or original gangster?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's likely when the cannabis cultivar
Kush was grown in Southern California,
[SPEAKER_00]: the flavor profile was changed from the
native mountain regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same would be applied to growing the
Kush cultivar in other places of the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like the new Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could think about it as like these
hard candies here is Jolly Ranchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're different flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all still Jolly Ranchers,
but they have different effects or
[SPEAKER_00]: different those flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is relating to different maybe
terpene profiles, despite being that same
[SPEAKER_00]: broad category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's most likely resulted in other
growers relating something special about
[SPEAKER_00]: being grown near the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, Southern California growers
were referring to their homegrown cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: as the original due to the history of the
area entitled original gangster is very
[SPEAKER_00]: logical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does OG stand for?
[SPEAKER_00]: So OG is most likely referred to
originally as ocean grown as a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: distinguish the flavor change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those in Southern California know that
this potent cultivar started in their
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're more apt to call original
gangster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this kind of mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, OG to the masses, I think,
is where the confusion comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, since OG has been transferred to
many other facets of life, in these
[SPEAKER_00]: situations, there's no connection to a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's only thought of to connect with
original gangster.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably the most accepted kind of
term there that refers to that original
[SPEAKER_00]: gangster, simply because it's being
applied to other situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is some clear evidence that OG
may stand for, at least in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: originally, as getting into that ocean
grown standpoint, even though now with its
[SPEAKER_00]: popularity, OG to the masses, most people
have a connection to original gangster
[SPEAKER_00]: being the definition of OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does OG stand for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look.
Let's take a look.
So what does OG stand for?
Let's take a look.
