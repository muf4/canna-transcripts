[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so while blood may have different
properties than water, I think this image
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of gives a good idea of what this is
all about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at cast-off bloodstain
pattern interpretation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it as you see the woman here
with her hair in the water, how that
[SPEAKER_00]: cast-off, how that may impact where the
blood is going to be found and what
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern it's going to leave when it
impacts a surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, wave cast-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tail of the elongate of stain points
in the direction of travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's important there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just looking at determination of
where did that blood travel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the direction of its travel?
[SPEAKER_00]: The tail of the wave cast-off points back
to the parental apparent drop,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are wave cast-offs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see kind of that angle and
impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it traveling to?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of pattern is that going to
leave?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see evident here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of gives that kind of
walkthrough of wave cast-off is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's going to ultimately
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to see kind of that was
the direction of travel there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the parent drop and the
wave cast-off here, again, pointing the
[SPEAKER_00]: direction of the travel of that blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be very important when looking at a
crime scene, you see it on a wall or a
[SPEAKER_00]: ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can really help you determine the
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at example, for example,
a downswing of a hammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here we have a hammer and we have a
downswing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming in contact with the person's head
here, again, causing a pooling of blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the hammer coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it comes back, we're noticing this
is where the cast-off of blood is
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first we have the first blow causing
the bleeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subsequent blows can contaminate the
weapon with blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blood is cast-off tangentially to the
arc of the upswing or backswing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pattern and intensity depend on the type
of weapon, the amount of blood on the
[SPEAKER_00]: weapon, and the length of the arc,
as we can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is a great example of
seeing how that is going to change,
[SPEAKER_00]: how that cast-off is going to be found on
the ceiling, how that's going to determine
[SPEAKER_00]: the point at which the impact occurred and
sadly where that victim was standing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ceiling view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we kind of look at it as a look from
a ceiling view, overhead swing of the
[SPEAKER_00]: blood metal bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking here at that single kind of
pretty much a inline pattern here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look really closely,
we had to tell, again, the direction of
[SPEAKER_00]: that blood.
