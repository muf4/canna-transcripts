[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'll be doing my best to provide you
an overview of the photosynthetic process
[SPEAKER_00]: we see pictured here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times it's abbreviated capital P
lowercase s if you see that that stands
[SPEAKER_00]: for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the basic overview is taking in plants
take in solar energy carbon dioxide and
[SPEAKER_00]: water to produce energy storing
carbohydrates in the form typically of
[SPEAKER_00]: sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxygen is generated as a byproduct and a
waste product for plants which is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: thing for us animals because we need that
to breathe to go through our cellular
[SPEAKER_00]: respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the water is absorbed through the
roots of the plant and is transpired
[SPEAKER_00]: through throughout the plant there to help
move water keep everything hydrated high
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger pressure and also move nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at photosynthesis on a macro
and micro scale not all cells within a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant carry out or have all the components
to carry out photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cells in the middle layer of the leaf have
the chloroplasts which contain the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic apparatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here the darker green region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look towards the top that's the cuticle
and that's a waxy protective layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dark green section here is where the
photosynthesis will be occurring at the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now within the photosynthesis it's very
complex sequence of steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: In short though it's conversion of light
energy into chemical energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes place in two stages we have
the light dependent reaction and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: have the Kelvin cycle or the light
independent reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light dependent reaction is takes
place in the thylakoid membrane uses light
[SPEAKER_00]: as an aim implies it's generating ATP and
then a DPH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those energy molecules are going to the
Kelvin cycle which takes place physically
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plant within the stroma and it uses
energy derived from these compounds to
[SPEAKER_00]: make GA3P ultimately will be made into
sugars from the carbon in carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the equation for photosynthesis which
you might be familiar with is carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide plus water and sunlight producing
sugars and oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it takes six carbon dioxide six water
molecules light energy to produce one
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar or glucose molecule and six oxygen
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of deceptively kind of simple
when you look at it this way but there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: very complex sequence of steps that derive
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This requires a lot of intermediate
reactants but this is the general summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glucose is the primary energy source in
cells and is made from two three carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: GA3Ps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now photosynthesis is a transfer of
electrons and this is what's termed a
[SPEAKER_00]: redox reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since electrons have a negative charge
when an electron is transferred there's
[SPEAKER_00]: also a change in charge gaining electrons
meaning you're being reduced losing
[SPEAKER_00]: electrons it's called oxidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you think about gaining a negative
charge your total charge is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: become negative it's going to be reduced
it's going to be less than what it was
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how it gets the tame redox
reaction reduction in oxidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're transferring the electrons
something is getting reduced and something
[SPEAKER_00]: is getting oxidized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So photosynthesis transfers electrons from
water to energy poor carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules forming energy rich sugar
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again when you're kind of gaining those
electrons that's part of the reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: charge and losing electrons is oxidizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this kind of simple way to
remember this oxidative reduction redox
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water is oxidized meaning it's losing
electrons and the carbon dioxide is
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced means it's gaining electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesis uses light energy to drive
these electrons from water to their more
[SPEAKER_00]: energetic states of the sugar byproducts
result of solar energy is converted to
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: How we remember this is called Leo's the
lion says gur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leo losing electrons is oxidation gaining
electrons is reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Leo says gur very commonly said easy to
remember to help you remember what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on with a redox reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here reductions are gaining
electrons the carbon dioxide going to the
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar and water ultimately going to the
oxygen is the oxidation that's losing
[SPEAKER_00]: electrons in that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This all takes place as I said in the
chloroplasts so I should probably show you
[SPEAKER_00]: what a chloroplast looks like in some of
the components.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where that photosynthetic process
is occurring and I mentioned also the
[SPEAKER_00]: stroma where the light independent
reaction with the Kelvin cycle occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all within this membrane here but
remember there's multiple membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these stacks of style code called grana
from a third membrane as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see outer and inner and a kind
of a third membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's allowing these compartments
to very precisely control where these
[SPEAKER_00]: reactions are occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now chloroplast from multiple views here
we can see that chloroplast consists of
[SPEAKER_00]: thylakoid membranes surrounded by the
stroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thylakoid membranes contain molecules
of the green pigment chlorophyll for the
[SPEAKER_00]: absorption of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in the cartoon image how they
look here kind of all stacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what they look like in an actual
image.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see those really dark kind of
banding regions are those basically those
[SPEAKER_00]: thylakoids there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The absorbed light most of the light is
lost as heat from the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of an interesting note that
those leaves are out there but those are
[SPEAKER_00]: receiving light which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need that to be able to convert those
sugars but they're also getting a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: heat energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cooling aspect with transpiration is
very important for plant survival and that
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration is kind of like the plant
sweating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think of it as that in that term
where those high energy molecules are
[SPEAKER_00]: being evaporated reducing the temperature
of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have photophosphorylation which is
generating ATP, denesine triphosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the energy used by the cells to
complete its necessary function.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the highest level, denesine
triphosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only having two phosphates, denesine
diphosphates because the next lowest the
[SPEAKER_00]: lowest energy form is AMP, denesine
monophosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The denesine triphosphate ATP is the
energy currency of the cell so it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to complete many necessary and
life-supporting functions.
