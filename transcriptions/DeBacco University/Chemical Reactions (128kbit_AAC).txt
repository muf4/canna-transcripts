[SPEAKER_00]: As you can tell from the length of this
video, this is a very brief overview of
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured I'd put a picture here of some
fireworks indicating a chemical reaction
[SPEAKER_00]: you've probably seen in a very familiar
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a chemical reaction is making and
breaking chemical bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The starting molecules of a chemical
reaction are called reactants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the final molecules of a chemical
reaction are called products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at our example here, the reactants
are methane and oxygen gas, producing our
[SPEAKER_00]: products, which is carbon dioxide gas in a
water vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make note of this reactants the products
has an arrow pointing in one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something related to biology, we have
photosynthesis, which is a very important
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, sunlight powers the conversion of
carbon dioxide in water to glucose and
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen, and we see our reactants on this
side with the arrow pointing one direction
[SPEAKER_00]: to our products, which is sugar and
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now something called chemical equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is reached when the forward and
reverse reaction rates are equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is indicated by this kind of half
arrow pointing to the right and half arrow
[SPEAKER_00]: pointing to the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is indicating an equilibrium is
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some chemical reactions go to completion,
where all reactants are converted into
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we saw in the previous slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, all chemical reactions are
reversible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The products of the forward reaction
become reactants of the reverse reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: In chemical equilibrium, the reaction
actually doesn't stop, it just reaches a
[SPEAKER_00]: point of balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here we're mixing two things in the
jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This chemical equilibrium, the rate of the
forward reaction is equal to the rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: the reverse reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is some sort of misprint,
where it's like, I don't even know what
[SPEAKER_00]: that is, weird symbol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting half an arrow pointing to the
right and half an arrow pointing to the
[SPEAKER_00]: left, indicating there's no net change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's visually changing, even though
reactions may be occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call this chemical equilibrium because
the forward reaction rate is equal to the
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse reaction rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's essentially no change,
no net change, even though we have an
[SPEAKER_00]: equal distribution both forward and
reverse reaction ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
