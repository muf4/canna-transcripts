[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this DeBaco University video
looking at drip irrigation specifics for
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the image shows here, here's some
cannabis plants growing and they're using
[SPEAKER_00]: a drip style irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about some of the specifics
associated with this type of system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the general basics of this
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, drip lines are basically used and
with tubing as we can see going right down
[SPEAKER_00]: the line right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its goal is to precisely deliver water to
the plants and precisely deliver water
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in a very even inconsistent manner
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is often done with low pressure and
regulators to ensure consistency even in a
[SPEAKER_00]: large operation as we see in the image
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timers are typically incorporated to allow
for automation as well as potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: water sensors to again help maintain
consistency amongst all the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the advantages of drip irrigation are
that there's water savings simply due to
[SPEAKER_00]: less waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also reduced fertilizer loss due
to the precision of delivery up to
[SPEAKER_00]: individual plants and also the ability to
automate to allow for consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy to maintain a drip
irrigation system and it also has a long
[SPEAKER_00]: life expectancy of its components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for all these reasons, this is why drip
irrigation is a system that's used by many
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are some challenges with
any system and drip irrigation is no
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's potential for salt accumulation
due to lack of waste or leaching water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be clogging within the system
as filters are not put in place or the
[SPEAKER_00]: filters themselves could clog if they're
not checked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaks can also often have many fittings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure you're checking the system for
those leaks and checking the system
[SPEAKER_00]: regularly should be done in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a need for specific parts and
extras to allow for quick replacements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some drip irrigation specific
components that need to be purchased and
[SPEAKER_00]: also purchased with a little extra in case
something was to break or fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The equipment required.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, we're looking at a drip
system, drip spikes, transfer tubing,
[SPEAKER_00]: main lines, fertilizer injector,
timers, valves, filters, pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators, and connecting fittings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at this list, it does look
like it's quite extensive, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things come together as a kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them are just long lasting
components that don't necessarily need
[SPEAKER_00]: continual replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now drip irrigation versus hand watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would someone choose one versus the
other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, both deliver specific amounts of
water to the plants individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hand watering requires daily labor to
accomplish this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drip irrigation can drastically reduce the
day-to-day time spent accomplishing this
[SPEAKER_00]: same task.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, since it can be automated,
the drip irrigation, it's easy for growers
[SPEAKER_00]: to decide to go with multiple watering
events in a day if it's needed,
[SPEAKER_00]: since it'll just be a quick program
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of going through and watering the
plants once a day, doing pulse irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: might be advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the drip irrigation is a system that
allows for minimal loss and allows this to
[SPEAKER_00]: be very easily done, especially if timers
are incorporated into the drip irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: system for your cannabis plants.
