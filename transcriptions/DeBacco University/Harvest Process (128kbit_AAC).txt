[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go through the basic
harvest process for cannabis, as we see
[SPEAKER_00]: that has occurred on the plants in this
image right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first one, the general process,
got four basic steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step one is to reduce or stop fertilizing
one to two weeks before the anticipated
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the length of time can depend on the
growing media and the fertilizer regimen
[SPEAKER_00]: that the grower is choosing to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically for soils, you're looking at the
one to two week span of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For cocoa coir, about waiting about seven
days or about that week or so time frame
[SPEAKER_00]: for hydro may only be one to two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the area that you're growing in
may influence that and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressiveness or the degree of fertilizer
that is being applied by the chosen
[SPEAKER_00]: grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after you reduce or stop fertilizing,
you're looking at flushing the plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: enough water to have about 25% leave the
root zone as excess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case for indoor operations,
you want to catch pan to allow that to
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: For outdoor applications, you're looking
at that little bit extra water that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: adding to flush the nutrients,
flush the water beyond the root zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond where those roots are capable of
taking that up to help reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for unwanted fertilizer in the
buds or plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next step is to remove the entire plant at
the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a downward image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut right at the base for an outdoor
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: With pruners, be careful not to disturb
the buds, which could impact trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: structures and resins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're seeing the basic plant
structure left in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pruned off here, starting at the
outside, working its way to the core.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be careful not to lay the
whole plant on the ground here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, a problem with potential
outdoor operations because that may kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of mess up some of the structures and the
resins here that the plants spend a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: time creating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, you want to manicure the buds,
taking care to remove small leaves with
[SPEAKER_00]: sharp scissors here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see you have an area to store
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can dry them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is where a little bit of that
manual labor does come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be kind of a time-consuming
process here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are automated options for larger
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is kind of the general
recommendation here, the summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit of a carefully
planned, kind of coordinated event here,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a chest match, because you're trying
to, or ultimately, your goal is to
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize the production here that you
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this bud trimming and manicuring that
takes place with those small, detailed
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors that is advised, that's where
we're preference there as far as what
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you are cutting the plants down
on a larger scale, you want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you are cutting them at the crown,
or simply removing large branches is the
[SPEAKER_00]: most efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main root ball can be left in the
container, as this does not contain any
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cutting it right down here at soil
line, or just removing the buds here,
[SPEAKER_00]: will ensure you're getting the maximum
amount of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post-harvest bud trimming, as I mentioned,
should have the smaller leaves pruned to
[SPEAKER_00]: help speed the drying process out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to leave it all kind of there,
might trap unwanted moisture, and it could
[SPEAKER_00]: be a site for a potential mold to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a labor-intensive process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there are automated machines that
can help do the majority of the initial
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is usually quality control that does
come in at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all this process should be occurred
shortly after harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't be waiting a long time to do
this bud trimming process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the equipment for bud trimming,
typically wearing disposable gloves of
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind, having good scissors,
pointed ends are recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: With even the variety of a good idea to
maximize the finished production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you could do an initial trim,
and then a more detailed trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you are saving the buds, but you do
want to potentially save these trimmings
[SPEAKER_00]: to improve the overall yield, and can be
made into hash or other concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the areas close to the buds may be
trimmed out, but they still may have an
[SPEAKER_00]: elevated level of cannabinoids that are
worth saving in going through some further
[SPEAKER_00]: purification process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, saving the trimmings is suggested
to improve the total yield, and can be
[SPEAKER_00]: made into hash or other concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is important because rather than
throwing this away, while it may not be as
[SPEAKER_00]: potent as the actual buds, it can be a way
to help increase overall yields,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to try to recoup some of the expenses
and time and labor that you spent
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating the crop.
