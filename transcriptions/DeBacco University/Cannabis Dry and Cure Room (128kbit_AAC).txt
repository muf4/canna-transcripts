[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I have the picture here of cannabis
plants drying and wine barrels showing
[SPEAKER_00]: wine that's curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: To kind of give the idea of the,
for cannabis, the drying and curing
[SPEAKER_00]: process is very important to kind of
finish off or finalize that end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the basics of a cure or dry room is
this room doesn't require a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what it is required is essential for a
good finish to that final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to lose it at the end
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure it dries down
efficiently, dries down well, to hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: show some of the best traits of the final,
what the plant has produced here as the
[SPEAKER_00]: final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lighting, well we want to keep that
minimum, or basically when we're lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: a dry or curing, we want to keep that as
minimal or as least as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: As those buds are curing, we want to keep
them in a dark environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, there's some lights,
and that's probably just for the picture,
[SPEAKER_00]: but overall a very dark environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry racks are advised, this can minimize a
total space required and allow for
[SPEAKER_00]: adequate air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that is required in a dry or
cure room is air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to cram all the plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to also allow air to be exchanged.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers have different ideas about
how exactly to dry or cure, or what the
[SPEAKER_00]: room should look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will dry the entire branch,
as we kind of see hanging here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others will only dry the buds,
and they'll trim the buds sometimes ahead
[SPEAKER_00]: of time also.
[SPEAKER_00]: That trimming allows for that drying
process to occur a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduces the chance of mold developing as
you have all those kind of leaves also
[SPEAKER_00]: with the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can increase the trapping of moisture in
there, and that can increase the chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: getting mold, which we want to try to
avoid in the total process, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: during the special drying care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice all these buds are very close
together, so if one was to become infected
[SPEAKER_00]: with mold, it'd be very easy for that to
spread throughout the entire room here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we want to make sure we're
monitoring conditions to check progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be able to catch potential problems early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if something was to go awry,
or something was to get out of whack,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to catch that early, because we
kind of have that final end product all in
[SPEAKER_00]: one location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that monitoring and checking is very
important to ensure a good finish and
[SPEAKER_00]: minimize the loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and have a great day.
