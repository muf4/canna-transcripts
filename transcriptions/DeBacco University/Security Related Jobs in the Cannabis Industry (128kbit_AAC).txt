[SPEAKER_00]: Here in this DeBaco University video,
we're going to be looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: security-related jobs and their connection
to the cannabis industry if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: considering pursuing this as a potential
career going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you might imagine, anything with
value needs security, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: security-related jobs within the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the general job description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as a security director, you want to
establish and maintain a safe,
[SPEAKER_00]: secure, and access-controlled environment
for employees as well as customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are also responsible for creating
and enforcing security procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this access control doesn't mean you
completely lock it up and no one can get
[SPEAKER_00]: in or out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure you have access
control, knowing who's coming in,
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing when they're leaving, and making
sure and having a check system for those
[SPEAKER_00]: that aren't coming in are authorized to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: in to the facility or growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this day-to-day activities oversees the
access control system and video monitoring
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of video monitoring is going on,
a lot of recording as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Determines employee access procedures,
and they also ensure the credential
[SPEAKER_00]: employees have access to certain areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're particularly a propagation area,
you don't need necessarily access to the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower room or the drying room if you're a
particularly large operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are responsible for the upkeep of all
security equipment, develops customer
[SPEAKER_00]: policies to prevent theft as well,
and conduct security audits to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is checking out on a continual
basis, and reports security breaches if
[SPEAKER_00]: one is determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also responsible for collecting,
document processing, and disposing
[SPEAKER_00]: deposits of all payments as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The money as well as the product need both
to be monitored and secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quality persons must have, if you're
looking at becoming a security person,
[SPEAKER_00]: is to be preferred law enforcement or a
legal background, and knowledge of federal
[SPEAKER_00]: and state regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good communication skills and ability to
pay attention to detail to spot any
[SPEAKER_00]: potential errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good organization skills for that
documentation and the involvement and
[SPEAKER_00]: implementation of certain policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the connection to the cannabis
industry, as I said, the security
[SPEAKER_00]: directors in legal jobs are necessary when
running a cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_00]: The safety and protection of the industry
and the entire operation is the most
[SPEAKER_00]: important factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see the vault area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be to a bank, but similar concept
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember when I still scheduled one drug,
making it a valuable target for possible
[SPEAKER_00]: theft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without a legal team, there's no way of
ensuring the business is safe,
[SPEAKER_00]: and having that security personnel and
those procedures in place will minimize
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential risk of having any sort of
theft occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why this security is so
important in many industries, but in
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
