[SPEAKER_00]: Many growers go through and purchase a
drip irrigation system, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: questions arise for how long should I run
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What drip tape should I purchase?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this Tobacco University video,
we're going to go over some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: calculations to get you over and past that
learning curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into drip irrigation
calculations for outdoor cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, realize that there are many
calculations that are possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many ways to go about calculating water
in regards to drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The following that we presented here is
generally the suggested process to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through when it comes to planning for your
drip irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the only way, but it is at least one
way, and I'll walk you through those
[SPEAKER_00]: steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, step one is determine the
drip tape required.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take your plot design, which hopefully
you've constructed, and determine the
[SPEAKER_00]: total number of drip tape that you would
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking at a very small area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking at a very large area?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if you had 12 rows of
plants, each 80 feet long, 12 rows,
[SPEAKER_00]: 80 feet each, you need 960 feet of drip
tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it doesn't matter if you're a
small operation or a large operation,
[SPEAKER_00]: this calculation still needs to be gone
through so you know exactly how much to
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then step part two is to calculate the
source of water in your flow rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a simple way to calculate this is
simply get a five gallon pail and a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn the water on full, start filling the
pail up, and start the timer at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the pail is full, stop the timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will provide you the time it takes to
reach five gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take this time and figure out how many
gallons per minute you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also do this filled up right to
a gallon or two gallons, but kind of get
[SPEAKER_00]: you that idea of that flow rate that you
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if it takes 23 seconds to
fill the pail, 60 seconds, 23.26.
[SPEAKER_00]: 26 times the five gallons would be 13.04
gallons per minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it takes you 72 seconds to fill the
pail, and again, this is a five gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pail, 60 seconds divided by the 72 times
it by the five gives you 4.6 gallons per
[SPEAKER_00]: minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a quick, easy way to calculate and
know what your flow rate is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as a word of caution, don't do this
right at the source.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have filters or timers or anything
that's going to restrict the flow rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: do this calculation after all of that
equipment so you're getting an actual flow
[SPEAKER_00]: rate that's going to go to your drip
tapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to select the drip tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of different
manufacturers out there, but here we're
[SPEAKER_00]: just going to look at some of the basics,
the emitter spacing and flow rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight inch emitter spacing is recommended
for sandy soil and high density planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a lot of plants in a
small area and very sandy soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: that water is going to percolate through
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight inches would be recommended in that
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, most situations you're looking at
12 inch emitter spacing is considered to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see some of them listed right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flow rate, there's low flow and
there's high flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low flow is greater for longer run times
and allows for more tape to be run.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flow rate is restrictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So low flow allows you to run more tapes
because they're flowing less water.
[SPEAKER_00]: High flow, shorter run times for when flow
rates are not restrictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have an excessive amount of gallons
per minute, you can go with a high flow
[SPEAKER_00]: and reduce your total duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will still receive the same
amount of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see calculated flow rate per
hundred feet at eight PSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be running your drip tape with
a 10 PSI pressure reducer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see the low flow can run 700 feet,
high flow 460.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you're a larger operation,
sometimes that lower flow might be
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then how long or what time does it take to
apply one inch of water?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at time to apply one
inch of water in hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low flow, medium flow, high flow rates,
emitter spacing, drip tube flow rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: drip tube flow rate at eight PSI here,
gallons per minute per hundred feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gallons per hour per hundred feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the time it takes to apply one inch of
water in hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times one inch of water per week
is considered to be the standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as an example, drip tape with a flow
rate of 0.45 gallons per minute per
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred feet will take about 5.8 hours to
apply one inch of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be running it for
approximately just under an hour every day
[SPEAKER_00]: would get you to that one inch of water
per week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here again, we see all the options
that we have, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little confusing, but if you kind
of go through and determine what drip tape
[SPEAKER_00]: you're purchasing, what your emitter
spacing is, this can again give you a very
[SPEAKER_00]: good starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now situation one, I'm going to walk you
through some examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have more gallons per minute from
the source than is required, if you had
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive amount of water, since Niagara
Falls, I don't have that much water,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you have seven gallons per minute
flow rate and you're running 960 feet of
[SPEAKER_00]: drip tape with a 12 inch emitter spacing,
and you're choosing to get the high flow
[SPEAKER_00]: drip tape, which is 0.45 gallons per
minute per hundred feet drip tape,
[SPEAKER_00]: the time required to apply one inch of
water would be 5.8 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we go about calculating this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, drip tape flow requires 4.32 gallons
per minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we have seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run drip tape for 50 minutes to deliver
216 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Running this for seven days equals 5.8
hours of a run time to match the one inch
[SPEAKER_00]: of water per week recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it went through that kind of grasp,
which you can kind of go through and plug
[SPEAKER_00]: in your own numbers and see how they may
fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can determine exactly how long to
run your water for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, 50 minutes here times the 4.32
gallons per minute gets you the 216
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons, which would be about that one
inch per week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, situation two is that what if you
have less gallons per minutes than the
[SPEAKER_00]: source requires for a little water short?
[SPEAKER_00]: Same seven gallons per minute flow rate,
but now we're trying to run 3,000 feet of
[SPEAKER_00]: drip tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same emitter spacing, same flow rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here now we're requiring 13.5
gallons per minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, stated up here, the source
can only supply seven gallons per minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there needs to be two zones made with a
valve so that 1,500 feet of drip tape runs
[SPEAKER_00]: at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run the drip tape for 50 minutes to
deliver 6.75 gallons per minute times 15
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes would equal 337 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Running this for seven days equals the 5.8
hours of run time to match the one inch of
[SPEAKER_00]: water per week recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here, if we have seven gallons
per minute, but we need 13 and a half,
[SPEAKER_00]: simply dividing your area into different
zones will allow you to meet those
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this all comes back to
calculating your water source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully if you pause the video,
look back at this, it's going to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: you with some helpful information to go
about applying your own flow rates and
[SPEAKER_00]: drip tape to these calculations to ensure
your plants are at least starting with one
[SPEAKER_00]: inch per water per week, and you can make
adjustments from there.
