[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here I'm going to go over the
basics of a gram stain, and this is used
[SPEAKER_00]: for identifying certain bacteria based on
the type of exterior structure that these
[SPEAKER_00]: prokaryotes have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gram stain, as it says in the name,
it's a staining technique for primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: identification of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something called a gram positive
and a gram negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does it refer to as gram positive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gram negative has this kind of protective
outer layer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't allow the stain to really
penetrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I think about gram positive,
you have positively accepting the dye,
[SPEAKER_00]: and gram negative not kind of accepting
the main dye there in the outer wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example here, we have our plasma
membrane, and this outer area here is our
[SPEAKER_00]: peptanoglycan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our gram positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how it's very thick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, there's a peptanoglycan layer and a
gram negative, but this exterior here is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a polysaccharide in the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: The peptanoglycan here is really good at
absorbing some of this purple dye,
[SPEAKER_00]: but because it's embedded below another
membrane, that stain really doesn't work
[SPEAKER_00]: all that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if it's a gram positive bacteria,
because of that thick peptanoglycan wall
[SPEAKER_00]: being on the outside, it is able to accept
some of that dye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the difference in dye retention depends
on the physical and chemical properties of
[SPEAKER_00]: the bacteria cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the exterior portion of the
cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gram stain was developed in the 1800s
by someone by the last name Gram,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's where it gets its name from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the basic procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just remember, gram positive bacteria
have thick, dense, relatively non-porous
[SPEAKER_00]: walls, while in comparison, gram negative
bacteria have thin walls surrounded by a
[SPEAKER_00]: lipid-rich membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of lipids as kind of repelling
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a detailed procedure here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go through it kind of step by
step for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example of the gram staining
procedure, what things are going to look
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're looking at basically making
our bacteria cells either purple or red.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's go through kind of this
procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I got this off online here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made some modifications myself,
but you always want to be careful to set
[SPEAKER_00]: your sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm including that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step one of a gram stain procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prepare the smear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're taking your bacteria and you're
smearing them on a slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suspense the material stained in drop of
water on a microscope slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spread the drop about the size of a
nickel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allow to air dry initially, then heat fix
by gently warming above the flame or other
[SPEAKER_00]: heat source.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this is doing, this is fixing the
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're basically sticking them to the
slide here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let the drop of water dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we re-wet, then we're just going to
slide around.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fixing procedure not only denatures
them, but allows them also to stick to the
[SPEAKER_00]: slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be careful making them as thin
as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too thick, it won't work really
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thin is very important here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, procedure two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apply the primary stain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flood the stain with, in this case,
crystal violet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very purple color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allow the stain for 30 seconds to a minute
and rinse water to remove excessive stain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, just the little circles and boxes
are different bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We flood the whole area with crystal
violet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we let it sit for a period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, here's our same bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We flood the smear with iodine solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll allow that to stand for 30 seconds
to a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice, technically at this point
of the gram stain procedure, all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria are purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple other important areas we'll go
through and we'll change those colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to rinse off and remove excessive
iodine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that all the iodine that was here
we've rinsed all that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we just tend to have all our cells
being purple, but we're not done yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step five is to decolorize.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an important step.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to dip 95% alcohol or drip 95%
alcohol across the entire slide for only
[SPEAKER_00]: about five seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will basically decolorize those cells
that aren't holding onto that stain very
[SPEAKER_00]: strongly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can notice here they're a lighter
purple color where these are still a
[SPEAKER_00]: strong purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let it sit for too long,
it will decolorize all the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only is the procedure and steps
important, but also timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we want to rinse to remove all excess
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that's going to do is kind of leave
us with the purple cells and now these are
[SPEAKER_00]: decolorized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to counterstain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The saffron solution is very kind of deep
red solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour this over the side and let this stand
for 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we want to rinse dry and observe.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that saffron stain does is it takes
those that don't have any color and it
[SPEAKER_00]: just binds lightly and those are gram
negatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want it to sit too long or kind
of mess up the crystal violet of the gram
[SPEAKER_00]: positives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why timing is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rinse with water, remove excess stain,
blot dry, and observe how the oil emerging
[SPEAKER_00]: of the microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is that same basic procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked you through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to pause the video and look
this over if you feel this might be more
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is kind of the end result that
you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, we can see if they're
very broad shaped or very circular shaped,
[SPEAKER_00]: both of these are gram positives,
indicating these have that very thick
[SPEAKER_00]: pycnoglycan wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example of gram stains for the negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you see the rods in the circles
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very thin pycnoglycan and
basically having a thicker lipid layer on
[SPEAKER_00]: the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here this slide contains both.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the previous image and this
contains both of the gram positives and
[SPEAKER_00]: gram negatives on the same slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking again, a little closer look at
those gram negatives, zooming in on that
[SPEAKER_00]: cell layers here, the cell walls,
we see there's an inner and outer
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pycnoglycan is located here kind of
sandwiched between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, that crystal violet can't
really bind or stick to this very well and
[SPEAKER_00]: this is why we call them gram negatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, here's a couple of video links if
you're interested in learning more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel that you just want to review,
you're welcome to watch the video again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope that was helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
