[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to discuss some of the very
important functions of the liver,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also feel the need to mention the
gallbladder, as you see located here,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is in such close proximity to
the liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the liver in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liver is the largest internal organ of the
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 3.3 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's divided into lobes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the main exocrine secretion is bile,
and it aids in the digestion of fats and
[SPEAKER_00]: the duodenum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it chemically modifies substances and
absorbs in the GI tract, and it converts
[SPEAKER_00]: poisons into less toxic forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very important function of the
liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's so large.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like the main filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a detoxifying of some of the toxins
that the body takes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also one of the only tissues that can
regenerate itself, indicating its
[SPEAKER_00]: importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tries to show a little bit of its
orientation in the body, and it produces
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the proteins found in the plasma
of the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's located right there, kind of
tucked up under your rib cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel under your rib cage,
you can actually feel your liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some very important functions of the
liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three main ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: All blood leaving the absorptive surfaces
of the digestive tract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have entering the hepatic portal
system flows into the liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the liver cells extract
nutrients or toxins from the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is before they reach the systemic
circulatory system through the hepatic
[SPEAKER_00]: veins you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of like intermediate
filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the liver removes and stores
excess nutrients, corrects nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies by mobilizing stored
reserves, performing synthetic activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of not only filtering things,
it's sensing and regulating and changing
[SPEAKER_00]: so that our body can do its best it can to
maintain homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on to give you a little bit of
that complexity of the liver, it regulates
[SPEAKER_00]: the composition of circulating blood,
waste product removal, nutrient balance,
[SPEAKER_00]: and nutrients can be carbohydrates,
lipids, and amino acids, vitamin storage,
[SPEAKER_00]: A, D, E, and K vitamins, nutrient storage
for iron, drug inactivation, and these are
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the crazy pathways that go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arrows indicate that it occurs,
and these lines here means that it could
[SPEAKER_00]: block that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have some unknowns here indicating
some of the pathways here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now do I need to know all the kind of
complexities here of the symmetry and
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibitory effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to understand some of the many
functions that the liver performs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, here's just six very
important regulations that it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hypocytes here, the liver cells,
how they function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they produce bile, see a bile duct
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's processing of blood borne nutrients
and they storage of fat soluble vitamins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also important for that
detoxification step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you see here, a very good amount of
surface area allowing this to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, what does the liver do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that question because there's about
500 vital functions of the liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very hard to kind of summarize them,
kind of only a couple, but I try to put
[SPEAKER_00]: like eight kind of major ones here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fagocytosis and antigen presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It removes damage for old red blood cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It synthesizes plasma proteins such as
albumin, reabsorbs hormone, removes
[SPEAKER_00]: antibodies and converts to amino acids,
traps some lipid soluble toxins,
[SPEAKER_00]: removes and stores certain toxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's keeping the body clean and it also
synthesizes and secretes bile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when I'm referring to toxins,
this isn't like, oh, you drink something
[SPEAKER_00]: toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of potential harmful things
that could occur in the body, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: in high amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's helping clean some of that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of drugs that may be taken,
prescription drugs usually go through and
[SPEAKER_00]: are processed in the liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why a lot of times doctors will
check for liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: They watch those blood, liver levels and
how that's kind of operating because that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be an indication of some of the
stresses that might be put on it or some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the particular products it might be
putting into the blood system as a
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction to something.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bile I've been mentioning,
the functions of bile, dietary lipids are
[SPEAKER_00]: not water soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful processing the stomach creates
large droplets containing lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the removal of bilirubin also results
from the breakdown of red blood cells and
[SPEAKER_00]: breaks down cholesterol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pancreatic lipase is not lipid soluble,
interacts only with the surface droplet of
[SPEAKER_00]: the lipid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we want to do is kind of like we
call this emulsify or break that apart,
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing that surface area allowing the
body to better absorb or break down these
[SPEAKER_00]: particular products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, bile salts break apart or
emulsifies as I said, they increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface area to allow enzymes to work a
little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tiny droplets are coated with bile
salts and that's what helps allow those
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes to be able to perform their
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last I said I mentioned the gallbladder
and that's this kind of looks green in
[SPEAKER_00]: these images here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's located kind of right behind the
liver there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pear-shaped, it's a muscular sac.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stores and concentrates bile prior to
excretion into the duodenum of the small
[SPEAKER_00]: intestine via this bile duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here's our pancreas again,
here's our gallbladder and here's our bile
[SPEAKER_00]: duct entering the duodenum which is the
first beginning part of the small
[SPEAKER_00]: intestine and dealing with the chyme as it
immediately enters or exits I should say
[SPEAKER_00]: the stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: This duct extends from the gallbladder and
this is allowing this bile to be
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately released into the beginning
part of the small intestine.
