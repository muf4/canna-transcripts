[SPEAKER_00]: So welcome to this Tabaco University
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be investigating genetic testing of
cannabis to determine genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of the picture here
looking at Gregor Mendelevec looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: just the morphology of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're studying plant genetics,
we tend to use more genetic testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll go over some of the techniques
here and present a research study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, using PCR was a very common
genetic tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you hear this term tossed around quite
a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what is PCR?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it stands for polymerous chain
reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a scientific process that
allows for small, theoretically one,
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence of DNA to be replicated to many
copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of times you're only dealing
with a very small amount of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is a way to kind of generate
multiple copies to help identify if the
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence is present in that original
sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is used quite a bit because it's a
very precise process and therefore can be
[SPEAKER_00]: really great at being able to pinpoint
very specific genetic sequences that a
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific investigator might be looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's genetic testing options.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be looking at whether a plant is
male or female.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get the genotype, the full
sequencing, or IP protection, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: intellectual property protection as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these relate to the cannabis
industry directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the research study that I'm going to
be presenting some of the data from,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be found right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have the reference right here or a
link there and kind of the picture of the
[SPEAKER_00]: first page if you want to look at it in
more detail yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, first off, gender detection screening
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is DNA, sex or gender testing
benefits of utilizing this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal of this is to be able to save
time by discovering if a plant is male
[SPEAKER_00]: months before it can be traditionally
detected or phenotypically detected based
[SPEAKER_00]: on the visual assessment of the flowers it
produces.
[SPEAKER_00]: By being able to detect this early,
this can save resources by identifying
[SPEAKER_00]: plants early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fewer plants need to be grown,
which reduces the input such as water,
[SPEAKER_00]: labor, nutrients, lighting, and a whole
host of other things that are needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize the space to grow plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upfront costs for the testing can be
justified by the reduction of cost of
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced plant care, at least in some
instances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the overview of samples
here, this is again going to that study
[SPEAKER_00]: that I showed earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four well-known varieties of industrial
hemp and six experimental varieties of
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal cannabis were included in the
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're kind of listed here to give
you some information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sample marking, variety or genotype,
the material, and the source or provider
[SPEAKER_00]: of that plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's three different primers pairs used
for sex determination.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see them listed right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the key part is while these are all
primers can be used, they do not all have
[SPEAKER_00]: the same reliability.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is referring to the actual primer
sequences, the actual sequence of the DNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: the amplification product, and then the
markers name provided here in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: column.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is the visualization of the PCR
products when we're looking for sex
[SPEAKER_00]: determination of cannabis varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is at the marker stated right
there on the MADC2 marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shows you kind of the different
varieties there and the different
[SPEAKER_00]: bandings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see the same banding,
that's indicating that that same DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: fragment exists there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see different bandings,
that's going to indicate that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: different lengths of those DNA fragments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see on the left here, we see the
marker, the latter as it's called,
[SPEAKER_00]: with this representing 1,500 base pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This represented 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever looked at a gel from PCR
products, the larger or longer sequences
[SPEAKER_00]: will be closer to where the wells where
the first DNA was put.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these smaller bands can travel
further through that gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see the data presented here from
the research study mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we kind of look at this, the
conclusions of the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the actual data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's kind of get to the
conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the markers that they were kind
of investigating, this SCAR119 marker
[SPEAKER_00]: appeared to be the most reliable for male
plant detection in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other two showed limited or even
controversial results at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: This study confirmed that sex
determination of cannabis plant is a
[SPEAKER_00]: complex process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see, as we look in the data here,
the genotype scoring and different
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties here, different markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would represent a plant with female
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a plant with male phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a monaceous plant of green color
indicating sample with genotype scoring in
[SPEAKER_00]: accordance with phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red colored samples with incorrect
genotype indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this again shows that the SCAR119
marker for the most part has all that
[SPEAKER_00]: green across the row indicating it was the
most reliable out of the ones studied and
[SPEAKER_00]: presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the cannabis genotyping just in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at that genotyping,
it's essential that the plant's blueprint,
[SPEAKER_00]: which includes the entire spectrum of
possibilities for a particular cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same can also be said for the human
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while this is very focused to the
cannabis industry, a lot of this also
[SPEAKER_00]: applies to other organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing precisely what defined
characteristics are in the plant will help
[SPEAKER_00]: guide decision-making when it comes to
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be very important, particularly
if you're looking at breeding or
[SPEAKER_00]: introducing a unique trait or strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that sequencing that I had mentioned
earlier, what is sequencing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's actually the sequence or the
order of all of the nucleotides within the
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be used to determine the
stability and uniqueness of a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant while also determining relatives,
origin, and ancestral lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the genetic code is known,
this can allow for new and unique strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a record of genetic sequences can
allow for protection against false patent
[SPEAKER_00]: claims and other legal controversy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to kind of have that as like
the blueprint or sequence of the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that you might be growing or
producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, when we're looking at kind of
genetics, sequencing for IP production,
[SPEAKER_00]: intellectual property production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greater amount of nucleotide bases
sequenced, the greater power of
[SPEAKER_00]: differential can be occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two classifications of
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the targeting and then there's the
whole genome sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So targeted of more than 3.5 million bases
across thousands of high-value targets,
[SPEAKER_00]: including 29 cannabinoid and terpene
synthesis genes, as well as several genes
[SPEAKER_00]: for seed production and sex determination.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where they're looking at very kind
of particular sequences that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: identified within the whole genome of the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare that to the whole genome
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This provides a data file that contains
the strain's full genetic sequence,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can be used to identify important
genetic markers and determine novelty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since chemist's genome is highly
polymorphic, single primer sets can often
[SPEAKER_00]: have reduced overall identification
abilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this important for IP production?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to protect what you might be
developing and the resources you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: putting into something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here with the sandals here being
examples of ones that you may see that as
[SPEAKER_00]: McDonald's and Nike initially,
but this is an example would be IP
[SPEAKER_00]: infringement, where we're looking at kind
of copying something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look very closely, you'll see
there's some code misspellings there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but close enough to determine that it's
infringing on the intellectual property
[SPEAKER_00]: agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same basic thing can happen here with the
genetics, where even if there's only like
[SPEAKER_00]: a little slight misspelling, it's
determined to be close enough that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous for growers, particularly
breeders of cannabis, to protect the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material that they've put so much time and
effort into creating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
