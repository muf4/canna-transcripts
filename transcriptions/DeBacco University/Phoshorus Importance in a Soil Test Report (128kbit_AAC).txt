[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBacco University video,
we'll be looking at phosphorus importance
[SPEAKER_00]: to plants in relation to a soil test
report.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while these tests typically are not
known for giving super accurate results,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can provide some indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really here, you'll be getting your
test at a professional lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to look at phosphorus
importance in a soil test report you would
[SPEAKER_00]: get from a professional lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the impact of phosphorus on
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus, chemical or elemental symbol
P, is essential for root development and
[SPEAKER_00]: the production of flowers and fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, it does get a lot of
attention from growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see here is a couple of the
things that are related to phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But root formation, promotion of flowers
and fruits are typical roles associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, phosphorus is being regulated in
more and more states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Native Connecticut soils, and this is
using Connecticut as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Native Connecticut soils are generally low
in phosphorus and much of what is present
[SPEAKER_00]: is bound in both organic matter and
inorganic forms not readily available to
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, over application has led to a
2013 law regulating the use of phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: on established lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus is a serious pollutant of
inland waterways, leading to algal blooms
[SPEAKER_00]: and accompanying environmental and human
health risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has gotten to the point that new
legislation or legislation has been
[SPEAKER_00]: enacted to regulate the use of phosphorus
in soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So realize that this could be a very
serious concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at these phosphorus
levels, phosphorus is most available in
[SPEAKER_00]: soil pH around 6.5 and during moist,
warm conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil tests provide an estimate of the
amount of readily available phosphorus and
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations are made accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal here is if it's very acidic,
very alkaline, a lot of that phosphorus is
[SPEAKER_00]: locked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pH just right, we have a lot of the
phosphorus being a plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what impacts the plant availability of
this phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's kind of a combination of
factors that do impact its availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned before, of course pH is one
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also looking at organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mineralization of organic matter releases
plant available forms of phosphorus into
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic molecules can also reduce
phosphorus retention, increasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of available forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clay content in soils, soils with higher
clay content have high phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: retention capacities simply because clay
particles have a very large surface area
[SPEAKER_00]: per unit volume, which can absorb
phosphorus very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mineral composition of soil influences
the phosphorus absorption capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example, soils with high content of
aluminum or iron ions tend to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest phosphorus absorption capacity,
which will decrease its availability to
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned before, soil pH,
optimum pH is between six and seven,
[SPEAKER_00]: which results in the maximum phosphorus
availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low pH, acidic soils have great amounts of
aluminum and iron, which form strong bonds
[SPEAKER_00]: with the phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: High pH soils, when calcium is dominant
cation, phosphate tends to precipitate
[SPEAKER_00]: with those calcium ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also other factors such as
temperature, moisture, and soil aeration
[SPEAKER_00]: can also affect the rate of phosphorus
mineralization from organic matter and
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in humid, warm condition climates,
organic matter decomposes faster compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to cool, dry climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also erosion and potential
runoff that can also occur that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to increase availability, we can also
have weathering, dissolution, and
[SPEAKER_00]: disabsorption as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we control how much phosphorus
you add?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, addition of phosphorus beyond the
agronomic need of crops has minimal effect
[SPEAKER_00]: on crop yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would you be adding more?
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the excess phosphorus is
susceptible to loss through runoff and
[SPEAKER_00]: erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can grow algal growth in freshwater
systems, causing degradation of water
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's important to know what
your phosphorus levels are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases where you've had the
optimum level, or probably above optimum,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can purchase fertilizers that do not
have any fertilizer in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 2404 is the example here because you
already know you've got enough phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: in your soil, so no need to add any more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would offer you the other
nutrients that your crops may need without
[SPEAKER_00]: running the risk of contributing to
freshwater contamination through algal
[SPEAKER_00]: blooms and general runoff of excess
phosphorus.
