[SPEAKER_00]: Now when people say growing cannabis,
a lot of people think of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil, the water, the fertilizer,
the substrate, lighting and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we also, particularly for indoor
growing, need to be aware of the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of HVAC jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this Tobacco University video is going
to cover the importance and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: details associated with an HVAC job if
you're considering that and merging that
[SPEAKER_00]: with the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into HVAC jobs in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the general job description
is that it performed skills on mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: maintenance duties in the inspection,
repair, installation and alteration of
[SPEAKER_00]: heating, ventilation, air conditioning and
refrigeration systems and related
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment and facilities perform
preventative maintenance and routine
[SPEAKER_00]: servicing of that equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot there, but for indoor
facilities where you're really creating a
[SPEAKER_00]: specialized indoor growing environment,
this is a very important job because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to maintain those consistent
conditions as a result need to heat one
[SPEAKER_00]: day, cool another day, add humidity,
reduce humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the day-to-day activities of someone
specializing in HVAC and kind of in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry is inspect, repair,
modify HVAC equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your heating, ventilation,
air conditioning equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be referred to condensers and
chillers and pumps, valves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot going on even in a small
cannabis growing facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to conduct regular preventive
maintenance inspections that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: changing filters out, for example,
inspecting units as far as boilers go or
[SPEAKER_00]: gas or electric operated air conditioning
systems, as well as evaporative coolers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goal of the HVAC person is to repair or
replace defective parts and or units and
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment in their control and that can be
thermostats, fan controls, heat
[SPEAKER_00]: exchangers, safety valves, and a whole
bunch of other things as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They operate a variety of hand and power
tools, welding torch, vacuum pump testing
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment to ensure that all the parts and
tools inventory is present and working
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what are some qualities if you're
looking at pursuing this as a potential
[SPEAKER_00]: career?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, work is performed while standing,
sitting or walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being physically fit is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also requires the ability to communicate
effectively even speech, vision,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as hearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Requires use of hands and simple grasping
of fine manipulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Requires bending, squatting, crawling,
climbing, and reaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of physical labor
involved here, installing all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not in the easiest part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be on your side through things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Requires ability to lift, carry,
push, or pull medium weights up to 75
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Requires activities involved being around
moving machinery, exposure to marked
[SPEAKER_00]: changes in temperature and humidity,
exposure to dust, fumes, as well as gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically high school diploma or GED
certificate is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years documentation of HVAC journeyman
level operation maintenance and repair
[SPEAKER_00]: experience in the HVAC and refrigeration
trade is also highly sought after.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the connection to the cannabis
industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the cannabis industry is widely
considered to be the fastest growing
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and is heavily reliant on HVAC
technicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically HVAC techs will have little to
no knowledge of what it takes to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and that can be perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a need for technicians who
specialize in various areas of HVAC,
[SPEAKER_00]: but understand the needs to create a
healthy cannabis growing environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: which creates a new area of study in the
HVAC cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do have some sort of background
in plants, having the HVAC background as
[SPEAKER_00]: well can really make you a potentially a
highly sought after future employee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
