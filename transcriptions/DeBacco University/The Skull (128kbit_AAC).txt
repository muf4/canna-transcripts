[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the title, it should come as no
surprise that this video lecture series
[SPEAKER_00]: will cover the skull.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be identifying some of the
bones within the skull and also some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the functions that this allows us to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So specifically the skull, what does it
do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some of its functions is protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It protects the brain in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also acts as an entrance for the
respiratory system and also the digestive
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 22 bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to make you memorize them
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to present them all to you and
even a couple more in some greater detail,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm going to highlight some of the key
ones that I want you to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't forget within the skull there's
also something called sinus cavities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of these is to decrease the
weight of the skull and they're also lined
[SPEAKER_00]: with mucous membranes and they protect the
entrance to the respiratory system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cover the respiratory system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes back a little bit to the sinuses
and the entrance point here is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: skull.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two sets of bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our cranium and our facial bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bones are joined by what's called
sutures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see them here as we're rotating
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the mandible is attached by a freely
movable joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the mandible is this portion
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our mandible highlighted in green
in this image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the skull bones here of the cranium
are kind of sutured or stitched away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it together here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of the cranial bones, just highlight
the couple here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our occipital, our temporal, our parental,
frontal, and cephaloid bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have these different bone regions
that we should be able to identify these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is one orientation of the skull.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you'll see in other slides and images,
these same bones may appear, but we may
[SPEAKER_00]: have a different view of the skull.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to be able to identify
these bones based on different
[SPEAKER_00]: orientations of the skull.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the 14 facial bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you may count these up initially and
the same thing goes for here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say there's not eight listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not 14 listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well remember there's actually two of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, there's two nasal bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just gonna look at these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to be able to identify right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mandible, as I mentioned, is kind of
the lower jaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the maxilla, there's two of them on
the left and right side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want you to know these is the
maxilla bones and this is the mandible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to distinguish the difference
between these is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inferior view of the skull.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you remember back from some of our
anatomical positions, inferior view,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking kind of from the bottom up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that evident here with the
maxilla here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our temporal bone where it's
located and here's our occipital bone here
[SPEAKER_00]: from the inferior view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of other bones I'm not
gonna get into, but we're kind of keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: track of these two in particular from a
different viewpoint that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet here's another viewpoint,
superior view.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from kind of the top looking
straight down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The frontal bone here, the temporal bone,
the parental bone, and the occipital bone
[SPEAKER_00]: again from the superior view.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, don't focus on the ones that I
didn't highlight at least for the purposes
[SPEAKER_00]: of my class, but you can see the degree of
complexity that occurs within a relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: small region called the skull.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paranasal sinuses, these are hollow
portions of bone surrounding the nasal
[SPEAKER_00]: cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see where they're located.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have sinus pressure and that's
usually because of the sinuses that are
[SPEAKER_00]: located right within the front of your
skull there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For my purposes in Mechanymy you can learn
all the different sinuses by name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can make sense that the frontal is kind
of near the frontal bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The maxilla sinuses where that maxilla
bone is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that there's names to
interrelate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The functions of these sinus cavities are
to lighten the skull and they also give
[SPEAKER_00]: resonance and amplification to voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because they're hollow, it's allowing
voice to kind of resonate and amplify a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, for my purposes in Mechanymy you
can learn them all, but you can see where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're located.
[SPEAKER_00]: So particularly if you have allergies or
sinus pressure, depending where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: located, you may need to identify the
specific name of the sinuses that has
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure or might be inflamed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hyoid bone, this is an important bone
to kind of be able to identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only bone that does not
articulate with another bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you see here in our slowly rotating
skeleton, you can see it's like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: floating.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because it doesn't articulate with
any other bone and this is true for the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire body here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the only one that's kind of like
free-floating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It serves as a movable base for the
tongue, so that's its purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to give you an idea where that
is located.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only one that does not articulate
in the entire body with another bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fetal skull, the fetal skull is large
compared to the infant's total body
[SPEAKER_00]: length.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of see in this image here,
in the embryo seven weeks after
[SPEAKER_00]: conception, there's kind of a
disproportionality here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fetal skull is large in relation to
the rest of the body length.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one thing that's a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that fetal level you're having that
change or that disproportionality of the
[SPEAKER_00]: skull being slightly larger in proportion
to the rest of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this individual continues to grow and
develop and become more proportional,
[SPEAKER_00]: but initially at the fetal stage,
the skull is actually disproportionate to
[SPEAKER_00]: the body length.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, remember from one of the previous
lectures, talked about five tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are those fibrous membranes
connecting the cranial bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They allow the brain to grow and they
convert to bone within 24 months after
[SPEAKER_00]: birth.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the soft spots on the baby's
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a graph here of the percentage
of infants with open fontanelles over time
[SPEAKER_00]: are a massive decrease from three months
old to 24 months old or two years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that degeneration at mean
time for closure of the anterior
[SPEAKER_00]: fontanelle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after about two years in most cases,
there's always one case here, in most
[SPEAKER_00]: cases by two years after birth,
24 months, these fontanelles have closed
[SPEAKER_00]: up and become ossified.
