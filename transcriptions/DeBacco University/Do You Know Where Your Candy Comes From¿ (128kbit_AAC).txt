[SPEAKER_00]: I was recently at CVS going through the
candy aisle when I flipped over one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: labels and saw this, where it says,
Product of Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little surprised at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as I looked at some other candies
on the rack, I noticed there were other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that asked the question, do you know
where your candy comes from?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the eight candies that I was looking at
and purchased are the eight represented
[SPEAKER_00]: right here, Gummy Bears, Double Bubble,
Sour Jimny, Jacks, Peppermint Starlights,
[SPEAKER_00]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what surprised me the most was these
came from totally different countries of
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put a world map here so you can take
a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: The eight countries with little arrows
highlighted here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going through them, these eight total
ones, the first one, Turkey, is where
[SPEAKER_00]: Gummy Bears come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Gummy Bears here came from Turkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Product of Turkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second one here, Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain is the Sour Jacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these Sour Jacks come all the way from
Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third one, Canada, neighboring
country, was the Bubble Gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only one of all these candies from the
United States were the Mini Lollipops.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the only ones that say product
of USA.
[SPEAKER_00]: South of the border, in Mexico,
Jelly Beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw before, the Jelly Beans come from
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbia, down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbia is where the Winter Riemanns come
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a bit odd that they've got to
travel all that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven, Argentina, this bar down in the
southern hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peppermint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not exactly sure why peppermint in
Argentina, but plenty of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one, which is kind of a
little scary, number eight from China,
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry Taffy Rope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Came all the way from China.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little scary when it says reading food,
and it goes through in the back,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is a made in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see enough stuff over here in the
United States, made from China,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting our candy from China may be word
of caution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the dog food isn't that we
had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of all of these eight different ones,
some are labeled as being genetically
[SPEAKER_00]: modified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Jelly Beans say specifically on
them, in the lower area here,
[SPEAKER_00]: down in that lower area, product of
genetic modification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little hard to see, this side here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Produced with genetic engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the date is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these foods do contain
genetically modified.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of food that we consume is
genetically modified, just now we're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to see the labeling for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I only made this video just to draw
your attention of, while all these might
[SPEAKER_00]: be sitting on racks right in the same
aisle, right in the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: think they're all candies within all the
same packaging, everything looks about the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you start to look at where it comes
from, you might want to second guess
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly where or what candies you're
purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, do you know where your
candy comes from?
Do you know where your candy comes from?
