[SPEAKER_00]: So in this Tobacco University video,
it might seem like a tall task,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you're looking at or considering
running a cannabis business, this video
[SPEAKER_00]: will give you a brief overview of some of
the qualities, day-to-day activities you
[SPEAKER_00]: should be looking at related to this
particular potential and future
[SPEAKER_00]: employment.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at some of the
specifics when it comes to running a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the general job description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually looking at a CEO, it's the chief
executive officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones kind of running the
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a leadership role and is
responsible for all internal as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: external relationships for the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They oversee the performance of sales,
marketing, operations, productions,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as finances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot on their plate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people want to be at top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, when you're at the top,
you've got a lot of responsibilities as
[SPEAKER_00]: well to be considerate of.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the day-to-day activities,
well, they can be quite varied,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they develop, review, refine a
company's business strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ensure proper execution of plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They provide leadership and oversight to
other departmental operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They enforce legal regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They submit budgets as well as forecasts,
maintain a company's goal and ethics,
[SPEAKER_00]: develop performance expectations as well
as ensure brand visibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with growing any sort of plant,
this can be quite a challenge because you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to have awareness, of what's going on
and it's kind of the day-to-day activity
[SPEAKER_00]: with the actual plants as well as kind of
the legal aspects and some of the business
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects as well to kind of balance both of
those worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growing environment and then the
executive kind of boardroom type
[SPEAKER_00]: environment as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's qualities that a person must
have to be a best fit for this kind of job
[SPEAKER_00]: title?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, typically a master's degree in
business administration, finance or
[SPEAKER_00]: organizational development is recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experience in leadership positions because
it is high stress, excellent communication
[SPEAKER_00]: skills, ability to work independently as
well as with others, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: well-organized and a disciplined worker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ability to manage diverse employees with a
range of skill sets as well as a range of
[SPEAKER_00]: duties and a drive in motivation because
you're gonna have to be kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: self-propelled because there's gonna be a
lot of pressure on you to persevere,
[SPEAKER_00]: to work through some of the challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be a great quality to possess
and have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the connection of the cannabis
industry is the CEO is the face of the
[SPEAKER_00]: company and overall can decide how the
company runs and operates at the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CEO sets ethical standards for the
company, creates goals for the company to
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve and keeps the company at a
competitive spot within the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what can make this challenging is the
industry can constantly be changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the CEO's job to change with it,
stay ahead of that change, invest where
[SPEAKER_00]: they need to invest to keep their company
the top of the competitive market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the CEO's job to change with it.
