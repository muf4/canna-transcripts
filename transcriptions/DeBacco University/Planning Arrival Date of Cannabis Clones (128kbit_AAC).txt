[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over planning the arrival
[SPEAKER_00]: date of cannabis clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to get them shipped in to allow
you to maximize your harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over planning the
arrival date for your cannabis clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, when planning for the
arrival date, you really actually want to
[SPEAKER_00]: start with the harvest date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to selecting that ideal
arrival date or week, you first want to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider when is your harvest date going
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at an outdoor operation,
you know, when are the leaves going to
[SPEAKER_00]: start turning?
[SPEAKER_00]: When is the photo period going to start
changing?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you should take into
consideration for when you want the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to be mindful of your
typical for outdoor locations,
[SPEAKER_00]: your typical starting and end date of the
growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: When's your last frost and when's your
first frost date that you're in for your
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're in an indoor operation,
you have much more flexibility and it
[SPEAKER_00]: really depends on if all of the equipment
is operational, you know, because you have
[SPEAKER_00]: control over the environment, control over
the photo period, the lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperature, hopefully the air
circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot more opportunities for
flexibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor locations, definitely more limited
and a little bit more precise with the
[SPEAKER_00]: date they want their clones to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for outdoor locations, you want to
know your growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's plenty of these charts for
different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to know what your plant hardy knows
hardiness zone map is, what region you're
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can really help you best pinpoint the
ideal location for of your location,
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal timing for your given location.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you an example here for
the southern New England area later in
[SPEAKER_00]: this presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to also consider the photo
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the photo period can be determined the
flowering time, except for if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: planting auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure to be the plant timing will
allow for plants to be large enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: support flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have it be too late or
too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see some photo period changes in
the duration of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the temperature lag
behind photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, all factors to take into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the description of that located
right here for the given area in Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this is true for any area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be mindful of what it is for your area
so you can maximize your production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I said later, I was going to give
you that earlier, I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to give you that southern New
England example.
[SPEAKER_00]: A general recommendation is to have clones
arrive in early June, that first or second
[SPEAKER_00]: week of June.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if growers want to have a second
planting that should arrive in late June
[SPEAKER_00]: or potentially very early in July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're considering this for the
southern New England area, it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: matches the native strawberry timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just something else there to use
some native plants in your area to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: gauge what timing you should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may use different trees,
different bushes for flowering times to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you an idea of when the season is
just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take this all into consideration,
but hopefully you can get that timing down
[SPEAKER_00]: to maximize your growing season and
ultimately maximize your harvest.
Thank you very much for watching.
Have a great week.
