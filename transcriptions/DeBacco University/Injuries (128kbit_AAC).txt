[SPEAKER_00]: Here's going to be a brief overview of
three main classifications of injuries
[SPEAKER_00]: that may occur on the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first one is sprains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ligaments reinforcing a joint are
stretched or torn in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partially torn ligaments slowly repair
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely torn ligaments require prompt
surgical repair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you or someone has a sprain,
you may be able to ask them if they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: grade one, a grade two, or a grade three
sprain.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, a higher grade is not a
better sprain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing, higher grade number
indicates a more seriousness to the
[SPEAKER_00]: injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grade one are just stretching or small
tears that may occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grade two is larger, but an incomplete
tear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grade three is a complete tear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the worst or most severe case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on with injuries, we also have
injuries to the cartilage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The snap and pop of overstressed
cartilage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common in aerobics injuries are repaired
with laparoscopic surgery.
[SPEAKER_00]: What laparoscopic surgery is here is we're
basically, instead of the doctors taking
[SPEAKER_00]: their actual instruments and going into
the patient, laparoscopically our small
[SPEAKER_00]: holes are punctured in and it's basically
kind of through the doctor's control,
[SPEAKER_00]: but basically through robotic arms and
they watch a TV screen and it allows for
[SPEAKER_00]: fine detailed movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows for the delicate repair of
certain muscles or ligaments that may
[SPEAKER_00]: occur as a result of aerobics or
potentially sports.
[SPEAKER_00]: For injuries here, damage to the cartilage
in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that here where we have maybe an
impact or the foot got stuck in the turf
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that rotation up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that tearing here of a ligament.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly for injuries are dislocations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it occurs when bones are forced out of
alignment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're usually accompanied by sprains,
inflammation, and joint immobilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Serious falls or common sports injuries
can cause dislocations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in relation to this you may have here
people saying kind of like they're double
[SPEAKER_00]: jointed and that kind of really doesn't
exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no such thing as a joint that can
move kind of in two different directions,
[SPEAKER_00]: classify as a different type of joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has to do with people, some people
can, are able to dislocate certain joints
[SPEAKER_00]: of their body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to learn more about this
potential kind of double jointed or what
[SPEAKER_00]: we may call double jointed and dislocation
here, or double jointed medical course,
[SPEAKER_00]: how these people with extremely flexible
ability to dislocate their shoulders would
[SPEAKER_00]: be very painful in some cases,
you can learn more about those in these
[SPEAKER_00]: two videos located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is again a brief overview of three
different types of injuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
