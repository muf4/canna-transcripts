[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at
different types of microscopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of general categories
that they all fit into, and we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: investigate some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In class, we mainly work with one type,
but they are different ones for different
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like people have different jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different ones for different
substances a scientist may want to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Students may think they need a microscope
to look at their small, tiny grades,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in this case, we're going to be
looking mainly at cells and different
[SPEAKER_00]: sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with the first one, the compound
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one you're probably most
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks very similar to this in many cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be some variations depending
on the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at compound light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a light source at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's these ocular lenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, it's basically using a magnification
with the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are focused glass lenses,
and the image is really being formed in
[SPEAKER_00]: the back of your eye as you look through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically resolving images about 500
times better than what the human eye can
[SPEAKER_00]: see if you were just to look at something
in general there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the parts are labeled here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here the ocular lens in
particular, or the eyepiece is located up
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the objective lenses down here,
and those can have different
[SPEAKER_00]: magnifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're looking at magnification,
when you're actually taking images or
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at pictures, you want to be sure
you're taking into account the objective
[SPEAKER_00]: lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, any magnification that the ocular
lens may add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, it's a factor of 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this was times 100, it'd be times it by
an additional 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be actually a thousand times more
strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The objective lens is you have to find the
focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the coarse focus, the light
source, the diaphragm to allow more or
[SPEAKER_00]: less light through.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're having trouble finding something
on a slide that looks like it's on there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you always want to start at low power,
and you want to adjust the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put too much light, it may shine
right through and basically make it
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible to see the specimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some images taken with a
compound light microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are cheek cells, chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see muscle cells here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nice to find in here looking at
different cell stages, and these are all
[SPEAKER_00]: taken with a compound light microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be familiar with what
microscope images that they produce so
[SPEAKER_00]: you're able to identify that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting a little bit more unique,
something you may not be familiar with,
[SPEAKER_00]: the transmission electron microscope,
or the TEM.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows electrons to pass through the
specimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is max magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very strong, about 100,000 times
better than the human eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very complex, very expensive piece of
equipment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good reason why it has an electron
gun, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's passing those electrons through the
specimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: How those images look and it's typically
for very small items, such as viruses,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the poliovirus looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is taken through a TEM, or
transmission electron microscope,
[SPEAKER_00]: small tissue section, and it's bacillus
bacterium, all taken with transmission
[SPEAKER_00]: electron microscopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another type is called scanning electron,
SEM.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the specimen is coated with
a very thin coat of metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The electron beam is passed across the
specimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally like a scan that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it like a copier machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's viewed on a large TV screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you don't have to know the
complexities of everything here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but again, we're using electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part here is it's coated with a
thin metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one, transmission went through.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a scanning of the actual
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, we get some very detailed,
very unique images of what pollen grains
[SPEAKER_00]: look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the adhesive on a post-it note.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see, well, we think it's kind of
sticky and flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually how it looks very zoomed
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, because we're scanning and we're
getting bounce back from the electrons,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically images come back as black and
white.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, through modern-day tools,
we're able to colorize some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: images to give them a bit more of a vivid
appeal, make it easier to spot certain
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, here, the yellow structures
almost look a little blended in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not even notice that they're
there on this black and white image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, they're very vibrant, very easy to
tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's a little bit more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The immunofluorescence light microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this uses, and this is an example of
it, it's using antibodies developed
[SPEAKER_00]: against a specific protein that have a
special dye attached to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening is the antibodies are
binding to something in particular with
[SPEAKER_00]: this fluorescent dye, allowing it to be
illuminated with an ultraviolet or a black
[SPEAKER_00]: light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows mapping and distribution of
specific proteins within a cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this look?
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be a little confusing,
a little bit different than what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a great summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are both kind of showing very
similar, the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our antigen, and we're trying to
identify this little green circle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first case here, we have a primary
antibody with the tag on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, basically, we're putting this
antibody in solution, bouncing it around,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's finding this one little green
circle, and it's binding specifically only
[SPEAKER_00]: to that green circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, because it's bound to only that green
circle, that is the only spot this actual
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorophore, this basically light emitting
substance will be attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it allows us to identify this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The secondary immunofluorescence is kind
of very similar to the first one where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're still identifying the green circle
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we're first using a primary
antibody to bind to that, and then we're
[SPEAKER_00]: using our secondary antibody that actually
is labeled or tagged to bind to that green
circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an antibody.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this allows for is, you can see here,
multiple bindings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, one green circle, one antibody's
binding might produce a weaker signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we allow our secondary antibody can
bind multiple times to that original or
[SPEAKER_00]: that single primary antibody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of that, we're able to get maybe a
stronger signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these are accomplishing the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're identifying a very specific
component of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Antibodies are extremely specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, we can label them to look at
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first image, we're identifying this
particular DNA, and that's blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're using the green to identify a
different structure, and here,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're using the red to identify another
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we just add that single antibody,
we just get the blue, we just get the
[SPEAKER_00]: green, we just get the red.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we combine all those antibodies,
we're able to now see a better picture of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell of where specifically different
components might be located.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the power of the amino fluorescence
light microscope image, is that we're able
[SPEAKER_00]: to determine or hash out where different
things might be located based on their
[SPEAKER_00]: color, because we're using specific
antibodies to bind to specific antigens or
[SPEAKER_00]: specific proteins in certain cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair questions on quizzes or tests might
be showing an image, and you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify what microscope was used.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're playing along in our home game,
I have a series of images, and the last
[SPEAKER_00]: slide will have the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm simply not going to go through and
answer the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can play along and say, what
microscope made this image?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is image one.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about image two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the microscopes that we learned
ahead of time, what image, looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: this, what microscope may have made this
image?
[SPEAKER_00]: For those continuing, number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, what microscope was used here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one, four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, don't let the colors fool you.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we learned before, some can be
colorized, some cannot be colorized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I added two more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another prime example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hint, the microscopes may be used more
than once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our last one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What microscope made this image?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those looking for the answers,
playing along in our home game,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's our six answers to the six
different images.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice the compound light
microscope was not used in any of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably very familiar with that
one, so I included these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But please realize that the compound light
microscope image is fair game for test or
[SPEAKER_00]: quizzes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope this was helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
