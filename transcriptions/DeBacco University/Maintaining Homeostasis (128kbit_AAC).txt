[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at a little more
detail how your body goes about
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's why I have this picture here of
someone balancing on the railing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what your body is trying to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to maintain this balancing act
that's occurring despite changes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in your body on a daily,
hourly, minute-by-minute basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting first with the basics of
homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have our homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be nice and level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an imbalance that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that imbalance needs to go through a
receptor to detect that change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to go to a control center of some
sorts that then will send out an effector
[SPEAKER_00]: which will respond to that change and help
correct that potential imbalance that did
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's important to realize that
homeostasis does not involve keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions static.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be changes that occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's important to remember is that it
involves keeping conditions within a
[SPEAKER_00]: tightly regulated limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can change all we want in here,
but if we want to go outside of this
[SPEAKER_00]: range, this is where we have issues that
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this homeostasis is keeping this very
tight range, so slight changes are
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring, but it's occurring within a
very tight range, this very tight
[SPEAKER_00]: balancing act.
[SPEAKER_00]: To go back to our person balancing on the
railing, you can waver a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you waver too far, you're going to fall
one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep calm and maintain homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's allocate some examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a negative feedback model which
calls for a specific body condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have something increasing, a gland
releasing a hormone causing a lowering of
[SPEAKER_00]: that condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we have a wave, something's
getting too high to lower that condition,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, if the body overcorrects and over
lowers the condition, there needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: typically be another hormone that will
then raise that condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how our body is able to try to
maintain that homeostasis, is to maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: it's raising, it's trying to bring it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too low, it's trying to bring it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trying to bring it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take this as an example,
particularly looking at the nervous
[SPEAKER_00]: system, tied in with body temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if our body temperature, if we're
increasing our body temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have nerve signals that respond to
that, that will cause our body to sweat
[SPEAKER_00]: and dilate our blood vessels.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will hopefully cool our body
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if our body temperature gets too
cold, then we will need a way,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have different nerve signals that will
cause this to shiver, constrict our blood
[SPEAKER_00]: vessels, that will then hopefully cause
our body temperature to raise,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're able to maintain that nice,
consistent body temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our brain, we have the hypothalamus,
which is involved in regulating body
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a way of both lowering our body
temperature or raising our body
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecting this with the endocrine system,
we can look at the blood sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our blood sugar level, if the ink gets
too high, we have insulin, that'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: secreted by the pancreas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Body cells take up sugar from the blood
and reduce our appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if it overshoots, and we put too much
sugar into our cells, and our blood sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: level gets too low, glucagon will be
released, and this triggers hunger,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this, the liver will release glucose
from the cells, increasing blood sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will hopefully, through this
system of insulin and glucagon,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll be able to maintain a consistent
level or a consistent range of blood sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: in the body system.
