[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at natural
selection and how it relates to behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting out, natural selection and
binocular vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So behavior in this sense, we're looking
at how an animal, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: has its eyes oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So binocular vision is having two eyes and
being able to perceive an object in 3D.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's five main advantages to having two
eyes versus only one.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a backup eye, in case
something happens to the left or the
[SPEAKER_00]: right, you have the other eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this ability to see around objects,
I want to think this is like a superpower,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you've kind of ever seen something,
it might be blocking one of your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look through the other eye,
you're able to see sometimes around
[SPEAKER_00]: something, it might be obstructing your
initial vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the wider field of view and depth
perception are all very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: How these relate is the position of the
eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eye position can help determine if the
animal is typically a prey or a predator,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this can influence its ability to
avoid one or find the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a pigeon tends to be low on the food
chain and has a very wide field of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: The binocular vision area is very small,
but its field of view is quite large.
[SPEAKER_00]: An owl being a predator has a reduced
field of view, but has a greater amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: binocular vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some good examples to kind of compare on
how their eyes might be oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these can be found around my
classroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The deer, no matter where you stand in the
room, depending on, as long as you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: blocked by anything, the deer can see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The raccoon and deer are both facing the
same direction in my room in particular,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that when you look and you can be seen
by both, as you work your way around,
[SPEAKER_00]: the raccoon will no longer be able to see
you at a certain portion, but the deer
[SPEAKER_00]: will always be able to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give the example two of the aquatic
species, the fish and the blue crab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want to be thinking about how
their eye position is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural section behavior, adaptive traits
allow evolutionary advantages in different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Behaviors can reduce predation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some birds will take the eggshell and be
moved by gulls to reduce predation,
[SPEAKER_00]: by crows to increase the camouflage of
those eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other behaviors can enhance energy uptake,
can allow more offspring to be supported.
[SPEAKER_00]: Behaviors also can increase resistance to
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example here is eating a healthy diet can
help reduce your incidence of getting
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other behaviors can enhance the ability to
acquire a mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here could be the mating ritual or culls.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those are perfected or performed well,
they can increase the odds of finding and
[SPEAKER_00]: acquiring a mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural selection behavior, every behavior
that offers a survival advantage for an
[SPEAKER_00]: individual comes with an associated cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a behavior to be favored by natural
selection, the benefits must outweigh the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give the example here of the penguin
courtship, where the male penguin goes
[SPEAKER_00]: around and creates a nest of rocks,
and the goal is to have a better rock
[SPEAKER_00]: selection than those around him,
so that the female will select him.
[SPEAKER_00]: As example here, cost and benefit ratio is
involved with all walks of life,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the benefits must outweigh the cost,
otherwise it's not advantageous for that
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reproductive behaviors encompass a variety
of animal behaviors, including courtship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Competition for mating opportunities has
been termed sexual selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intrasexual selection is where individuals
of the same sex compete for a mate from
[SPEAKER_00]: the opposite sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is usually males, and there's been
entire TV shows dedicated to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intersexual selection is essentially mate
choice, where the female is able to select
[SPEAKER_00]: what mate they would like to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So focusing a little bit more on that
intersexual selection or mate choice for
[SPEAKER_00]: the female, the female is ideally looking
for a male that provides the best
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring care, could provide the best
territory, could provide the best genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the rams here, they will butt heads
until the alpha male is determined,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the alpha male will be the one that
gets the rights to the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see the example here of two
individuals with different amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: showiness to their feathers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This male has a little bit more showier
feathers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This female selects that as a mate,
and then you can see the resulting
[SPEAKER_00]: population increases the showiness of
their feathers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some other good links to some YouTube
videos indicating showing this mate choice
[SPEAKER_00]: in intersexual selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The typical number of mates an animal has
during its breeding season is called the
[SPEAKER_00]: mating system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So monogamy is one male and one female,
polygamy is one male and many females,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is more common in polyandry,
which is with one female with many males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see them again represented
here, what certain ape or monkey species
[SPEAKER_00]: might participate in one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chimps are monogamy, one male and one
female, and you can see here with one
[SPEAKER_00]: versus many, one male and many females
polygamy, and polyandry is one female with
[SPEAKER_00]: many males.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, the polygamy is much more common in
the world here of apes and monkeys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Altruism in group living.
[SPEAKER_00]: So altruism is the performance of an
action that benefits another individual at
[SPEAKER_00]: the cost of the actor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So helpers at the nest in some bird
species, and centennial is a term for
[SPEAKER_00]: animals that give a predator alarm calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give the meerkat example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The meerkat that specifically is on the
lookout for potential harm to the
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: They then sound the call and let all the
individuals know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes at a cost to the individuals
who are constantly scouting and needing to
[SPEAKER_00]: alert others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this altruism is a behavior that's
helpful to others, but clearly requires
[SPEAKER_00]: self-sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give the example here of giving to
the homeless.
[SPEAKER_00]: The existence of altruisms amongst animals
is rather perplexing, and natural
[SPEAKER_00]: selection should operate against it
because there's a cost to an individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where we get into the
complexities of some local behaviors of
[SPEAKER_00]: animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Altruism in group living.
[SPEAKER_00]: So altruism behavior may not truly be
altruistic after all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The actor may have some sort of benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nest helpers may get parenting experience
or inherit territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Centennials may be able to escape
predators in the confusion on the alarm
[SPEAKER_00]: call.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the example of the meerkats.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might sound the alarm, causing
everyone to kind of scurry around not sure
[SPEAKER_00]: what to do, and they may be able to escape
the predators in amongst the confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And altruism compensates for a reduction
of its own reproductive success by
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing that of its relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selection that favors altruism directed
towards relatives is called kin selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kin referring to family.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more closely related two individuals
are, the greater the potential genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: payoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this hand here by this graph,
which I think is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows helpers tend to be close
relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helpers assistance increased with genetic
relatedness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the probability of helping,
the percent increases here, degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: relatedness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the closer they're related,
the more likely they are to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of relate this if you're moving
or need to be picked up from the airport,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're more likely to ask a full sibling
or maybe a half sibling than you are a
[SPEAKER_00]: cousin or someone more distantly related
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this helps explain natural
selection and some behaviors associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with that.
