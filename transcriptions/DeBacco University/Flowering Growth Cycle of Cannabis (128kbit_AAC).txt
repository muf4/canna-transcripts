[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we'll look at flowering growth
cycle of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see in the picture here that
initial kind of female flower starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: be produced at the apical meristem of this
branch there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to investigate just a little
bit more about this growth cycle that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant goes through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flowering first is induced by an even
12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key, remember, is those 12 hours of
continuous darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the change, plants will show visible
response in under two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you kind of go from those 16,
18 plus hours of light to 12 hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: light and dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: After this change, that's where you're
going to start to see within about two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks time those flowers develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This mimics the fall season where nights
begin to get longer, which is typically
[SPEAKER_00]: when plants want to begin to prepare
flowers to carry on for the next
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as a plant prepares for fall time,
in New England we have the leaves that
[SPEAKER_00]: turn different colors, indicated by that
shortening days.
[SPEAKER_00]: For cannabis, the vegetative part or phase
of the plant will begin to slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will still grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stems may still stretch and leaves may
still grow, but they may produce less
[SPEAKER_00]: blades and typically vegetative growth
will be slowed for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when plants are needing less
nitrogen in their fertilizer program,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is where bloom fertilizers come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bloom photos are typically higher in
phosphorus, which can become integrated to
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage flower production into your
nutrient reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the flowering stage is when most of
the cannabinoid and terpene production
[SPEAKER_00]: will occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is considered, flower rooms are often
considered the money room, even though it
[SPEAKER_00]: is important to set your plants up well
through the vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember your chosen cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis rhodalis will flower
automatically in about three or four-ish
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks of growth, regardless of the photo
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some late blooming sativa
varieties that may need special care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just knowing your cultivar that
you've chosen to grow and all the pros and
[SPEAKER_00]: cons associated with that ahead of time
will be best for your operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
