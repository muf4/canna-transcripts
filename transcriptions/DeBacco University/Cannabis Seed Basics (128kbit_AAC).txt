[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to focus on cannabis
seed basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see just a general seed pictured here,
where we have the seed coat, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: outer shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The embryo contains the hypocotyl,
the radical, and the cotyledons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look specifically at cannabis
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, seeds in general, whether it's a
cannabis or a tomato or a pepper seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: all contain living but dormant organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important to remember that in
that seed is a living organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the organism dies, that will reduce
the germination rate of a living organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the DNA is also present in these
seeds, which will determine the
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And selecting the proper seed,
or a really more appropriate term to do
[SPEAKER_00]: the proper genetics, to match the growing
conditions is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Items to consider are whether you're
growing indoors or outdoors, looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: THC or CBD production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind this course is focusing on
hemp plants, so CBD production would be
[SPEAKER_00]: one area that would be focused on much
more than THC content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mature seeds have a dark coloration that
are hard, and they tend to be dark
[SPEAKER_00]: coloration hard outer shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tend to be the most mature and have
the greatest chance for germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at this kind of lot seeds
here, this kind of compilation of seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: we know some are kind of white,
some are green.
[SPEAKER_00]: These colorations also indicate that these
tend to be softer seeds to the touch,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these indicate immature seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These will have poorer germination rates
than the harder outer shell that's
[SPEAKER_00]: typically shown with this darker
coloration here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The darker coloration will have a greater
germination rate than the immature seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Developing a comparison between our mature
and immature seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mature seeds should be full and uniform,
as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them a drop and listen for a thud.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hear a hollow sound like these
seeds would give, this is a sign of
[SPEAKER_00]: immature seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see the comparison of these two
with the dime there for size orientation.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that these are very consistent,
tend to be darker colorations,
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to be more consistent, larger size.
[SPEAKER_00]: These will likely have a much better
germination rate than these immature
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed anatomy, we have the seed coat,
as I mentioned, that's that protective
[SPEAKER_00]: outer covering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have cotyledons and cannabises and
dicot.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the seed leaves, and these will
be the first ones to appear once the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: emerges.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hypo cotyledon, located right here,
is the area of the stem above the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: and soil line, and also the cotyledon
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The radical is the initial root that is
produced from the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talk about emergence, that's the
seed actually plant breaking through the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germination is typically marked by this
radical protruding through the seed coat
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be like a little tail that you would
notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proper seed storage, while controlling the
environment the seed is stored will help
[SPEAKER_00]: increase germination percentages over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Key is consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's rapid fluctuations and changes,
this can decrease seed vitality.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, even under ideal conditions,
germination rates will decrease with the
[SPEAKER_00]: age of the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing conditions, the goal to try to
maintain is humidity under 10%,
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature from 40 degrees Fahrenheit to
zero degrees Fahrenheit, and light,
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal light, if any, exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to keep the seeds typically in the
dark or in an area that is not having a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of consistent or very bright light
exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds should be kept in some form of
label package in an environment that is
[SPEAKER_00]: cool and dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be like a refrigerator,
a freezer, even a sock drawer in some
[SPEAKER_00]: cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seeds will last about five years if
stored properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be sure to keep seeds away
from moisture, and this is a concern as a
[SPEAKER_00]: preventive when you're storing your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to choose an airtight container,
and these little silica gel packets can be
[SPEAKER_00]: advised to be included to help pull some
of that moisture out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Labeling those seeds are very important
because you can see these can easily get
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed up, so keeping them labeled,
keeping them sealed allows for reduction
[SPEAKER_00]: in the chance of misaligning different
seeds and ensuring you're growing what you
[SPEAKER_00]: think you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, canning jars offer an excellent
for seed storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are airtight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can hold many seeds in different
containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fit easily in the freezer or other
locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also prevent unwanted interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give the example of the mice here eating
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just keep a seed in like an envelope
or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gets cold out, mice can be
voracious eaters and get into all sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: things and easily chew through paper or
even sometimes plastic containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mason jars here are sealed, glass,
airtight, will prevent any unwanted
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding on your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching.
See you next time.
