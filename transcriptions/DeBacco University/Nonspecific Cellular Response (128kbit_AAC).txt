[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this video is going to look at some
of the non-specific cellular responses of
[SPEAKER_00]: the immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they're all listed here, such as
physical barriers, phagocytes,
[SPEAKER_00]: extracellular killing, inflammatory
response, fever, interferons, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: complement system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to focus mainly on fever and
some of the brief overviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these can also be found in other
videos there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they all have in common, this
non-specific cellular response,
[SPEAKER_00]: is kind of like the spider putting the web
out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or casting out the cast net.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-specific, just kind of catching
whatever comes through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these systems just kind of kill
or prevent sources of infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them are very specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is what we're talking with
non-specific cellular responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are still providing very important
functions, but they're non-specific here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We classified some as part of that innate
immune system, when we're born with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this second line of defense,
just to mobilize them quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: is inflammatory response is also kind of
falls under this category.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body uses non-specific cellular
chemical devices to protect itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be phagocytes and natural killer
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a whole separate deal on
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Antimicrobial proteins in blood and tissue
fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inflammatory response can be macrophages,
mast cells, white blood cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: and chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to keep in mind that
harmful substances are identified by
[SPEAKER_00]: surface carbohydrates unique to infectious
organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we see here, our cell phospholipid
bilayer has many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just the phospholipid bilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many surface carbohydrates here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on in the surface,
and that's very important for cell-to-cell
[SPEAKER_00]: communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: In part, that is how certain cells are
able to determine cells that are self and
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't be destroyed, or foreign
invaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: That do not belong in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: One we're going to focus on here is a
fever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a non-specific response here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, abnormally high body temperature in
response to invading organisms is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the definition of a fever here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body's thermostat is reset upwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, normal body temperature is about 37
degrees Celsius, or 98.6 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit, and pyrogens are chemicals
secreted by leukocytes and macrophages
[SPEAKER_00]: when exposed to bacteria and other foreign
substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: In part, the hypothalamus, located here in
the brain, regulates body temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: When your body's inducing a fever,
it's upregulating that temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting at above 98.6 degrees on
average.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as we know, certain proteins can
denature at very high temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're saying raising the body
temperature, while we may feel extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: hot, it's not necessarily going to move
all that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reason being, for our fever, if we have a
high fever, they're extremely dangerous,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they can denature our own enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here's our normal body temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a medical emergency if we get
too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, hypothermic if we get too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fevers are not used to directly kill the
invaders, because fevers greater than 40.6
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Celsius, or 105 degrees
Fahrenheit, are often fatal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we don't want to elevate our
temperature much above that, because we
[SPEAKER_00]: will denature our own enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what our body does is a moderate
fever can be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're moderate, not high.
[SPEAKER_00]: The primary benefit is an increase in the
metabolic rate, which speeds up tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: repair.
[SPEAKER_00]: About every degree in temperature equals
10 times metabolic increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, by increasing the temperature and
the metabolic rate, can also cause the
[SPEAKER_00]: liver and spleen to sequester iron and
zinc, which are needed by microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it means sequester, it means kind of
bind up and use.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may help slow infectious growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as much as we think a hot fever is
destroying all the invaders by just heat
[SPEAKER_00]: killing them and denaturing all their
enzymes, may not be 100% the case,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if we get too hot, we will
denature our own enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's really helping with is increasing
the metabolic rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, some enzymes may be denatured,
or at least reduced in their
[SPEAKER_00]: effectiveness, but we're really looking at
the metabolic rate speeding up repair,
[SPEAKER_00]: and helping slow the growth of infectious
organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: By sequestering iron and zinc.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
