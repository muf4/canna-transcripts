[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we get into comparing bullets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking here, we can definitely make
some comparisons just based on the visual
[SPEAKER_00]: images I provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at this in a little
more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with that detail, we want to
be looking at using a microscope,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically a comparison microscope,
which looks like basically two microscopes
[SPEAKER_00]: in one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a device used for that side-by-side
analysis of specimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It consists of two microscopes connected
by an optical bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this results in a split view.
[SPEAKER_00]: View window enabling two separate objects
to be viewed simultaneously, which is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important when you're looking at trying to
match these two comparisons up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This avoids the observer having to rely on
memory and comparing the two objects,
[SPEAKER_00]: the conventional microscope, and jumping
back and forth between two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So allows this kind of double view to
allow things to see if they will line up
[SPEAKER_00]: or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also have something to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want to be looking at the boldface
signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is again at the quote bottom of
the cartridge here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The firing pin impressions and breech
block markings on the primer are also
[SPEAKER_00]: called boldface signatures because they
can kind of unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be compared first because they
can only be produced by firing the
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridge in the firearm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you find a kind of something that
has not been fired by a gun, you will not
[SPEAKER_00]: find any of these boldface signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are only found on ones that have
been fired through the firearm because
[SPEAKER_00]: they have that back pressure that comes
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chambering extractor injection in
magazine marks may be made by loading
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridge in a weapon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without firing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may get some of those, but you
won't get kind of the breech mark markings
[SPEAKER_00]: until it's fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now developing this comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of having that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how do we know that one was fired
from that gun?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to test fire bullets are fired
through the firearm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you kind of test that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the resulting bullets are then
compared with each other's to verify
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency of the marks within the
firearms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's typically done is the gun from
the suspected crime is taken and both are
[SPEAKER_00]: fired through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in order to minimize damage to the
bullets so they can be used for comparison
[SPEAKER_00]: or analysis, they're fired into a long tub
of water here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bullet is fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes through the same process of the
gun, but that bullet isn't coming really
[SPEAKER_00]: impacting anything that's going to deform
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we kind of take that bullet out of
the large or long pool here, if consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: markings does not occur, further visual
comparisons can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question bullet is useless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why you want to have this
non-damaging image occurring to your
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison to allow for all these little
details to be shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're making the match, as we can
kind of see right here, kind of a very
[SPEAKER_00]: detailed look, the distinctive pattern of
pair illustrations are found on the test
[SPEAKER_00]: bullets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the technician can rotate the
evidence bullet slowly and attempt to find
[SPEAKER_00]: a matching pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they kind of take one, they'll have it
fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll take the other one and kind of
rotate it through and see if you can get a
[SPEAKER_00]: match up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This occurs basically through a microscope
at a very detailed level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see just again, here's one example
of all those little details looking
[SPEAKER_00]: through that microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why that comparison microscope in
particular is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if no match is found, no matching
pattern is initially found, the examiner
[SPEAKER_00]: can find other distinctive patterns of
striations on the first bullet and again
[SPEAKER_00]: tries to match the pattern on the second
bullet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not always going to look as super
perfect as like, oh, the whole bullet
[SPEAKER_00]: matches up and all the striations are a
perfect match.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not always the case because there's
inconsistencies with firing.
[SPEAKER_00]: To declare a match with some level of
confidence, there's to be three or more
[SPEAKER_00]: consecutive striations to be found on each
bullet for a match.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denial striations on two bullets must
match.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a common misconception that they
have to be perfect matches and that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Debris in the weapon barrel may have made
stray marks on the bullet within the land
[SPEAKER_00]: impressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two bullets fired the same
semi-automatic pistol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there's other confounding
factors that have to be taken into
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lead to two bullets being fired from
the same gun, but not having exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: identical striation patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving into jacketed and semi-jacketed
bullets, these may not expand sufficiently
[SPEAKER_00]: to fill the grooves of the rifling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's important to consider the type
of bullet that's being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skid marks are marks parallel to the axis
of the bullet made when the bullets
[SPEAKER_00]: initially enters the rifling ridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the surface lands will scrape along the
bullet surface before the bullet is fully
[SPEAKER_00]: gripped by the rifling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The term skid marks are applied to marks
near the nose of the bullet caused by
[SPEAKER_00]: contact with the force of cone,
the barrel of a revolver in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just don't think it's always
going to be those kind of nice striation
[SPEAKER_00]: marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also have these evident skid marks
before that rifling there on the bullet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of details that a bullet
can reveal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have slippage marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So slippage marks are made on the bullet
when it slips along the tops of lands
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of being firmly gripped by the
rifling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result of the barrel being worn or
having been bored out may also result if a
[SPEAKER_00]: sub-calor bullet is fired in a weapon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not come in full contact with
everything to get all those little fine
[SPEAKER_00]: detail markings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slippage marks though are hard to
replicate and test firings, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something to consider or something to look
at as far as what those marks may be if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not getting those full detailed
striations.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the grooves are wider at the
top than at the bottom due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: slippage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it can be kind of a factor to
consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, when you're kind of categorizing
the findings that you may have,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's positive identification,
there's negative identification,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's inconclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Positive IDs, the class characteristics
are consistent with the individual
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics match.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that the likely of the firearm
other than the firearm submitted to the
[SPEAKER_00]: examination to be the questionable is very
unlikely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a positive identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very likely that those two were
fired from the same gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: A negative identification is where the
questionable bullet or cartridge was not
[SPEAKER_00]: fired in the submitted weapon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The class characteristics simply don't
match.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's different than inconclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And inconclusive is where there's simply
too little information to which base the
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusion or that while the class
characteristics match sufficient
[SPEAKER_00]: individual characteristics, declare a
match potentially could not be found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there's three options,
positive, negative, and inconclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important when you declare a
comparison, you know the definitions of
[SPEAKER_00]: these three categories for your findings.
