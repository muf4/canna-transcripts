[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a short video here
because a lot of growers will ask,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, yeah, I check my plants every day,
but what should I be looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a daily grow space checklist and
something just as a good starting point to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great slide to print out here for just
a general idea of what to look for in all
[SPEAKER_00]: the various conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of monitoring is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're monitoring everything,
many different aspects to be checking up
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to operate maximum efficiency when
everything comes together.
[SPEAKER_00]: How all systems go, your plants should
take off just like the shuttle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for air ventilation and circulation,
we want to make sure all the fans are
[SPEAKER_00]: working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the blades and cages clean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially everything starts off nice
and clean, but they tend to accumulate
[SPEAKER_00]: some dust, some other particulates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, make sure you're going
through and turning them off and
[SPEAKER_00]: inspecting them, making sure everything's
clean and working efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidity is going to change based on the
stage of the plant, but just have an idea
[SPEAKER_00]: where the humidity is and are you in this
acceptable range for the various
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether propagation, vegetative or
flowering phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature, looking at daily highs being
between 70, 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can push this to 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going much above 85 though is not advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nighttime temps, it's good to have a
little bit of a cool down, 60 to 65
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also put the Celsius here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moisture is immediately evenly moist
across all plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can depend what media you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might depend on what your soil moisture
level is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're using clay pebbles,
you may want to be aerating that almost 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or seven in hydroponics have their own
parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH for most growing media, we're looking
at a goal of around 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll plant position to the plants need to
be rotated due to light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they kind of leaning over to one side?
[SPEAKER_00]: Insects and disease inspections,
check the tops, the bottoms, the high,
[SPEAKER_00]: low in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also suggested you carry with and
just kind of do a quick cursory look with
[SPEAKER_00]: a loop with an LED light to spot any very
small insects or disease spores at the
[SPEAKER_00]: very early stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients, make sure there's no items
deficiencies and the feeding schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: matches the stage of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little more nitrogen at the beginning to
increase that leaf growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, check the walls on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure everything's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure all the leaves are swept up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintain light distance from the tops of
growing the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raising may be required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind how old the bulbs may be
or the reflectors to ensure that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: still allowing the plants to achieve the
maximum amount of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just a quick little overview
here of all the things to be looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: A kind of run of a checklist to go through
for your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're hitting all these and able to do
this on a daily basis, you should be on
[SPEAKER_00]: your way to an efficient and hopefully
happy growing space for your plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: the grower as well.
Thank you.
Good luck.
