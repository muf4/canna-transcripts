[SPEAKER_00]: Now many growers will tell you it's not
possible to propagate cannabis after it
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you that it is possible,
while it may not be easy, if you do find
[SPEAKER_00]: something truly unique, it is worth at
least taking a shot at propagating even
[SPEAKER_00]: after cannabis plant flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's not ideal that you do this,
but sometimes it's not until you harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: that you realize you want to preserve the
genetics you have in front of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is possible, but it does present
greater challenges, which may reduce your
[SPEAKER_00]: overall success percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, if you are trying this
for the first time and you haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: propagated before, you may want to try to
work on propagation with a normal plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in the vegetative state before you
go through and take on this challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do have that unique individual
that you realize that you do want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: more of and propagate, it is worth at
least a try.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you're going to go about doing this is
you want to start by leaving some
[SPEAKER_00]: underdeveloped lower branches with foliage
on your chosen plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You then want to move that plant to an 18
hour light, 6 hour dark photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may want to supplement with some
nitrogen fertilizers, which can be done
[SPEAKER_00]: the day after harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal here is to try to push that
vegetative growth, push those leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: These odds are if you're harvesting,
you're just coming off a flushing phase
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe, or a reduction in nitrogen or
fertilizers in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to give it a little bit of
that grow fertilizer boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will take about 30 days or so,
the plant should be ready for harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: clones from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes about a month or so after
flowering to kind of get it back in a
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative stage, to kind of get it to
where it's growing again, to where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: able to harvest some vegetative cuttings
from that plant, so you can go through the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire propagation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, while this may not be ideal,
if you do have that unique individual,
[SPEAKER_00]: by all means try it, and I wish you the
best of luck.
