[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over the
correct cordial chemical interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I can't come up with another hard C
here, but this is relating to chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: safety for you in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So step one, protect yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personal protection is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, goggles are required,
but depending on what you're working with,
[SPEAKER_00]: gloves may also be needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lab coats are advised, those working
continually within the lab to limit
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure to chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, can be if you're dealing with
serious cases, as you can see here,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have the PPE, personal protection
equipment, completely sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you'll see scientists using
these lab coats, sometimes gloves are
[SPEAKER_00]: required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on what you're working with,
they don't seem to be happy in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: but depending again, what you're working
with will dictate what you need to wear
[SPEAKER_00]: and those would be covered with you in the
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, thy chemical on the hazmat diamond
can be advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's intended to provide a quick,
universal labeling of materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you may see this on other places as
you're traveling around, this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: diamond shaped key take home message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean after all the details of it,
these four colorations, four, if you see
[SPEAKER_00]: any fours, that's the reason for concern
because of health hazard would be deadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flash points would be very low and
reactivity would be very high here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at, again, different ways
that we can easily look at any chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a general idea what might be in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Areas that have natural gas also have this
because it's potential explosives and it
[SPEAKER_00]: is hazardous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white area may have nothing in it or
it may have these various markers to help
[SPEAKER_00]: identify what might be in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just a quick reference point,
universally accepted and gives you just a
[SPEAKER_00]: good idea of what's in that particular
storage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the chemical, the SDS or the safety
sheet, safety data sheet I should say,
[SPEAKER_00]: these can be found for any chemical
substance, including everyday items.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can look up just about anything on
the internet, look for SDS sheets and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're able to find first aid recommend
for it, firefighting, accidental release,
[SPEAKER_00]: the handling and the storage of that for
just about any product that you do buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Label containers that you use,
so this applies to being in lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're using chemicals in the lab,
be sure to label containers to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a simple marker, you could put a
piece of tape and label it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be clear whether it's
poisonous or concerning or if it's food
[SPEAKER_00]: items.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just having an idea because clear
liquids look like water and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people assume it's water, it could be a
whole host of things or what could be
[SPEAKER_00]: dissolved in that water could clearly make
it fall into one category or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to label that to avoid
confusion and also to avoid mistakes made
[SPEAKER_00]: in the lab for you and the ones around
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know the proper method of disposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for each chemical and resulting
mixtures, know how to properly dispose of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be solid waste, it could be
organic solvents, all of these will be
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly stated at the beginning of lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stress here the chemical and also the
resulting mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you can have two benign
chemicals, chemicals that are pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: unreactive when you mix them that can
create a substance that needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: disposed of in a proper manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the other way, you can have two
sometimes more dangerous chemicals and mix
[SPEAKER_00]: them together and develop a substance that
is not as harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just know how to dispose of it so
you're able to put that in the right area
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're not causing potential
contamination of not only the experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: but groundwater or the sewer system.
[SPEAKER_00]: When in doubt, lastly when in doubt,
just ask, raise your hand, ask a question,
[SPEAKER_00]: look it up, ask the teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always good to when you're in doubt,
just ask the question and be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: direct you in the right way to avoid any
potential mix up or hazards to you or
[SPEAKER_00]: those around you.
