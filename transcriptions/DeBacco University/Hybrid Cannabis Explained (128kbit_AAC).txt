[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video
looking at hybrid cannabis and explaining
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the nuances associated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be a little difficult because
many of the cannabis is actually becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: a hybrid because growers are looking at
blending different traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mansby's blended has got this cat and
bird here, but we're getting this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: blending of indica, sativas, and even
rudalus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just the origin of hybrids just in
general, the goal is to try to obtain the
[SPEAKER_00]: best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often there is a popular demand to combine
the autoflower plant characteristics with
[SPEAKER_00]: another desired cannabinite and or terpene
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why growers are bringing that
rudalus with some of the indicas or
[SPEAKER_00]: sativas whose growers are really looking
for the ease of plant maintenance with
[SPEAKER_00]: also a high quality end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's that kind of nice kind of mixing
of that blue and that yellow to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: green, that kind of merger of two to get
the best of both worlds and to create
[SPEAKER_00]: something new as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hybrid plant morphology,
how do these plants in general look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hybrids can be very variable,
so you want to make sure you're doing your
[SPEAKER_00]: research is highly advised so that you
know what you're getting into.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to start by getting an idea of
this indica or sativa dominant in
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be really tall, whereas it
tends to be shorter and squattier.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will give you that general
classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes the goal by breeders is to take
a standard strain and to breed it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflower into it, but keeping in mind
that other morphological features need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be taken into consideration more than just
it becoming a photo period independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now popular cultivation locations can be
very diverse because with the autoflower
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics, this is a morphology that
fits in many different growing conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: both indoors and outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: With an improved cannabinoid or terpene
content, this makes it very easy selection
[SPEAKER_00]: for a wide varieties of growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, breeders need to continue in this
area and make improvements because while
[SPEAKER_00]: we have the rudalis kind of gene and
autoflower characteristics and we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: our dominant indica sativas with
cannabinoids, the merger of the two,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're still working on ensuring you get
the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now these hybrids might favor one
versus another, so there is still lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: room for improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have tried some of the early
hybrids and weren't really thrilled with
[SPEAKER_00]: them, but there's continual improvements
for this particular type of cultivation of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's hard to kind of pinpoint any one
or couple varieties, but we can see here
[SPEAKER_00]: there's many different ones that fall into
the classification of hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just listed a few here because remember
a lot of growers are breeding in different
[SPEAKER_00]: types, indica sativas, the whole goal is
to get the best of both worlds all in one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant with an established cultivar,
established strain here to help create
[SPEAKER_00]: this ability for growers to produce a high
quality product, but still meet the
[SPEAKER_00]: demands of their particular growing
conditions quite well.
