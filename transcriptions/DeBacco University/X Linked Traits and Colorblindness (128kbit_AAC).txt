[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, looking at X-linked traits and color
blindness, which is directly related to
[SPEAKER_00]: the X chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this X-linked is basically sex-linked
inheritance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inheritance is determined by genes on
the sex chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Females have two copies of the X
chromosome, and the males have one copy of
[SPEAKER_00]: X and one copy of Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why this is important is the X
chromosomes can contain about 2,500 genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: while the puny little Y chromosome only
contains about 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, X-linked genes are only found on the X
chromosome and are typically passed from
[SPEAKER_00]: mothers to sons, never masked or dampered
in males since there's no Y counterpart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we can almost disregard the Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you're a male, you have one X
chromosome, meaning whatever genes you
[SPEAKER_00]: have on that are expressed and evident.
[SPEAKER_00]: The females have two Xs, meaning if
there's a defect in one, they kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: a backup copy, where the males simply do
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why males are more likely to be
color blind than females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this X-linked dominant and recessive
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, males are XY, a single copy of the X
chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Females have two copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Males only get an X chromosome from their
mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Females get an X chromosome from each
parent, both mom and dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of shows it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our two Xs on the female,
our X and our Y from the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, X-linked dominant and recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Males only get X chromosomes from their
mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only place that they can get it,
because dad cannot give two Xs to their
[SPEAKER_00]: daughters, but their sons get one X from
mom and the Y from their dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're looking at our
chromosomes, we look down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's an X and a Y, we know this is the
map for a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this was two Xs, we know this would be
the map for a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Females get the X chromosome from each
parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more likely to show X-linked
dominant disorders, because they have
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially two copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, adherence of an X-linked dominant
mutation from an infected mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: A woman with an X-linked dominant disorder
has 50% chance of having an affected
[SPEAKER_00]: daughter or son with each pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that shows here we have our affected
is the white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the male only has one X and the
puny little Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sons will get that one X from mom,
and their only X from mom, where daughters
[SPEAKER_00]: will get an X from mom and an X from dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as a result, odds are, in this case
here, the affected son and daughters have
[SPEAKER_00]: a 50% chance of having that affected gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for our X-linked dominant,
with the affected father being the case,
[SPEAKER_00]: sons will always be safe, because in this
case, they have to get their X from mom,
[SPEAKER_00]: and mom is unaffected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The daughters, however, they will all be
basically affected by this, because they
[SPEAKER_00]: have to get one of those Xs from dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's a dominant X-linked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will all express that trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's the good and the bad about
X-linked dominant recessive disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example here, just put it into
some colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same basic pattern as before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you just to take a look at these.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pause the video to see if you can
kind of trace and see how this plays out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remembering that females get an X from mom
and dad, males have to get their X from
[SPEAKER_00]: mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, again, shows an X-dominant
affected mother here, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: represented by red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just see how that kind of traces out.
[SPEAKER_00]: X-linked recessive carrier mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, carrier will only have half,
and how that affects both sons and
[SPEAKER_00]: daughters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sons could be unaffected, or sons could be
affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no middle ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, females could be unaffected
or a carrier, in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's get to colorblind, the fun part
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what is colorblindness?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with just the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an admirable condition characterized
by the inability to clearly distinguish
[SPEAKER_00]: different colors from the spectrum,
the ROYGBIV spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Difficultness can be mild to severe,
due to cones located on the retinas.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the back of your eye, you have these
photoreceptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're receptive to color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rods are, see more in just black and
white.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an X chromosome-linked trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we're gonna focus on humans,
but dogs don't have the same cones that we
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, not to disappoint you, but if Fido
there, you have his favorite red toy,
[SPEAKER_00]: his little fire engine or something that's
red, and you're showing him the red color,
[SPEAKER_00]: he can't see the red.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gonna see it as this kind of
grayish-off-yellowish color.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll recognize the shape for you as the
red fire hydrant, but he's not gonna see
[SPEAKER_00]: the red color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you're looking to buy dog toys,
you wanna stick with the blues or the
[SPEAKER_00]: yellows, because that's what they can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green, not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple's also not so great, and reds are
pretty poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just based on the cones that they have in
their eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here to colorblind this, again,
we're looking at X-linked, so carriers,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, will always be female by the
circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Males will either be unaffected or
colorblind, because they only have one X
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, colorblindness, how would this look
worldwide?
[SPEAKER_00]: It affects about one in 12 men,
or one in 200 women.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in total, about four and a half
percent of the world population is
[SPEAKER_00]: colorblind with most being male.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of gives you an idea of the
American flag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one, two, three, four, and five,
and how people with missing different
[SPEAKER_00]: colors would look at the American flag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you are colorblind yourself,
it's not gonna be able to appreciate the
[SPEAKER_00]: differences presented here in some of the
tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this would be a perfect colorblind
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this, by no means, is a medical way
of diagnosing what colorblindness you may
[SPEAKER_00]: or may not have, but you can look at
these, and you should see potentially some
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers in these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some might be easier to tell than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to go through and take a
look at them all and see what you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am gonna reveal the answers,
so if you wanna take a pause, this would
[SPEAKER_00]: be the time to pause it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, for those looking for the answers,
here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed the ones on the bottom here were
squiggling lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a nest of squiggling
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have an easier time seeing
some than the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll flip back for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say that the 12 is really easy
to see up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others, the 42.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some consider this a 71, or is it a 74,
if it's 74.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can just get an idea here of the
answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those playing along, too, at home,
this is another example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you right now, if you're seeing
numbers, you're not in good shape,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be seeing shapes in this one,
particularly animal shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you'd like to, you can pause the
video now before I reveal the answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you're looking to compare the two,
this is what you should see, kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: bear in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an elk with kind of maybe a male in
the foreground, a female in the
[SPEAKER_00]: background, a fox in this region,
kind of a squirrel and a rabbit over here,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to give you an idea what you
potentially should be seeing in that
[SPEAKER_00]: image.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, colorblindness, it's a condition that
affects men more than women, heritage,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic trait, hiring Caucasian males in
any other group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great video here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Explaining and showing a little bit more,
we found right here for some descriptions,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to give you an idea of what causes
colorblindness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And does your red look the same as what I
interpret as red?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your green look the same?
[SPEAKER_00]: Green is most often the color most people
have trouble with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to end here, colors of the
rainbow, give you an idea of, try to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you some examples of some different types
of colorblindness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, colorblindness doesn't mean you
just can't see all the colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different types of colorblindness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on how defective your cones
may be or what mutations may have
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred, affects the amount of colors
that you may be able to see and how your
[SPEAKER_00]: cones in the back of your eye and your
retina interpret the colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, your dog there,
even in the best of vision, he's not
[SPEAKER_00]: technically colorblind.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just lacks the cones to see red,
sees definitely more of the yellows and
[SPEAKER_00]: blues there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this was helpful and you learned
a little bit.
