[SPEAKER_00]: So in this video lecture, we're looking at
the 13 major characteristics of
[SPEAKER_00]: handwriting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stress major characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get down to the details as we see
pictured here, but we're going to get kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of at the broad and look at some examples
of the major characteristics in
[SPEAKER_00]: handwriting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also great to look at your own
handwriting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a statement for comparison is going
to be Jack and Jill went up the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to keep this consistent
through the samples we're going to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: through these 13 different kind of methods
of comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these kind of characteristics that
we're going to be looking at, they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you can stick around and
pause the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's encouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of look and compare to see
what you're looking at for these 13 major
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's start with the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at line quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the letters, are the letters
erratic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they shaky or do they flow?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see an example of smooth,
shaky or nervous or juvenile and or
[SPEAKER_00]: deliberate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just different lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have line qualities to be looking
at the degree of smoothness, shakiness or
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of deliberate writing that the person
may have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have word and letter spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the spacing of the letters?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this example right near me,
we see this kind of generated on a
[SPEAKER_00]: computer form, but is the spacing between
the letters, between the capital letters
[SPEAKER_00]: and the smaller letters, is there a
consistent pattern that we see that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Space between capital letters,
space between word formations.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that spacing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, these are characteristics we're
looking at in someone's handwriting
[SPEAKER_00]: sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a letter comparison as well
as size consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does the ratio of height and width
compare?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they consistent or are they
inconsistent?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's the height of the overall writing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the height of the tall to the short
letters?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there evidence of diminishing strokes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it kind of gets smaller as you go
through or is it increases as you go from
[SPEAKER_00]: left to right here?
[SPEAKER_00]: All things again to be comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking for consistencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at someone's pen lifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the writing continuous or does the
writer lift the writing implement between
[SPEAKER_00]: words?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only between words, but sometimes
between different letters you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often are they picking that pen up and
moving it to the next letter or word?
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can see here, we can see this kind
of joining that's occurring here between
[SPEAKER_00]: the letters of the same word, but there is
a space again between words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will break that kind of
between the capital letter and a lowercase
[SPEAKER_00]: letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely a space there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a pen lift there as we would
call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then connecting strokes or letters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are the capital letters and lowercase
letters connected or continuous or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned before, we can see some of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also pay attention to how the first letter
starts and also how the last letter ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a flare?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a direct line at the end?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have a flourish it's called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there an abrupt ending?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there this kind of stroke to kind of
begin to flourish to start the word?
[SPEAKER_00]: Start the letter I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're looking at kind of where are
their connections?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are their strokes in their letters?
[SPEAKER_00]: Beginning and ending strokes leading to
the page placement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at where do the
letters begin in relation to the space
[SPEAKER_00]: provided on a piece of paper?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if there's no lines that can increase
the variability that you may see,
[SPEAKER_00]: but where does the letter begin on the
page?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they starting at the same point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they starting in the middle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they starting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are they starting?
[SPEAKER_00]: How far are they spacing it from the edge
of the paper that they're writing on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Letter formation, cursive, and or printed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are there any consistencies within
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the letters printed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they written in cursive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a combination of the two so often
it can be seen?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are the letters oriented?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they slant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they angles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they upright?
[SPEAKER_00]: All again factors to be considering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shading and also the pen pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can see this large variability here
as far as is the pressure equal or unequal
[SPEAKER_00]: when applied to the upward and downward
strokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you notice a pattern?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there consistencies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they putting more pressure initially
than lighting up as they're going through
[SPEAKER_00]: writing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because is it the other way around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again these are attention to details that
will allow someone who's analyzing
[SPEAKER_00]: handwriting to be able to pick out some of
these and make comparisons or find
[SPEAKER_00]: similarities that other people may not be
able to find or see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the slant we talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a slant to the writing in
general?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a protractor to determine the
degree if you want to get to that level of
[SPEAKER_00]: specificity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But does it favor the left or the right or
is it variable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again consistencies within the writing are
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baseline habits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does the text relate to the lines
on the paper?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it written?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it above or below the line?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there consistent patterns?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they very key about staying on the
line and having for example the P drop
[SPEAKER_00]: below?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they having some that travel below?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they having some that drift above?
[SPEAKER_00]: All these baseline habits are often
consistent that you may see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flourishes or embellishes that I hinted to
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there additional curls or loops added
to the letters?
[SPEAKER_00]: How fancy is the writing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there certain letters that this
handwriting has consistent flourishes or
[SPEAKER_00]: embellishments on and other letters that
do not have that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again a pattern you might be able to pick
out and notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Placement of the crosses on the T's and
dots on the I's.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as simple as it states here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are the T's crossed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they in the high or the middle or in
the low portion of the T?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are the dots of the I's placed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they left right or are they centered?
[SPEAKER_00]: All things to be kind of considered here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see some extreme examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the dots of the I's a little circle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they a true dot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is that dot placed?
[SPEAKER_00]: The dotting of the I can be quite
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the dot is precise it indicates order
attention and concentration by the author.
[SPEAKER_00]: An I without a dot or a dot incorrectly
drawn indicates a lack of attention by
[SPEAKER_00]: that person or a kind of negligence by the
author.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were they in a rush?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could that play into it as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the crossing of the T's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the characteristics there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When investigating the T, how are the two
main areas?
[SPEAKER_00]: The stem and the T bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several characteristics compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shape of the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Angle of the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on with where it's being
crossed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is that T placed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it on a slant or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again things to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's T bar characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least the height of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it placed on that T bar?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the progress of that T bar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it favoring the left or right side?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the dimensions of the T bar?
[SPEAKER_00]: The directions of the T bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: As simple as writing the word it,
I-T, two letters can really tell a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about someone's handwriting potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly we have the margin formatting.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much empty space is left?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does the writer leave the empty
space on the page?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it consistent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it jagged?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there an angle to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things again to be looking at as
part of all of the factors that go into
[SPEAKER_00]: handwriting analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, it can be quite varied,
but if you kind of break these apart and
[SPEAKER_00]: pick a handwriting, kind of go through all
13, you should be able to find some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these unique characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at your own handwriting,
you might find things that you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: think you were doing all along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
