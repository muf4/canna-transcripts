[SPEAKER_00]: So in this DeBaco University video,
we're going to look at monitoring systems
[SPEAKER_00]: for indoor cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about monitoring systems,
there's a lot of things to monitor in an
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor cannabis production area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to focus more on the growing
environment and not necessarily the
[SPEAKER_00]: security of the site, but I'm sure you'll
find this information useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at some of the
monitoring systems for an indoor cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production environmental area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, data is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do not want to estimate conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having some form of monitoring and or
ideally documenting conditions is
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many options to consider when it
comes to monitoring, but two main
[SPEAKER_00]: categories involve digital data collection
and analog sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers will use the digital systems
as their primary while still having an
[SPEAKER_00]: analog as a backup or a fail safe because
there's some benefits to both systems
[SPEAKER_00]: which we're going to discuss here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off the digital and that's
probably what most growers might be most
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the advantage is why is it so popular?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because it offers precise readouts,
can be preset with minimums and maximums
[SPEAKER_00]: for levels of alarms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also very easy to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy for a multitude of workers
coming through an area to be able to read
[SPEAKER_00]: the data, collect that data and be very
precise about that inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages of that digital
monitoring system is it can fail
[SPEAKER_00]: unexpectedly, more than just a battery is
running out of a pH meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can provide sometimes too much
information or you just get lost in the
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often digital monitoring systems are
more expensive than their analog
[SPEAKER_00]: counterparts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the advantages though to an
analog system is that it's very simplified
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can last for a very long period of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also reliable and less prone to
failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind in growing spaces can be high
humidity, high heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The analogs tend to be a little more
resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: To some of those overall analog monitoring
systems are less expensive compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: digital monitoring systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why aren't analogs always used?
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantages require manual readings
and documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has to go through and write down
those numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not provide exact conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone may look at that and kind of
like determine, oh, is that 54,
[SPEAKER_00]: 55?
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's 53, 53 and a half, 53 and a
quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: May not be precise as some may want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also may need calibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: To ensure that they're operating properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a reason these is again some pros
and cons to each.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, analogs can be used as backup
to the digital ones, but make a decision
[SPEAKER_00]: on which one would you want to have in
your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
