[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're gonna be looking at
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while this image is of a spider mite,
it does look kind of big and dangerous,
[SPEAKER_00]: it actually, these are quite small
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an insect on the leaf surface that
looks like here with the trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can just see how small they actually
are in comparison to the very tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes that do develop on leaf and
other surfaces of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So specifically for spider mites,
when we're looking at the identification
[SPEAKER_00]: of them, they are very small, so this
mites in general tend to be very small
[SPEAKER_00]: insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're often regarded as the most
destructive pest in a grow space because
[SPEAKER_00]: while they may be small, they can mass
multiply and really do a lot of damage
[SPEAKER_00]: that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Webs are more easily seen after a water
mist, so if you have an area that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: recently misting, they do get their first
name is spider, so they do develop these
[SPEAKER_00]: web-like formats.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be very thin structures though,
so difficult to see, but if you do mist
[SPEAKER_00]: the area, they do become quite evident.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, you should be using a 30X
loop that can help you spot them.
[SPEAKER_00]: While able to be seen with the naked eye,
it can be quite a challenge, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: for new growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they extract sap from the plant there,
and that's how they're getting their
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients that they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, where to look for them?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're found on the underside of leaves,
at least at this beginning or onset.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to shy away from the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can progress to covering both sides
of the leaves, so that's an important
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're seeing the tops of leaves,
look at the underside, you'll probably see
[SPEAKER_00]: more of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early damage is often missed by growers,
again, because the mites are so small.
[SPEAKER_00]: The damage they initially do is small,
but that can easily get worse as they
[SPEAKER_00]: progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inspect the leaves for these stipples,
which are tiny, light-colored leaf spots
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be gray to white in coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of looks a little bit here,
we call that stippling of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start by looking at the lower leaves
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inspect the parallel to lead veins on the
underside of the leaves for early
[SPEAKER_00]: detection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are the lead veins?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's kind of the major ones we see
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to occur in pockets with
flowering foot up here, typically
[SPEAKER_00]: encouraging the clustering of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where you find one, you're most likely
gonna find more, and that's why it's
[SPEAKER_00]: important to do thorough inspections,
because if you miss that little pocket,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could think that you're spider
mite-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, again, shows some of the webs,
a little hard to see, but if you miss the
[SPEAKER_00]: area, these become much more evident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how to prevent them?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the webs here for sure,
a little bit harder, again, to see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent spider mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they can be an increased issue if
repeated insecticides are used that remove
[SPEAKER_00]: natural predators in your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful as spider mites can easily be
carried from grow rooms via vectors,
[SPEAKER_00]: and those vectors can be yourself or other
plant material, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning a moving material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even a couple of them can be transported
that way and infect a whole new and clean
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother plants are a most common source for
new mite infections.
[SPEAKER_00]: In removing chickweed, if you're an
outdoor growing operation, because this is
[SPEAKER_00]: a weed host that they can live on and then
jump over to your plant and further infect
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to control them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's some biological control
options, such as predatory mites that can
[SPEAKER_00]: help, but in order to have a chance at
being successful, they need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: established before spider mite populations
get too large.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, you should be mindful this
is an area, or you do have it in one grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room and other rooms are clean at the
moment, you may want to get this
[SPEAKER_00]: biological control started.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do notice them, you can try to
knock down the population maybe as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting for your biological controls to
arrive with insecticidal soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Limit any applications close to harvest
time though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those flower rooms, be very careful you're
adding anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they enter a grow space, the only
truly successful method of control is
[SPEAKER_00]: complete plant removal and disinfection,
and this should be done at harvest time
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're done at that area to kind of
reset that room to zero and keep a careful
[SPEAKER_00]: eye for them so you can catch them early
and hopefully prevent them from getting
infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you're going to be
established in your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
