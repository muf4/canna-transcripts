[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a very brief
introduction to the appendicular skeleton,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm breaking it apart into all
individual pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's only going to focus on the
shoulder girdle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bones of the pectoral girdle,
or the shoulder girdle here, are called
[SPEAKER_00]: the scapula, just the shoulder blade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the clavicle, which you may know as
the collar bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: These bones allow the upper limb to have
exceptionally free movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how they participate in the
skeletal system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now A and B, we should be familiar with
our views of the body and be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our scapula are right posterior view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm not going to make you memorize
all the different parts for at least my
[SPEAKER_00]: class.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bones of the scapula should be
able to orient or highlight where this
[SPEAKER_00]: would be located if we're looking at the
right posterior view of the scapula.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, this is the right
anterior view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, posterior is going to be in
the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's looking at it kind of in this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the anterior view is going to be
looking at this way, and see it's much
[SPEAKER_00]: smoother on this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is that quick overview of the
scapula and the clavicle, the initial
[SPEAKER_00]: start to the lesson on the appendicular
skeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
