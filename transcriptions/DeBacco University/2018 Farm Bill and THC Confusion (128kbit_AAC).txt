[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to tackle looking at the 2018
Farm Bill and the confusion regarding THC
[SPEAKER_00]: and how it is defined within the 2018 Farm
Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what does the Farm Bill
actually state?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the Farm Bill has a definition here,
the term hemp, that means to plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, T to L, and any part of that
plant, including the seeds thereof,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all derivatives, extracts,
cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and salts of isomers, whether growing or
not, with a delta-9 tetracannabidiol,
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, concentration of not more than 0.3%
on a dry weight basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how the 2018 Farm Bill defines
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this makes it seem like only delta-9
THC is of concern until you get to another
[SPEAKER_00]: section, particularly section 297B,
2AII, is read, which causes the confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this main source of confusion
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that kind of refer to?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it specifically states that a
procedure for testing using
[SPEAKER_00]: post-decarboxylation or other similar
reliable methods, delta-9
[SPEAKER_00]: tetracannabidiol, THC again, concentration
levels of hemp produced in the state or
[SPEAKER_00]: territory of the Indian tribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the typical accepted testing
methods?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's two.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the post-decarboxylation,
and then there's high-performance liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's post-decarboxylation turned into
marijuana, and this is looking at that THC
[SPEAKER_00]: A, heating it, and then creating that kind
of delta-9 THC here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that heat is removing that carboxyl
group, essentially that A form of the THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the delta-9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important to kind of make this
distinction of this kind of variant that
[SPEAKER_00]: does occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can take a look at this definition
here of post-decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a process which the acid
cannabinoids, which such as THC A are
[SPEAKER_00]: heated to an active form.
[SPEAKER_00]: This then converts them to a neutral
cannabinoids like THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is that conversion of that THC A
to that delta-9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: To decarboxylate hemp, it needs to be
heated to around 220 degrees Fahrenheit
[SPEAKER_00]: for around 30 to 45 minutes of exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although that time does vary, as you can
kind of see here a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is that decarboxylation step.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is that cannabinoids converting that
THC A to that delta-9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at that high-performance
liquid chromatography, HPLC, formerly
[SPEAKER_00]: referred to as high-pressure liquid
chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, looking at it as a technique in
analytical chemistry used to separate,
[SPEAKER_00]: identify, and quantify each component in a
mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very good at being very precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Realize on pumps to pass pressurized
liquid and solvent containing sample
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture through a column filled with a
solid absorbent material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each component in the sample interacts
slightly differently with the absorbent
[SPEAKER_00]: material, causing different flow rates of
the different components and leading to
[SPEAKER_00]: the separation of those compounds as they
flow through the column.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that ends up creating is like little
peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can think of these peaks being
like kind of a fingerprint signature of
[SPEAKER_00]: what that compound contains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Broken down into very specific kind of
areas there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, where there's a peak, you can
trace that down and have an idea what that
[SPEAKER_00]: compound actually is and what's present
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you run two different liquids,
they'll give you two different peaks,
[SPEAKER_00]: two different signatures there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why does the testing method affect how
the law is interpreted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, both testing methods allow for the
amount of delta-9 THC to be detected.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, HPLC, unlike the decarboxylation
step, does not need to convert the THC A
[SPEAKER_00]: to the delta-9 THC and instead of isolates
of the delta-9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting this slightly different
result here, which is what's leading to
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we interpret the actual farm bill
as the law recommends
[SPEAKER_00]: post-decarboxylation, but also states that
hemp is defined as under 0.3% delta-9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that kind of controversy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because this has led to the individual
states to determine what the law means,
[SPEAKER_00]: and is somewhat contradictory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's being defined as under that
delta-9 THC, but is that the total THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there some interpretation going on
in the state basis, depending on what step
[SPEAKER_00]: or what kind of process they're using as
far as what THC are they exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: calculating?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will sadly continue to be
confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the USDA has not developed a standard
test for determining the delta-9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we saw here, the decarboxylation
and the HPLC do yield slightly different
[SPEAKER_00]: results there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until the test has been developed,
there will continue to be confusion
[SPEAKER_00]: between states and the federal law,
unless further clarification from the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal government is given.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know this can be a little bit
confusing, but hopefully this provide with
[SPEAKER_00]: some detail or some of the science behind
the reason for the confusion and the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential different interpretation of the
2018 farm bill defining hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
