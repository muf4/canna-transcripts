[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm going to go over some diseases
of concern if you're growing squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've included kind of a little list here
of some very common ones as well as some
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures I've taken in the field to try to
give you what these diseases actually look
[SPEAKER_00]: like in farm fields to give you that way
to compare if you're seeing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first one, let's start with this
powdery mildew, a very obvious one if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: These fuzzy white spots that typically
occur in the underside of leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: shadier areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part when you're trying to control
this is to try to increase air circulation
[SPEAKER_00]: and also apply products at regular
intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you want to start at the very onset of
this disease which if you haven't seen it
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're scouting and you're into that
first week of August in southern New
[SPEAKER_00]: England, probably want to start your
applications then anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: This picture here I've taken in the field
where you can obviously see the powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is evidence of a grower who's been
making spray applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you'll see the center portion of this
leaf here where spray products
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly organic ones that work on
contact only will collect you don't see a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the areas where the leaves curl up you
see a lot more higher evidence of these
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is evidence of a grower who's been
spraying and making regular applications
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a good thing even though you do
see powdery keeping up those regular
[SPEAKER_00]: applications is advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now downy mildew is a much more severe
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces these yellow lesions on the
surface and the underside will kind of be
[SPEAKER_00]: this gray and a tan fuzziness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what makes this worse than powdery is
powdery lives on the surface of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Downy is an internal disease so planting
resistant varieties and planting early in
[SPEAKER_00]: the season can help you get by potential
late season downy mildew threats because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where it's more common to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cucumbers get all the different strains of
downy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other subsets which in the squash category
such as watermelons and pumpkins they are
[SPEAKER_00]: not susceptible necessarily to all of the
six strains of downy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organically there's not a lot of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemically you're looking at systemic like
a phosphate and if you make an application
[SPEAKER_00]: and it progresses after about three days
you want to make an application with a
[SPEAKER_00]: different chemistry and if that doesn't
work then you may lose the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep an eye on watching downy mildew
trackers and talking with growers in your
[SPEAKER_00]: area if this is coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plectisporium produces these white diamond
shape legions on the pedigals of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can progress to the stems and also the
fruit itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually not that much you can do
organically for spraying copper products
[SPEAKER_00]: that can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: For chemical Bravo chlorothidyl product to
be the best option.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is nice growing on this fabric here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It prevents weeds and allows for a clean
harvest of the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fusarium what to look for here is wilting
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vines and leaf stalks will rot and if
the vines are cut ahead of the rot
[SPEAKER_00]: internal veins you can look for that
orange kind of tan colorations you kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: see developed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to rotate your squash plantings
with monocots or grass species to help
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce this problem and also don't over
irrigate or over apply nitrogen as both of
[SPEAKER_00]: those will encourage Fusarium to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacteria wilt is the wilting of the leaves
as the name implies and the leaves may
[SPEAKER_00]: return to normal in times of low light
such as right around sunrise or just
[SPEAKER_00]: before the sun completely sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to prevent cucumber beetle
feeding when this occurs because that is
[SPEAKER_00]: the main vector for this and the control
is harvest what you can and then pull that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant out so that other cucumber beetles
don't feed on that infected plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick up more of the bacteria and spread it
to your other plantings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Angular leaf spot you see here these
images are brown lesions on the leaf that
[SPEAKER_00]: follow the leaf vein causing that kind of
angular look to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this can be seed borne but it's also
spread by overhead irrigation and if you
[SPEAKER_00]: catch it early copper applications can
slow its spread and progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacteria spot is the last one I want to
talk about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to look for small but numerous
circular lesions on the leaves and also it
[SPEAKER_00]: can appear on the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not all that common but high heat and
moisture can increase its spread and
[SPEAKER_00]: copper applications would be advised
because fungicides will not work because
[SPEAKER_00]: keep in mind this is a bacterial disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
