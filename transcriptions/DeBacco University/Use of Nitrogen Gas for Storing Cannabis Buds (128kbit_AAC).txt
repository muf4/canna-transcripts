[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for a professional way
to store your cannabis buds, the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen gas can be a great way to go
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here on DeBaco University,
we're going to cover just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the use of
nitrogen gas for storing cannabis buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, the obvious question
should be, well, why use nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already 78% of the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a colorless or odorless gas and
heavier than oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would we utilize that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, nitrogen has actually been used for
years in preservation of perishables
[SPEAKER_00]: during transport and storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably most notable for the meat
industry, it's why things come in nice
[SPEAKER_00]: sealed containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These containers will be sealed and
nitrogen gas will be added to that
[SPEAKER_00]: environment to help preserve that meat as
long as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nitrogen advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at nitrogen,
the gas flush sealed Mylar bags are
[SPEAKER_00]: excellent packaging for long-term storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process flushes the bag with nitrogen
and then seals it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purging bag packages of oxygen extends the
life of the buds and prevents growth of
[SPEAKER_00]: mold and discoloration similar to that of
vacuum sealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some testing labs offer nitrogen bagging
services using tamper-proof packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this nitrogen sealing technology are
really great for that really long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: storage and preservation of maintaining
that high quality over an extended period
[SPEAKER_00]: of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen is being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've probably had a bag of potato
chips and actually it's been sealed with
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potato chips are shipped in
nitrogen-filled bags that not only help
[SPEAKER_00]: with the preservation but limit damage
during shipping and transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you try to push on a potato chip
bag, there's a lot of air in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that air is usually higher
percentage nitrogen than the normal
[SPEAKER_00]: atmospheric conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps keep all the chips from
breaking and helps keep a long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: storage because that nitrogen does help
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same concept can be applied to
your cannabis buds, prevent the physical
[SPEAKER_00]: damage of the buds as well as preserving
the long-term storage by the use of higher
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations of nitrogen in this storage
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that nitrogen saturation advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sealing up containers with nitrogen
gas can reduce the oxidation and help
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve the cannabinoids as well as the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's limiting that kind of breaking
down process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as we saw, it could be in mylar bags,
could also be in kind of what looks like a
[SPEAKER_00]: cat food or tuna fish container here as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This aluminum can, both can have nitrogen
saturation applied to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be just one set system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is however added cost to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is at cost with this nitrogen gas
option, but consumers may not see a great
[SPEAKER_00]: value with this, unlike the quality curing
and trimming of buds that they will notice
[SPEAKER_00]: and may be willing to pay a little bit
more for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is advised the use of nitrogen
gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should incorporate only high quality
end product to ensure only the best
[SPEAKER_00]: material has the longest shelf life and
something you're going to hopefully get a
[SPEAKER_00]: near top dollar for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind that use of nitrogen gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget about the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Storing cannabis in nitrogen does have its
advantages as presented here, but light
[SPEAKER_00]: can still degrade the bud quality even if
nitrogen is used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think just because you're using this
nitrogen gas saturation that now you can
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them all out in the light and they
won't be affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still can be broken down by other
environmental factors, but utilizing the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen gas can help preserve the local
environment those buds are kept for the
[SPEAKER_00]: longest storage option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're able to maintain that high
quality for as long as possible.
