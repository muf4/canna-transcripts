[SPEAKER_00]: Here on Tobacco University, I'm going to
go over water purification options for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: When growing cannabis due to tight
standards and often regulations,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to make sure everything is clean
and consistent as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water purification is an important part
of this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the options when it
comes to purifying your water?
[SPEAKER_00]: So purification slash filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This purification process is removing
undesirable chemicals, biological
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminants, suspended solids,
and gases from water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a variety of methods that can be
used which is dependent on the initial
[SPEAKER_00]: water conditions and what the target
substance is to be removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So choosing your options first determines
what do you potentially want to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: targeting when you're looking at removing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water volume versus water quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at the two here,
growers need to have a water purification
[SPEAKER_00]: system that will supply enough volume of
water for the amount of plants they intend
[SPEAKER_00]: on growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, depending on the type of water
that is initially incoming into the
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, this can impact the type of
water purification system used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes to get the proper quality of
water takes time and can reduce volume be
[SPEAKER_00]: produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here with kind of a distillation
system, they pour water in, they capture
[SPEAKER_00]: it with a dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great if you only need to water
with this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in many other cases, you need a
lot more volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can you ensure you have a good
quality while still maintaining the right
[SPEAKER_00]: volume?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's under what's required by the
plants, there's going to be issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have stress issues with
simply lack of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, growers need to factor in the volume
of their plants will consume on a hot day
[SPEAKER_00]: at full maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be able to get by its
propagation stage, but at maturity,
[SPEAKER_00]: hot day, can you supply enough water with
your chosen purification system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers have to deal with hard water
or soft water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the difference between these
two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for hard water, this has high
content of dissolved minerals,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is hard, which make it primarily
high in calcium and magnesium content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's measured in milligrams of calcium
salts per liter of water, typically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we can see here, 200 to 400 is in
the range of hard water, while 400 to 450
[SPEAKER_00]: is considered to be very hard water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typical tap water is in that 170 to 190
milligrams per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while this is not dangerous to humans,
consuming this type of water can
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially be harmful to cannabis,
and especially for mixing it with other
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soft water contains little minerals to
none at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under 150 is considered very soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: 150 to 200 is just simply soft water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rainwater, purified, ionized, and
distilled water are examples of soft
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: With rainwater, once it collects soil
particles and minerals, the hardness scale
[SPEAKER_00]: can go up, so be mindful of where you're
collecting potentially that rainwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a general comparison between
hard and soft water, a little definition,
[SPEAKER_00]: formation, ions, and effect are presented
here if you want more details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now getting into some specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is reverse osmosis, and this
essentially produces pure water with an
[SPEAKER_00]: electro-connectivity of zero in zero parts
per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very pure system.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantage of this system,
while you think it could be wrong with it
[SPEAKER_00]: producing zero EC or zero parts per
million, it's a very slow process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also generates a waste water that's not
harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not used, it needs to be
disposed of, or have a drain associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in this system, the membranes need to
be replaced to prevent micro-contamination
[SPEAKER_00]: of the water over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tap water is easy, comes directly out of
the tap, typically also called city water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage of tap water is it can
have potential contaminants in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it may restrict what nutrients growers can
add.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talk about contaminants,
we're not talking about necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that's harmful, just potential
for like chlorine, or other minerals that
[SPEAKER_00]: may make it more limiting on the amount of
nutrients that a grower can add to that
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have a carbon filtration system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage is we remove chlorine,
volatile organic compounds called VOCs,
[SPEAKER_00]: taste and odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can also remove sediment, but this will
reduce the filter's useful life
[SPEAKER_00]: expectancy, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is it does not remove
minerals, salts, or dissolved organic
[SPEAKER_00]: substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that comes back to what are you
trying to remove from your water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a good fit for what you have as a
quote contaminant in your water?
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, we have a sediment filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this removes physical particles from
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often used as a pre-filter before
other filtration methods to simply
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the longevity of the other
filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall of the sediment filter is it
only removes particles and not chemicals
[SPEAKER_00]: or contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The finer the screen that the sediment
filter has, typically the slower rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might be important when you're
doing calculations to make sure you can
[SPEAKER_00]: supply your plants with enough flow while
also delivering the right quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need any more information on these
types of filtration, search Tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: University here to learn more about each.
