[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another DeBaco University video
lecture production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be investigating
cannabis indica and explaining some of its
[SPEAKER_00]: unique properties and kind of what defines
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking just at the image here we can see
that the leaf structure, the morphology,
[SPEAKER_00]: is really how we classify an indica versus
sativa versus some of the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here this indica is a much shorter and
wider leaf compared to other sativas which
[SPEAKER_00]: have a longer and thinner leaf style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in addition, indicas are generally
agreed to originate on the Asian
[SPEAKER_00]: subcontinent, possibly in the Afghanistan
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of look in this general region of
the world right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether cannabis indica and cannabis
sativa are truly separate species is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually a matter of debate and some
controversy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since its classification is based on
morphology, the general plant behavior is
[SPEAKER_00]: what is being compared here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at the indicas having
certain morphologies or certain physical
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the indica plant morphology,
so what are those physical
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this plant actually look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the height is small growing usually
one to six feet in height and the
[SPEAKER_00]: internode spacing is typically three
inches or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaf morphology tends to be a very
wide appearance as we can clearly see in
[SPEAKER_00]: this image here and also in this plant as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves tend to be a little bit more a
darker shade of green again comparing them
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit more to the more traditional
sativas for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to have more side branching than
sativas resulting in a wider bushier plant
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, this will cause denser plants
overall in their general structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Popular cultivation locations for our
indicas here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, they're kind of that kind of
in-between, like Goldilocks plant
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology compared to others.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, it increases the flexibility
of locations that it can be used
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great for growers looking to have a quick
turnovers between growing cycles,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they don't get quite as tall and quite
take up the area the sativa would.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, indicas are still photoperiod
dependent, so outdoor plantings be aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: The timing is also important because they
get shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be mindful of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to plant them too late in
the season because they might get flipped
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower a little bit sooner and even
stunt them further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in general, there are many indica
cultivars that exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Lights is among the most famous
strain of all time and it's also a pure
[SPEAKER_00]: indica for just a general sense of
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Bubba Kush as another example.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these are going to have that shorter
kind of plant morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at one of the leaves,
it's going to be more of that short and
[SPEAKER_00]: wider kind of appearance there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you some idea of what defines
morphologically a cannabis indica plant.
