[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to learn about some
problems of the nervous system that you
[SPEAKER_00]: either may have sadly been familiar with
yourself or know someone that may have had
[SPEAKER_00]: one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of occurs when the nervous
system doesn't work 100% right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the first one,
very common for people playing sports are
[SPEAKER_00]: concussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a temporary disturbance of the
brain's ability to function due to a hard
[SPEAKER_00]: blow to the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's happening here is in this case
we have the head reaching a hard object
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this traumatic brain injury changes
the way the brain functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This soft tissue that the brain is made of
causing the brain to jolt forward
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately causes a shift in the brain and
can cause injury to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this injury could be very minimal
bruising or very minimal swelling,
[SPEAKER_00]: tearing of blood vessels, but if it's
really intense this can lead to greater
[SPEAKER_00]: and greater concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most concussions are mild and can be
treated with appropriate care.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's a severe concussion,
this is why there's concussions protocols
[SPEAKER_00]: in a lot of sporting events now,
if it's a severe concussion it can cause
[SPEAKER_00]: longer-term effects if left untreated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the games that are associated with
concussions in particular is football as
[SPEAKER_00]: being number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows football leads the way in high
school concussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other sports pose risk as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Below are the rates of concussions per
athlete per hundred thousand games and
[SPEAKER_00]: practices nationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So football is the highest boys hockey
Boys ice hockey is the next highest,
[SPEAKER_00]: followed by boys lacrosse, followed by
girls lacrosse, girls soccer, boys
[SPEAKER_00]: wrestling, and girls field hockey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Football is typically such high,
it's a very contact-oriented sport and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of that abrupt stopping here
through tackling that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result they've tried to design
helmets and put protocols in place to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the occurrence and the impact of
concussions have on players.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paralysis is another form, it's a loss of
sensation and movement of part of the body
[SPEAKER_00]: due to an injury the spinal cord or brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping in mind the higher the damage
occurs on the spinal cord, the greater
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of impact it will have on the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's lower in the spinal cord here,
lower parts of the body will be affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher occurs in the spinal cord,
you can think about it from that point on
[SPEAKER_00]: south is where the paralysis could occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why especially for car accidents
when I maintain especially this upper
[SPEAKER_00]: portion is intact as possible because the
higher up that damage occurs, the more of
[SPEAKER_00]: that body that will be affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parkinson's disease is when the brain
doesn't produce enough of the
[SPEAKER_00]: neurotransmitter that transmits messages
from the brain to muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So symptoms are tremors, rigid muscles,
shuffle walking, and loss of facial
[SPEAKER_00]: expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here a healthy brain and a Parkinson's
slightly infected brain, we see the
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in the amount of
neurotransmitters being produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping in mind a normal neuron would
produce this many aligned for normal
[SPEAKER_00]: movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a person affected with Parkinson's
disease and we see our dopamine produces
[SPEAKER_00]: much reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though the number of receptors are
the same, simply having reduced amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: dopamine reduces the amount of receiving
of that signal causing a poor movement of
[SPEAKER_00]: that person's muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on we have Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a gradual shrinking of the neurons
in the cerebrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can cause memory loss, emotional
disturbances, inability to function on its
[SPEAKER_00]: own, and ultimately sadly death.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body simply does not being able to
make those necessary connections to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce vital bodily functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epilepsy is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an abrupt transmission of a
message between the neurons and the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, an admirable transmission of
messages between the neurons and the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be abrupt in the sense that a
seizure could occur in part or the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a partial seizure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is normal EEG levels, normal brain
activity, and the partial seizures that
[SPEAKER_00]: increased them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A generalized seizure or grand models
where the whole brain kind of goes through
[SPEAKER_00]: this and we see massive elevated signal
levels throughout the entire brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be called epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, at least that we're going to
discuss here, are multiple sclerosis or
[SPEAKER_00]: Tay-Sachs disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: These both result from indeed generation
of the myelin sheath located in neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these myelin sheaths offer protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice that as this electricity transfers
here, not having protected, the signal
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of dies out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here the signal's being able to jump and
move a lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: This breakdown of the myelin sheaths is
what's reducing the signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reducing that signal is causing all sorts
of potential symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be it everything from cognitive impairment
to simple pain, to not having our organs
[SPEAKER_00]: function properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this is because of a loss of the
neuron's ability to transfer signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
