[SPEAKER_00]: This DeBaco University video is going to
look at the Entourage Effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those that watch this video in its
entirety may spark some interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation in the comments below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's talk about the Entourage
Effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason I have this image here is we
see a picture of two faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's kind of like one image is made
up a bunch of other smaller images.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what the Entourage Effect
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of small little things that come
together that create a larger picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at this from a scientific
viewpoint, particularly with the Entourage
[SPEAKER_00]: Effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This article does get cited quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good one to kind of take a look
at and maybe kind of research it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the proper citation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the article for yourself there
would be advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Entourage Effect, what's the
concept of the Entourage Effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: just in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: The term Entourage Effect was coined by
Israeli researcher Dr. Rafael Mukulam to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain how a combination of cannabis
compounds is more effective than an
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the idea that we have a bunch of
these different compounds all coming
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sum is greater than any individual
parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently the term is used to describe the
way photocannabinoids, terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and other cannabis compounds work together
cooperatively as opposed to one type of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid leading the charge while the
rest follow is the World Entourage Effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not quite perfect use of the term,
but the idea that the sum of all these
[SPEAKER_00]: parts is a greater effect than any
individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis and the Entourage Effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis contains hundreds of molecules
that have the ability to interact with our
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies and minds, general categories,
cannabinoids, flavonoids, and terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: just in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these cannabis derived molecules
work synergistically with one another,
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially enhancing the most desirable
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why people are looking at
researching, determining what combination
[SPEAKER_00]: might be the best or what ratios might be
the best for specific effects all related
[SPEAKER_00]: to this Entourage Effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabinoids and terpenes, well kind of
in the image presented right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes may support or enhance the
therapeutic potency of cannabinoids such
[SPEAKER_00]: as THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: This potential relationship between the
cannabinoids and compounds is known as the
[SPEAKER_00]: Entourage or the Assemble Effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes have the capacity to modulate the
way THC and CBD will bind to CB1 and CB2
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors in their own therapeutic
effects, which are synergistic with the
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have these kind of like combination
of the two, creating that Entourage Effect
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBD and THC interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, CB has displayed an unusual ability
to antagonize CB1 at very low nanomolar
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically very, very small
concentrations in the presence of THC
[SPEAKER_00]: despite having little binding affinity,
which is a fundamental example of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Entourage Effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This suggests that even in the presence of
small amounts of THC, the binding
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for CBD becomes greatly
increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you have that kind of
combination of the two being greater than
[SPEAKER_00]: any single part.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to Rousseau, this supports CBD's
modality effect on THC association adverse
[SPEAKER_00]: events such as anxiety, tachycardia,
hunger, sedation, and rats in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a definite correlation between
CBD and the effect of THC has not been
[SPEAKER_00]: established.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're seeing this potential of
this interaction between these different
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's the relationship between THC
and CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is one example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at this kind of
extract, neboximolis, probably
[SPEAKER_00]: mispronouncing that, are CBD and THC
extracts administered in clinical settings
[SPEAKER_00]: as an oral spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CBD proved to be a critical factor in
the ability to treat pain in cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: patients who were unresponsive to opioids
as a high THC extract devoid of CBD failed
[SPEAKER_00]: to distinguish from placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a certain modular relationship
between THC and CBD and most likely other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid types in families.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this means is basically they
needed to have both of these a combination
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the desired effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just applying one or the other did not get
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was that synergistic kind of
combination of the two in this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: study that caused the desired effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of what most people
associate and correlate with the entourage
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we have to keep an open mind in
that there is this scientific American
[SPEAKER_00]: article published that basically states
some of all these parts is marijuana's
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage effect scientifically valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of an interesting article
you're welcome to take a look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll explain it a little bit more here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stated that industrial players swear
pots, many chemicals work in concert,
[SPEAKER_00]: but most scientists hear a THC solo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was published on April 20th of
2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a little weird as it was presented
on 420 on 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk is cheap here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're looking at just in general,
the lay public has really taken on the
[SPEAKER_00]: notion of the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's not a lot of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a neurobiologist at Columbia
University and cannabis researcher here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of give the example here of like
talk is cheap and just because you hear it
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of times, is it actually true or
is it actually fact?
[SPEAKER_00]: So counterpoint to the previous article.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that previous article that I
highlighted is right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is kind of a counteraction to
that previous article.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sense that the entourage effect gained
some ground in 2011 when Russo published a
[SPEAKER_00]: paper in a British journal of pharmacology
reviewing the potential interactions
[SPEAKER_00]: between THC and various cannabinoids and
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the first article I
highlighted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at the counterpoint,
which is the article here published by
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientific American.
[SPEAKER_00]: So neurochemical actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-THC cannabinoids do have some
neurological actions as they can affect,
[SPEAKER_00]: often in different ways, cannabinoid
receptors in the central nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most commonly cited examples are
cannabidiol or CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are seeing that CBD does have some
direct ways that it alone can cause
[SPEAKER_00]: alterations with neurotransmitters and
receptors and have an impact on the
[SPEAKER_00]: neurochemical pathways of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan Russo, another researcher pictured
here in about 40% of people, about 10
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams of THC can potentially cause
toxic psychosis or THC induced psychotic
[SPEAKER_00]: like symptoms such as delusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 10 milligrams, about 40% of people will
have that reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since TVEX, a multiple sclerosis
medication is not approved in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States, has equal amounts of THC in CBD
and at amounts of 48 milligrams,
[SPEAKER_00]: so 4.8 times greater than here,
of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: In their study, only four patients out of
250 exposed, about 1.6 people,
[SPEAKER_00]: had this toxic psychosis there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very important demonstration
of this synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC alone is a poor drug and a very poor
therapeutic index, but in combination,
[SPEAKER_00]: there can be some potential or greater
benefits therapeutically with reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for delusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So show me the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the data showing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we kind of looking at here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, there's no hard evidence that the
entourage effect is actually real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that statement will come as a shock
to a lot of people, and I'm sure I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: already getting comments within this
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: But double-blind clinical trials are the
gold standard for research studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, we're talking about these
double-blind studies, these clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's phase one, phase two, phase three,
and phase four trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at seeking FDA approval in
this example, but basically we're having
[SPEAKER_00]: more people tested for validity of any
statement or any drug that's being brought
[SPEAKER_00]: to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anecdotes are not data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Holmes says that he does not like the
fact that the entourage effect supporters'
[SPEAKER_00]: best evidence lies in anecdotes,
but he thinks they still tell an important
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because studies have not been carried out,
but you have thousands and thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: people reporting the same thing,
it gets hard to ignore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that it's not necessarily
not true, for those that have made it this
[SPEAKER_00]: far in the video, but we're basing really
entourage effects mostly in this category,
[SPEAKER_00]: the anecdotes, than the actual clinical
trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Studies are difficult because currently
being a schedule one status of the drug,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting research licenses out of reach of
many scientists, making it hard to conduct
[SPEAKER_00]: those clinical trials at the current time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about edibles?
[SPEAKER_00]: To another important consideration,
edibles lack terpenes since they're
[SPEAKER_00]: volatile compounds and edibles need to go
through a heating process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also reported to have effects with
basically no terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are they going about showing
positive medical potential effects for
[SPEAKER_00]: patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be true, but I always give the
question there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says that marijuana may actually have
the entourage effect, but it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible to know without more
information, such as strange comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not saying it's not true,
we're just saying that right now don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really have great scientific evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of on the weak side,
opinions, anecdotes, maybe some initial
[SPEAKER_00]: lab studies can be conducted, as there are
some studies in some humans, randomized
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled trials, all began to the metal
analysis or systemic review.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very strong evidence, this is very
weak evidence, and sadly the entourage
[SPEAKER_00]: effect falls closer to that weaker than
the stronger side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also have to consider the placebo
effect, this is kind of our last little
[SPEAKER_00]: statement here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The placebo effect is very powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you believe smoking a bud will give you
a bright cerebral experience, spilling
[SPEAKER_00]: with creativity, or that a THC pill will
make you anxious and paranoid,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that is what you are probably going
to feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the example here of one person
taking a drug, one person taking a
[SPEAKER_00]: placebo, there's no drug, and basically
getting the same result because they feel
[SPEAKER_00]: they're taking the drug, so they're
getting the anticipated effects there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a little bit of complication
added here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with our entourage effect, not saying
it's not real, we just need to realize
[SPEAKER_00]: that right now there's not some great
scientific studies really in support of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, not saying those won't come in the
future, and that's great about science and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully the future of research,
but right now we don't have any great
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific studies, but hopefully that
will change going forward.
