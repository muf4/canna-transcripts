[SPEAKER_00]: Here in this DeBacco University video,
if you're looking at growing a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: field and managing your weeds by mowing,
this video will provide you with some
[SPEAKER_00]: specifics and some ideas to consider so
you maintain, hopefully, a weed-free field
[SPEAKER_00]: and increase your production.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into mowing to manage
weeds in a cannabis field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, you want to plant before
mowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while some growers will simply mow the
weeds to make this method more effective,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll plant a cover crop in rows at the
time of planting the main crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see here, while this isn't
cannabis, this is a squash and pumpkin
[SPEAKER_00]: field, here we see a lot of grass being
planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can be a grass and clover mix is
very common because it's easy to establish
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil and also limits the potential
for erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also provides a great cover crop to
be easily mowed before the vines in this
[SPEAKER_00]: case start to crawl over the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just want to just mow the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're intentionally planting
cover crop in between our rows and then
[SPEAKER_00]: mowing that cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that requires established rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're seeing grapevines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing buckwheat planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having established rows can help be
helpful in defining the areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be used from year to year,
particularly with these more perennial
[SPEAKER_00]: crops here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buckwheat, great here at maintaining the
soil, grows really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It attracts pollinators, a lot of
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's planted in this
consistent row, it's going to allow mowing
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a very effective method of control
and also of managing this particular area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to establishing those
rows, we want to be mindful of the row
[SPEAKER_00]: spacing that we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rows should be spaced to allow the
mowing equipment you'll be using an easy
[SPEAKER_00]: pass or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just going to be one pass down the
row, maybe one pass down, turn around and
[SPEAKER_00]: come back the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This needs to be established early in the
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be thinking long-term, to save you time
in season.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do something that's like a
pass and a half or three passes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to try to match it to whatever
equipment that you're using to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: easy for you to go through and manage that
particular area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, when we're relating this to
cannabis production, selecting a low
[SPEAKER_00]: growing cover crop or even a turf grass
species can be preferable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will allow easier mowing and help
limit soil erosion, both good things to be
[SPEAKER_00]: considering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding a clover species, as we see here,
can also help encourage nitrogen fixation
[SPEAKER_00]: in between the rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while this will not benefit your
in-row crop, it can help the general soil
[SPEAKER_00]: biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do rotate in the field at a
later date, it will help future plantings
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with anything, we always want to be
thinking long-term to treat our soil well,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we treat the soil well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have our plants be very productive
and allow us long-term production,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will be good for the environment as
well as our total yield.
