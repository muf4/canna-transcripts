[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at some vegetative or
grown nutrients here on this Tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: University video, we've read you just kind
of an example and go through some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers you might be considering.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into vegetative or
grown nutrient evaluation for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind that I'm not sponsored by
any of these companies, but these are just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a general review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanicare, very common name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Botanicare Pure Blend Pro Grow 3-2-4
Fertilizer Blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essential elements are not derived from
urea or ammonium nitrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something to take into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organic components of Pure Blend Pro
enhance uptake and utilization of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, at least according to the
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: An amplified metabolic rate and capacity
enables plants to produce fruits and
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables with more minerals and
vitamins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, another statement from the company
here, but this is a very common grow
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient blend that many growers may
choose to utilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there is also the general
organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a general hydroponics,
I should say, floral nutrient 7-4-10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be aware of the high potassium ratio in
this fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're fertilizing for the grow in
particular, you're going to be looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the nitrogen number and that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind this all has a relatively
high potassium number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take that into consideration when
you're going through and fertilizing your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have Fox Farm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Fox Farm Grow Big Liquid
Concentrate, a 6-4-4 blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the actual recommendations are all
stated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: General feeding, heavy feeding,
and foliar feeding as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind if you are going to do foliar
feeding with any fertilizer, not just this
[SPEAKER_00]: one, you want to apply it to both sides of
the leaves and you don't want to apply it
[SPEAKER_00]: to plants that are in direct sunlight
because that could increase the chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have our general feeding of two
to three teaspoons, heavy feeding of four
[SPEAKER_00]: teaspoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, generally follow the recommended
recommendations don't go above because
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding your plants more will not
necessarily make them grow any better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have NPK Industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get their name from the nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium listed in
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a raw veg A, a raw veg B,
we can see different ratios listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a feeding schedule here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these products are water soluble
forms, meaning they're a powder that
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll add to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the company recommends equal parts,
realize there are concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: differences in these fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage is you can potentially make
modifications to match your particular
[SPEAKER_00]: growing situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, we have Advanced
Nutrients, which specifically targets the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry in their marketing and
kind of all their research.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a great focus on pH balanced
nutrient lines, particularly for
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponic production.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, keep in mind with Advanced
Nutrients, the products often carry a
[SPEAKER_00]: premium cost compared to other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, take that into consideration
that when you're looking at applying
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, you want to be also concerned
about the cost that you're going to incur
[SPEAKER_00]: for the plants that you'll be fertilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this gives you just a couple of
companies to kind of look at or consider
[SPEAKER_00]: or compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not sponsored by anyone,
but just here to provide you with a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of some ideas for nutrients you might
want to consider during the vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle of your plants.
