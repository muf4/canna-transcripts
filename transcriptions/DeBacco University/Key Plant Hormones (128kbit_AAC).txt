[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this tobacco university video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go over key plant hormones
and give you kind of a quick general
[SPEAKER_00]: summary of many of the hormones that
impact plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into those key plant
hormones here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, once you understand that
there's many plant hormones, there's not
[SPEAKER_00]: just one, there's not just two,
and even within the couple categories,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's multiple that may fall under that
same category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's many different plant hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the main categories of plant
hormones will be covered and provided in a
[SPEAKER_00]: general overview, but I just want you to
realize that just under gibberellins,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's this one plant hormone,
typically abbreviated GAs, there's over
[SPEAKER_00]: 120 identified, somewhat different kind of
effects on the plants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're at least kind of commonly named
with GA1, GA2, GA3, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So realize that within gibberellins,
there is 120 just under that one,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they can have everything from
enhancing calcium, phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium content, to promoting seed
germination, to stimulating stem and root
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of different studies with a lot
of different hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, also the interaction with all these
hormones, that can get very confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried to write a little couple
summary charts here, where we can see some
[SPEAKER_00]: have inhibitory effects on others,
some block others, some also kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: promote others or work synergistically
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of get all these crazy kind of
interactions that may occur, so this can
[SPEAKER_00]: get confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not gonna spend a ton of time on all the
complexities, once you realize that there
[SPEAKER_00]: is a lot at play here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna focus on just the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically also when we have our
hormones, a series of steps and pathways
[SPEAKER_00]: are involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see with tricantinol,
what does it cause?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it can cause greater dry weight and
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it kind of accomplish that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can see there's secondary
messengers, there's enzymes involved,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some metabolism changes in effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this kind of cascading effect that
while we have one thing that creates one
[SPEAKER_00]: result, it goes about it in many different
pathways and it impacts many different
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of these kind of plant
hormones?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what's a general summary?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the key ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins,
abscisic acid and ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a great kind of slide to
pause and kind of go through some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, each of these are covered on
separate videos here on tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: university.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good to kind of type that name in the
search within the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find some of these so you can learn a
little bit more about what the main
[SPEAKER_00]: highlight is for each of these five main
hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's also more hormones that
will be covered and we can see a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are kind of like also,
you know, plant hormones, but a little
[SPEAKER_00]: less known, a little kind of those
secondary plant hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see their effects can be very
important and everything, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: promote the primary root growth,
leaf senescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are definitely important in
pathways of the plant, but maybe a little
[SPEAKER_00]: less understood, a little less kind of
commonly covered, but all covered here
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically with their own video that
you're welcome to check out here on
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco university.
