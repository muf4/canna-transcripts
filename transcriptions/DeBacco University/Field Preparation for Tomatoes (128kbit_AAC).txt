[SPEAKER_00]: If you're thinking about turning a field
into a tomato field, I'm going to go over
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the basic field preparations you
should be considering for that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: field to make it an effective crop for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the crop of tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're native to South America,
so they prefer warm weather and a long
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why they're not direct seeded in
New England and they need to be started
[SPEAKER_00]: early and transplanted into the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also go into season extenders
because these can be helpful to allow the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop to reach its full potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing site evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well when you're looking at a field,
you're generally looking for a site that
[SPEAKER_00]: has full sun, is well drained,
and does not have a lot of rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put an asterisk here for the not a lot
of rocks because the plants actually don't
[SPEAKER_00]: mind the rocks, but the person pounding
the stakes for support for those tomatoes
[SPEAKER_00]: will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or especially if you're using row covers,
a less rocky field would be advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now preparing that field for tomatoes,
we want a well drained field so they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not sitting in a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH around 6.0 to 6.8, slightly acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general nutrient profiles, we're
looking for them to be optimum soil
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients with special attention for
potassium and maybe calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at the two images of the soil
here, I can't tell you which one is better
[SPEAKER_00]: just looking at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people would say, well this one
looks darker, so it's probably better
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not necessarily a bad soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's important to take a soil
test to be able to determine what
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients are in the soil and what level
they're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're shooting for optimum and not
excessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now field preparation for tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're heavy feeders, so starting with
good levels is advised, while considering
[SPEAKER_00]: in-seasons supplementation at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically they're grown in rows for
efficient placement, irrigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and plant supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while this is a greenhouse situation
here, should be very similar to a field
[SPEAKER_00]: where they're nice, neat, and organized,
allowing for efficient treatment of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes, management of them, and able to
spot anything that potentially could go
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
