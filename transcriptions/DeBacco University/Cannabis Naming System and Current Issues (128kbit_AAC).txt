[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, welcome to another DeBaco
University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be looking at the
cannabis naming system that's currently in
[SPEAKER_00]: place and some of the issues involved with
that system when it comes to naming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here some dried flower,
kind of have the name tags here that have
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, even though it may say a
name on it, we may not have a very valid
[SPEAKER_00]: name and we'll talk about that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, there's the International
Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ICNCP.
[SPEAKER_00]: This regulates the naming of plants whose
recent evolution has been influenced by
[SPEAKER_00]: human selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, this would apply or pertain
to cannabis based on that definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we're looking at naming
certain types of cannabis, a lot of times
[SPEAKER_00]: we're using the term cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're using the term cultivar,
we have to realize that this is a unit of
[SPEAKER_00]: classification and it has a very specific
definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an assemblage of plants that A,
has been selected for a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: character or combination of characters,
B, is distinct, uniform and stable in
[SPEAKER_00]: these characters and C, when propagated by
appropriate means, retains those
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics, which is when we're
looking here at different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis or any plant in general,
this means it's basically, it's a unique
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a kind of distinct characteristics
and it is able to be propagated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what defines a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're looking at the room,
the rules for naming a cultivar,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to think of it kind of like a
sports event here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ICNCP has rules for naming,
describing cultivars in all valid
[SPEAKER_00]: publication, typification and priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is available online for consultation
and regarding these provisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are available to kind of take in
some feedback and to be able to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: some suggestions as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivar names meaning that the ICNCP
provisions are placed in single quotation
[SPEAKER_00]: marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the proper way to kind of scientific
name for that given plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's the genus, the specific
epithet and then the cultivar there listed
[SPEAKER_00]: in those single quotes at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not talking just about a simple
common name that has basically no rules
[SPEAKER_00]: and there may be multiple names for the
same plant and this also applies to
[SPEAKER_00]: animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, variety, form and strain do not equal
the same as the word cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So article 2.2 stipulates that the words
variety, form and strain must not be used
[SPEAKER_00]: for the word cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivar is its own distinctive kind of
entity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strain is not uniformly recognized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And strains are conceptually identical to
cultivars in concept, but almost no
[SPEAKER_00]: strains have met the official ICNCP
requirements for cultivar recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these sources would be located in
the description here of this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rules are in place for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like anything, we may not agree with
all of them, but they are in place for a
[SPEAKER_00]: reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an argument of the bigger picture
justifies using strain and cultivar as
[SPEAKER_00]: equivalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like, well, why don't we
have these rules, let's just call them the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really not the case here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a research here, Small in 2015 reported
that they showed insufficient respect for
[SPEAKER_00]: codes of nomenclature which hold a
pragmatic and moral status.
[SPEAKER_00]: By quoting, the botanical codes are by and
large adhered to by scientists,
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial interests, and editors because
they provide stability and reliability to
[SPEAKER_00]: names that otherwise would result in
confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the cannabis industry right now
is kind of like using the code is more
[SPEAKER_00]: what you call guidelines than actual rules
when there are official rules in place for
[SPEAKER_00]: the proper naming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just keep calm and follow those rules,
otherwise it's kind of going to result in
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of confusion, which sadly we have
a lot of right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the strain names.
[SPEAKER_00]: So strains become kind of numerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Leafley quote in 2015, it listed about
1,535 strain names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed Finder in the same year listed 6,510
strain names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most strains are recognized as hybrids
characterized as sativa dominant or indica
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind though that strain names are
swapped and counterfeited and generally
[SPEAKER_00]: unreliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're kind of like the picture we
have here with kind of the seltzer sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wind can come through and it can
change and look completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sadly what we're having with
these various strain names in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's in a name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, any strain has not been formally
described as a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the so-called sour diesel
should properly be named as cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: italics, strain sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The popularized name is without single
quotation marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that these names have no
taxonomic validity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you may know it as sour
diesel, just because it may be listed on
[SPEAKER_00]: the package of sour diesel, these really
don't have any true taxonomic scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: validity to those names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now kind of get into that strain name
variability, kind of pointing this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: AK-47 won the best sativa in the 1999
cannabis cup and then won best indica four
[SPEAKER_00]: years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even in kind of the cannabis cup of
high times, there's been a single strain
[SPEAKER_00]: that won best sativa and then four years
later it went in one best indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of helps prove that the
reliability of these strains is not really
[SPEAKER_00]: that great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last here, we're looking at just some
questionable kind of pedigree.
[SPEAKER_00]: The claimed anistry of super sour diesel
haze from seed finder.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you kind of go through and read through
here, what gives it kind of its
[SPEAKER_00]: questionable pedigree is when you see the
words like murky pedigree, it's either
[SPEAKER_00]: this or it could be that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should throw up us kind of some
caution there of like a red flag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some things may not quite be right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we see the terms like likely
derived from another example there where
[SPEAKER_00]: just because we know we have this end
product, where it actually came from is
[SPEAKER_00]: not really well defined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of that goes back to the poor
naming system currently in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
