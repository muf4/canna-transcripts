[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, in this lecture series, I'm going to
show you some identifications for
[SPEAKER_00]: verticillium well so you can determine if
you're seeing this in your grow operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the identification, well it's a
soil-borne fungus that can survive for
[SPEAKER_00]: four to 15 years depending on conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes this a little concerning is
that even under unfavorable conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: verticillium can last for four years,
and under more favorable, 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: How it will look on the leaves,
it kind of gets this kind of half the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of turning this yellow and ultimately
curling and getting a little bit of burn
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the microscope, it's got this
distinctive cluster-like look with these
[SPEAKER_00]: circles almost like grapes at the kind of
appearance that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now where to look for verticillium?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, you want to inspect the
roots because this is soil-borne.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in addition to that, if you have
a plant that's suspected of having this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can cut the stem on the plant that's
thought to be infected is recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why this is because this is a
vascular disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it does enter the roots,
it goes through the vascular system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there can be discoloration found as we
see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Verticillium can infect the xylem of the
plant in as little as 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a very quick and aggressive
fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welding may only occur on part of the
plant as it can be vascular system
[SPEAKER_00]: specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this means is it may only enter a
portion of the xylem, indicating half the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant will kind of wilt and the other half
will look just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows kind of the specificity of this
disease that can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather, just the whole plant going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it only gets into one particular bundle
of xylem, only a portion of the plant may
[SPEAKER_00]: wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you cut the plant, you may see
these distinctive rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's again indication potentially
having verticillium wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the fungus can survive in soil for
long periods with or without plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really not good news for
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know your chosen media source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it's reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: In newly opened containers, it's strongly
encouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't be reusing or having very old
containers hanging around for very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prevention is also the only reliable
method of control for this fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of gives you an idea what it
looks like under the microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to control it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there is limited control once
infection occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, there's no real good news there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some fungicides may help, but it should
not be relied upon for a cure for this
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it shows you a little bit of kind
of the leaf, how the leaf kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: structure will kind of look and wilt in
yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do cut into that stem,
typically we'll see that brown region
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is transported to the xylem,
which is in the vascular system of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while there's no great control,
prevention is the name of the game with
[SPEAKER_00]: verticillium wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
