[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over some of the timing of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis compounds and how they're
accumulated within the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into timing of
cannabis compounds here, looking at it
[SPEAKER_00]: from a scientific standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, some data here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to look at the original data,
always try to include that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is here at the Cornell Hemp
Association, they have a great little
[SPEAKER_00]: information that they've posted online.
[SPEAKER_00]: The link is right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be pulling some of the highlights
of that data here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from a 2019 CBD cultivar trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they were comparing total potential
CBD THC over time, and they have their
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of data presented right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So total CBD and total THC accumulation
curves for the 30 cultivars that they
[SPEAKER_00]: tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the color and here are the
cultivars that they chose to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most cultivars accumulate high levels of
cannabinoids by week two or three,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the top 10 centimeters of shoot tips
were sampled and cannabinoids were
[SPEAKER_00]: qualified using an HPLC, high pressure
liquid chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across most cultivar studies, the CBD and
THC trends seem to be similar,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are a few standouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at the data in general,
we're kind of seeing this general trend or
[SPEAKER_00]: this increase here overall of our kind of
cannabinoids here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is looking at CBD and this is
looking at THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are a few standouts and I
tried to highlight those here on our next
[SPEAKER_00]: slide right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two cultivars listed here peak their
CBD levels before THC reaches the maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what I want you to realize is
that both of these produce THC levels
[SPEAKER_00]: above the federal limit of 0.3% threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're looking at THC, this dotted
line represents the federal threshold of
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see just about all of these go
well in excess of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the two that I'm highlighting
here try to put in yellow and we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: that our CBD versus THC, towards the end
here, looking at weeks, say seven and
[SPEAKER_00]: eight or so, six, seven and eight,
we can see there's definitely a dramatic
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in the THC levels while the CBD
levels remain the same, if not trend
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly downward overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just important to remember that
if we're playing very close to that line
[SPEAKER_00]: of 0.3, waiting to the very end in some
cultivars might cause the crop to go
[SPEAKER_00]: what's called high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot or go above that theoretical
threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these examples, they were above it
even before that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't really apply to this
situation, but just again, something else
[SPEAKER_00]: to consider when you're looking at
choosing a cultivar and knowing what it
[SPEAKER_00]: might be producing, trying to maximize
your CBD production, but may go above that
[SPEAKER_00]: THC threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now most, as I said, will exceed that 0.3%
total THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is notable in some
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is possible for THC levels to increase
in the later weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is where choosing that
cultivar, knowing your cultivar,
[SPEAKER_00]: is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in this case, but in other cultivars,
this may be close to the 0.3% threshold,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this could be a notable observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of where you're taking the
cannabis plant and saying, are you in the
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp plant category or in the marijuana
plant category?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another research article here,
welcome to take a look out, looks at the
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation of bioactive metabolites in
cultivated medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, some are provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are cannabinoids accumulated and
where are they exactly accumulated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cannabinoids are synthesized and
accumulate in unfertilized female
[SPEAKER_00]: inflorescence, which is basically the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically within those flowers,
the trichomes that are found on the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface of the flower and also the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes are these small white
structures that we see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see definitely excessively
produced right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These other white structures here are
called the stigmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the trichomes being these
small white kind of structures here that
[SPEAKER_00]: look like they have a little like mushroom
type head on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the kind of schema for
developing the cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the cannabinoids we're talking about
here could be Delta 9 THC, could be CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: or CBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're seeing there's a lot of
complicated kind of biosynthesis pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of enzymes involved in genes in the
pathways have been kind of isolated to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of get an idea of where these are
derived from.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at the very early on,
this transferase, we're kind of looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the kind of the starting molecule here
would be CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of where we're starting all
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant kind of produces that to
synthesize the production from that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we have the CBGA, the plant then
can produce the THC synthase, CBDA
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase, or CBCA synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're getting that next kind of step
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're producing the THC, CBDA,
and CBCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we then have the heat or
decarboxylation step.
[SPEAKER_00]: To generate those final end products with
also carbon dioxide given off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on the inheritance of the
chemical phenotypes, the genes for THCA
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase, CBDA synthase are considered to
be co-dominant alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes back to our basic biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Co-dominant alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well alleles you've got one chromosome
from the male and one chromosome from the
[SPEAKER_00]: female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Co-dominants mean they can both be
expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's not going to be dominant and
recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be both expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of an important note when
we're looking at developing varieties or
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of looking at this pathway in more
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gene for CBCA synthase isn't on
independent locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's in a different location within the
entire genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, based on DNA sequencing and
analysis, one of the transcription
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed in marijuana and hemp samples,
multiple linked loci for the THCAS and TH,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry, and the CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: AS genes are proposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're having that even though
these might be distinctly separate in our
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways, there could be linked as far as
genetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's important for looking at
developing new varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are published genomes for cannabis
and the genetic diversity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthetic pathways of cannabinoids in
both marijuana and hemp strains is under
[SPEAKER_00]: investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to better understand these
particular pathways because some growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: some breeders might be looking at
producing more CBDA How can we go about
[SPEAKER_00]: that versus THC and staying below that
federal limit potentially?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they all originate from the same
molecule, how do we try to get the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to select for this particular pathway?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's deemed to be advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last, we have the kind of just
the bioactive forms of the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bioactive forms of cannabinoids are
produced following a light or heat induced
[SPEAKER_00]: decarboxylation reaction to generate the
CBG, the Delta 9 THC, the CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or ultimately the CBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these kind of are kind of
getting into the specific pathways of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant might be a little bit more kind of
in-depth and complicated there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it is kind of interesting just
to kind of have an idea and appreciation
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have an original molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, the plant is going
through with enzymes and activating
[SPEAKER_00]: different pathways to produce these
different compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of is great for looking at
research going into the future for trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to select one of these particular
cannabinoids over the other.
