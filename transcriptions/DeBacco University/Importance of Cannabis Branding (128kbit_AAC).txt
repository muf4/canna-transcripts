[SPEAKER_00]: This DeBaco University video is going to
look at the importance of branding when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to growing cannabis and creating a
sustainable business practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at the importance of
cannabis branding and growing a quality
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis product, branding it and getting
the word out there is a very important
[SPEAKER_00]: part of creating a sustainable business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off the job description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at a job description,
looking at a marketing manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the responsible for branding and
registering products for sale and keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: the company up to date and relevant within
the current industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this relevance can change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was popular one year or one set
might change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're seeing four week moving average
of market share of flower, market share of
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, looking at data, looking at trends,
trying to make predictions, all important
[SPEAKER_00]: considerations for the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Involving the marketing manager of any
cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the day-to-day activities are looking
at creating a principal display and
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary label that accurately reports
test results, statements, product
[SPEAKER_00]: identification information, and color
coding for sorting and identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Registers brands with the DCP,
files brand registration information,
[SPEAKER_00]: photographs products for branding,
and works with contractors in developing
[SPEAKER_00]: t-shirts, lanyards, pens, pads,
et cetera, as well as bags, a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of things and different ways to brand that
particular product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now important part here is that it says
photographs products for branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be a very critical part,
particularly for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at dry flower, really
showcasing that final product in the best
[SPEAKER_00]: way possible can really do a lot for the
branding and selling of that product going
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the qualities a person must have just
in general, willingness to work closely
[SPEAKER_00]: with others, good communication skills,
knowledge of the FTC and FDA regulations,
[SPEAKER_00]: must be creative, must be at least 21
years or older, degree and experience
[SPEAKER_00]: within the field is always welcome,
as well as pass a background check so
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be working in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So must be creative in the sense that
coming up with new ways, trying new
[SPEAKER_00]: things, realizing when something may not
be working and making adjustments from
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is kind of the connection to the
cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, branding goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that here with nutrients,
with t-shirts, there's a whole lot of that
[SPEAKER_00]: within the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis branding is a highly
important position within the industry as
[SPEAKER_00]: they control the company's image and
ensure that the company and its products
[SPEAKER_00]: have proper labeling and designs that are
appealing to the customers or the target
[SPEAKER_00]: customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proper branding builds reputation within
the industry and a consumer basis,
[SPEAKER_00]: all good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this could be for the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing, as I said, cannabis
plants, this could also be with
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers, could also be with lighting,
plant supporting equipment as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to keep that in mind,
keep that relevant because the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is constantly changing and a good
branding person will recognize those
[SPEAKER_00]: changes, be ahead of those changes,
make changes when necessary to keep their
[SPEAKER_00]: company on the competitive edge.
Thank you.
