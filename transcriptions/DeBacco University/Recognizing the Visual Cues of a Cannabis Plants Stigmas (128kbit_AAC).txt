[SPEAKER_00]: Ever look at your cannabis plant stigmas
and wonder if that can help you determine
[SPEAKER_00]: how ripe or when harvest should be for
your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well here I'm going to go over on this
DeBaco University video recognizing how to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at those visual cues of those stigmas
to try to give you some indication of how
[SPEAKER_00]: close you are to peak harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into recognizing the
visual cues of cannabis plants stigmas
[SPEAKER_00]: related to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, early development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stigmas start out as white and this is
when they are the most receptive to
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is when you definitely want to
keep any male plants or pollen away from
[SPEAKER_00]: them because this is when they're most
receptive to pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the stickiest, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the most, they're freshest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They most likely try to go through and
capture any random pollen grains that are
[SPEAKER_00]: existing around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say they start out white,
some cultivars, some varieties will kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of have more of a slight different
coloration, in this case a little pinkish
[SPEAKER_00]: hue.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you will, a rosy glow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most will be white, but keep in mind
there are some variabilities and that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: great thing to see with the diversity of
different types of cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there'll be this kind of lighter
coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as we get into kind of the progression
of those stigmas, as they age they will
[SPEAKER_00]: start to turn a kind of a blonde,
brownish, kind of tannish color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we can see some that are still in
white in coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting to see some getting this
kind of like tannish, brownish colorations
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a sign they all do not turn at
once.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a sign of that progression,
that aging that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're becoming less receptive to pollen
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of like drying out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where growers will probably be
shifting over to these structures,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a separate video on that if you
want to learn more about looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: determining the peak harvest, looking at
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting into that near harvest kind of
stigma color there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as harvest gets closer, the
percentage of the brown stigmas will
[SPEAKER_00]: increase to the point of nearly 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say nearly, might have a couple that
just kind of like to stay white for
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever reason, but nearly 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this may not be the main visual
signal used to determine the point of
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest, it can be a valuable indication
of the overall plant progress towards peak
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reason being, yes, you can look at the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically you need to have a little bit of
a magnifying and kind of zoom in on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the stigmas here kind of provide a
quick, if you're walking down an area,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking quick in an area, usually a little
bit more of a predominant structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And help give you that indication of the
progression of the development of that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can make a comparison with on the
same plant or within multiple plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure you're trying to hit that peak
harvest without getting any degradation of
[SPEAKER_00]: the valuable cannabinoids or terpenes that
your cannabis plant might be producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, thank you for watching, and I'll see
you next time.
