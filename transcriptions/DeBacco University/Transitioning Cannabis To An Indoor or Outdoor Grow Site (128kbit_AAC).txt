[SPEAKER_00]: Now, growers of cannabis can be indoors or
outdoors, and everyone thinks the other
[SPEAKER_00]: one's easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, here I'm going to go over how you
take your small cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: how you transition it to an indoor or an
outdoor site, what are the advantages and
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantages of each here on DeBaco
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, assuming you have a nice little
cannabis plant, let's go over if you put
[SPEAKER_00]: it in an indoor or an outdoor location,
what are some of the things, pros and cons
[SPEAKER_00]: with each.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, indoor or outdoor
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where will your seedling or clone be
spending the rest of its cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to think about, is it going to be
in the indoor, or is it going to be in the
[SPEAKER_00]: harsher outdoor environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a little less controls,
but also a little less upfront costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, for indoor applications,
what's the advantages?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a grower has control over the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can produce higher quality flowers,
and it can allow for specific
[SPEAKER_00]: experimentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great to kind of have this as an
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at creating experiments,
looking at strains, indoor environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: that control offers a lot of advantages,
offers a lot of kind of ways to see
[SPEAKER_00]: differences a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the disadvantages of being in an
indoor production is simply the cost of
[SPEAKER_00]: all the equipment that you need,
as you can see here in these examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to supply the lighting,
you need to supply the water, and you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to supply the air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also challenging things in
producing high total biomass simply
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the expense associated with the
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have a lack of natural outdoor
conditions, which again, could be
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage, could be disadvantage,
but in this case, a lack of natural
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor conditions, you have to make sure
you're regulating and simulating that
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor conditions to maximize the growth
of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for those outdoor productions,
again, our indoors productions,
[SPEAKER_00]: pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor, same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the advantages,
though, of growing outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, you have reduced cost of
production compared to indoor production,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I just mentioned, because you get
natural sunlight exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no need to go back to the
previous slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you need to have lights here with
different wavelengths and changing out
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbs and supplying electricity and
cooling that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you get natural sunlight exposure,
and that's kind of free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also easier to grow large quantities
because you don't have to worry about or
[SPEAKER_00]: enter the constraints of that kind of
lighting application there.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, all is not glorious.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also some disadvantages to
growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's simply a lack of control over
environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be too much water, too little
rain, too much sun, different soil types.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all things to take into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also increased pest pressure from
natural, as well as insects, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: larger, potentially deer, can also impact
the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain soil or field conditions are not
supportive for plant growth, so you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to be mindful of taking a soil test so
you're not putting your plants in an area
[SPEAKER_00]: that they may look good initially,
but then will not come to term at the full
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the harvest cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, each has their advantages and
disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to pick one, and you've got to
deal with some of the conditions you may
[SPEAKER_00]: have control or not control over,
and hopefully will produce a quality
[SPEAKER_00]: product regardless of indoor or outdoor
conditions, as long as you go about
[SPEAKER_00]: planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Good luck.
