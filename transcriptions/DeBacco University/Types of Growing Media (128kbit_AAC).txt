[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here I'm going to investigate
three major types of growing media.
[SPEAKER_00]: As often I get asked, well, you know,
which one's the best?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no direct answer to which
one's the best, but it's a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: that use kind of three main types,
or you may have your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's kind of the three main staples
that I see very commonly used.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is ProMix.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be considered a standard mix for
many growers, and certain grow shops will
[SPEAKER_00]: have bales of this all stacked on one
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a versatile mix, that serves not only
as a good standalone product, but it can
[SPEAKER_00]: provide a quality base to tweak for
individual needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have peat moss as its higher
percentage, which is typically 65 to 75%
[SPEAKER_00]: of the total product here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here this is ProMix BX with
mycorrhizaeans in general purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a lot of different sub-recipes
there, but this is kind of one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: standards just to consider as even a base
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also Metromix or Sungrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different blends for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some consider it to be confusing because
of all the options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important if you do find ones you
like to get the tag and to know exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what you get, so that you're able to go
through and repeat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sungrow Horticulture, Canada now owns many
other brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something else that's happening
in the marketplace, where one brand is
[SPEAKER_00]: going through and buying up other names
that you might be familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, Farford, Sunshine
Advanced, Black Gold, and Metromix are now
[SPEAKER_00]: all owned under Sungrow Horticulture of
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one here is Happy Frog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers like this company for not only the
growing media substrate, but also the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient charge that is typically added.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be pre-inoculated with
beneficial soil microbes, as we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: listed here in propping yields per gram
for the mycorrhizae and the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for bacteria, we see in CFU
column forming units per gram listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can make a ready to use product
directly out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why some growers prefer this
to use as part of their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are just three examples there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experiment, find something you like and
work with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a perfect growing mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find one you can work with and one that
you can modify and maybe use as a base
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all have their own little quirks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, watch the labels to make
sure that the manufacturer doesn't change
[SPEAKER_00]: what's inside the bag, even if they call
it by the same name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
