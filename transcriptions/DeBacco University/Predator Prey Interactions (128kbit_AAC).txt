[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at
predator-prey interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I did put this image here on the
title, I'm not quite sure how accurate it
[SPEAKER_00]: is, but it does get the point that the cat
here is the predator and the goldfish is
[SPEAKER_00]: the prey, and they're interacting with
their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So predation is the consuming of one
organism by another, and under simple
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory conditions, the predator often
exterminates its prey.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this does not typically occur in
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if our great blue herons eat all of the
sunfish, well, soon there would be no
[SPEAKER_00]: great blue herons, there'd be no food to
feed off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: If our prey mantis consumed all the flies,
there'd be no prey mantis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need this predator-prey interaction to
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while they are consuming other
organisms, they don't want to consume them
[SPEAKER_00]: to the point of extinction because then
they themselves would become extinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what ends up happening is this
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: In nature, predators and prey populations
often exhibit cyclical oscillations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here we have time here on the x-axis
and population on the y.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at our North American snowshoe
hare, and then here we have our Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: lynx, which feeds on the snowshoe hare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the snowshoe hare is the prey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, notice when the prey increases,
which could be for a multitude of reasons,
[SPEAKER_00]: soon after that, there's a delay,
the predators will also increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, when the prey
decreases, so will the predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, prey can increase for two different
main reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the food availability to the prey could
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, that would be willow trees
and birch twigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can help increase the food supply and
help increase the prey.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could also have a change in the
predator population, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Canadian lynx.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, the population is a little bit
lower, the prey will increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this could be a reduction in
food, or more likely, based on this data,
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in the amount of lynx,
the predator, present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that delay occurring,
and it decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see the prey starting to increase,
and then there's a delay here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the predators will also increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this cyclic kind of oscillation
that's occurring, this up and down motion
[SPEAKER_00]: that's occurring in the various
populations of the snowshoe hare and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian lynx.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these interactions are essential in
the maintenance of species in diverse
[SPEAKER_00]: communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So predators greatly reduce competition
exclusion by reducing the individuals from
[SPEAKER_00]: competing species.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, sea stars prevent bivalves
from dominating the intertidal habitats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other organisms can share this habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this term called keystone
species, and these are species that play a
[SPEAKER_00]: key role in their communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see here, we have a small amount of
our sea stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being eaten and consumed here by
the otters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's allowing kelp here to be able to
grow, to be able to flourish, and be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to create this kind of habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in this next situation, we remove our
keystone species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for whatever reason now,
its population has decreased.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see now, there's a lot of sea
stars present.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has severely reduced our population
of kelp, and that creates a loss of
[SPEAKER_00]: habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see these kelp beds, how extensive
they are, like forests below the surface
[SPEAKER_00]: of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, very sparse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reducing of habitat for small fish species
to be able to survive and really affecting
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire local ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're removing one species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the sea stars multiply, and they feed
on the kelp and reduce its ability to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and develop into these large kelp forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the term keystone species, as a way to
remember it, is the keystone, and an
[SPEAKER_00]: archway here is that center stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where it gets its name from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we take that keystone out, well,
the entire arch will fall apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see an example of a beaver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example of a keystone species may
develop in the beaver dams, changing the
[SPEAKER_00]: water flows, raising water levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can largely impact an ecosystem and
really change, if we remove the beavers,
[SPEAKER_00]: can really change how this local
environment behaves and what's allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive and what will sadly perish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the keystone species.
So that's the keystone species.
So that's the keystone species.
So that's the keystone species.
So that's the keystone species.
