[SPEAKER_00]: When discussing cells, surface area to
volume ratio is a very important concept
[SPEAKER_00]: to get an understanding of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, looking at surface area and
volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Length is simply just a distance between
two points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Area is a squared term, typically length
times width.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our volume here is a cubic term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Length times width times height,
or it could be depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different shapes will give you different,
basically, surface areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And volumes, depending on their size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here the comparison of
area to volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: The area to volume and how these different
shapes create these different ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're going to look at a
little bit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, why are cells so small?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a basic question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How come we're not just one big cell?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put a link to both of these YouTube
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first one here is a great job of
explaining certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes over the AgarCube experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which has to do with the diffusion of
certain components in different size cubes
[SPEAKER_00]: or blocks here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, cell size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cell sizes range from one millimeter down
to one micrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, they're still very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why this is, is cells need a
large surface area of plasma membrane to
[SPEAKER_00]: adequately exchange materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we see here is in our small
intestine, we have these villi,
[SPEAKER_00]: these kind of finger like structures,
you can kind of see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that allows is a lot of surface
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important because this helps and
aids in the ability for nutrients to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to diffuse across the membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have the picture here of a paper,
it's just flat, and a paper that becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: more and more folded.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're increasing the surface area here,
allowing for easier to exchange materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can think about if you just had a
solid area, very limited area you can have
[SPEAKER_00]: contact with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you take that same area and I put
all my fingers up now, now we have all
[SPEAKER_00]: these areas here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows for a lot more surface
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This diffusion process, the reason why
this is important is our cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, red blood cells,
example here, are taking in oxygen and
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diffusion is spontaneous, meaning there's
no energy invested that's required for the
[SPEAKER_00]: net movement of particles down a
concentration gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as we put a drop of food dye here,
it diffuses throughout all the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply using the molecular motion of the
water molecules here, it diffuses or it
[SPEAKER_00]: moves across the food dye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing here in our cells with
diffusion, oxygen is freely able to come
[SPEAKER_00]: in, CO2 is freely able to leave,
there's no energy required, very important
[SPEAKER_00]: for cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they have this great surface area to
volume ratio, this can occur
[SPEAKER_00]: spontaneously, no energy required,
which means that life can continue because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not a lot of demand for energy for
this purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call this the surface area to volume
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is because of this, it requires
cells to be small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here's our small intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see these kind of finger-like
projections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these are all cells, all lining these
entire peaks and valleys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we see zoomed in here of our villi,
we actually have microvilli.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have increased surface area even
without the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really what helps us absorb
our food much more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large cells, surface area relative to
volume ratio decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Volume of the living cytoplasm,
that's the inner portion of the cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: which demands nutrients and produces
waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to exchange those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cells specialize in absorption,
unutilized membrane modifications,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as microvilli, example here,
to greatly increase the surface area to
[SPEAKER_00]: volume ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: The picture of the feather here,
because the feather has very high surface
[SPEAKER_00]: area to volume ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of fine, fine hairs here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the same concept trying to
get to understand here on our microvilli.
[SPEAKER_00]: So example here, we have the same surface
area, but we're changing the volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we take that paper and we're folding
it, we're increasing the volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're changing that ratio of surface
area to volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting off, our surface area at the
beginning and end is actually the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: but our volume is changing dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what's affecting the ability
for cells to exchange nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's this look like mathematically?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have three cubes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One cube is just a solid block.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, we could say are individual
cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here there's basically eight of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have many more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to think about each of these
individual cubes as having their own
[SPEAKER_00]: independent kind of surface area and
volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they're all stacked up together here,
but think of them as independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at, comparing all three of
these initially, if we take the volume,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is simply the height times the width
times the length, number of cubes,
[SPEAKER_00]: we come up with the same number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all three of these are the same volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're noticing is different here is
the surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one big block as a result as a
relatively small surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, 96 centimeters cubed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has eight two centimeter cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is 192 centimeters squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has the many blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually 64, if you count them all
here, and they're only one centimeter
[SPEAKER_00]: cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has a surface area, total surface
area of 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: 384 centimeters squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we do the ratio out, which is surface
area over volume, we're noticing our
[SPEAKER_00]: surface area divided by our volume become
over 1.5 to one ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it's a three to one ratio,
and here it's a six to one ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher the number here, six to one
would be the highest, the greatest chance
[SPEAKER_00]: that diffusion can occur throughout the
entire cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here our surface area of diffusion is
going to be very limited, looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire volume of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it's going to be much more extensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why cells are small.
[SPEAKER_00]: To put this in perspective of a high
surface area to volume ratio patented
[SPEAKER_00]: biologically, elephant's ears,
or in this case, the rabbit's ears,
[SPEAKER_00]: are used for cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: High surface area to volume ratio,
meaning heat's very easy to exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may notice the heat sink curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have air foils here on computers or in
certain mechanics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is increasing the surface area to
allow heat to escape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radiator in a car does the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these, for examples, have a very
high surface area to volume ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, items that have a
very low surface area to volume ratio are
[SPEAKER_00]: used for heat retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whales, pretty large structure,
not a lot of folds, very smooth skin,
[SPEAKER_00]: limiting the amount of contact they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polar bears are given in a cold
environment, and penguins.
[SPEAKER_00]: All huddling together here, reducing the
total amount of exposed surface area to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of keep that heat in and more
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, there's a couple links here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, looking at some other available
resources for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all comes back to cells being small to
allow them to be a diffuse nutrient,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that occurs through a very high
surface area to volume ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
