[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're all at the simple and
hopefully not over complicated cloning
[SPEAKER_00]: method called the cut and stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as the name implies, you take a
cutting and you stick it into a media or
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of area where you're going to
encourage root development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cut and stick, the simple and easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the easiest of methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as the name implies, you're taking
the growing tip of the plant, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting it, and then sticking it into
growing media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scissors typically aren't encouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually we use a sharp knife.
[SPEAKER_00]: We stick them into media.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we have everything prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our cuttings and water ready to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a kind of important part of
the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while it is easy, I'm not sure
everything is set up ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're sticking the clone into,
the media can be a wide variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw in the previous image.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be soil-less mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be foam.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part is you need a media that's
going to support and keep that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: upright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use of rooting hormones such as Clon-X is
advised to help encourage rooting and
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the time to root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some optional materials with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use misting or a humidity dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can help increase the humidity and
reduce water stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemat is often used as well to help
increase the root zone temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these things help reduce plant
stress and increase the rooting
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the drawbacks to this method is
depending on the propagation environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as the light, the temperature,
humidity, moisture uniformity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This method may suffer from an
above-average percent of loss of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes you kind of get a tray that
may look like this, or you get a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: that just aren't going to make it,
and you have some that do make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more consistent you can keep the
conditions, the better odds that you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you can just take one,
put it right in a glass of water,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sometimes it'll root right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes this gives some people some
extra confidence and thinks that it can
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is one of the drawbacks is that
typically this can result in not 100% as
[SPEAKER_00]: some other methods, but considering it's
simple and it's ease, sometimes taking a
[SPEAKER_00]: small percent loss for not a lot of
investment in other things is advantageous
[SPEAKER_00]: for some growers.
Thank you.
Thank you.
