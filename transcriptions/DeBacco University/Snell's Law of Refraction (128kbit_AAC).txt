[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another video here on DeBaco
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be looking at Snell's
law of refraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now refraction, keep in mind light passing
through different mediums can cause
[SPEAKER_00]: bending of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what kind of makes the spoon look
like an optical illusion here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like it's broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because of the bending of the light
through those different mediums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Snell's law of refraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well Snell's law describes the behavior of
light as it travels from one medium into a
[SPEAKER_00]: different medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Snell's law can be written as N1
referring to the refractive index of
[SPEAKER_00]: substance 1 times the sine of angle 1
equals the refractive index N2 of
[SPEAKER_00]: substance 2 times the sine of the angle of
angle number 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now both of these angles are measured
relative to the normal or line drawn
[SPEAKER_00]: perpendicular, as you can see indicated
here, to the surfaces where the two
[SPEAKER_00]: mediums will meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Snell's law of refraction in order to
calculate this the refractive index of
[SPEAKER_00]: materials is based on the angle the light
hits and bends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that depicted here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light's coming in at this angle,
passes through the mediums, and it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: out at this angle through the second
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we can see all of the components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we can see all of them described.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, to best understand this let's
apply some numbers to this in actual
[SPEAKER_00]: mathematical equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at Snell's law example number
1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light traveling in air, which is
refractive index of 1, hits a piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: glass at an angle of 30 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light refracts in the glass at an
angle of 15 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is what is the index of
refraction of the glass?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we first want to do is take the
components given to us and apply them to
[SPEAKER_00]: the equation for what we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how we would go about this is we'd
start with the substance 1, refractive
[SPEAKER_00]: index is 1, that's going to be the air,
and it's a piece of glass at an angle of
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know the angle and substance 1,
we know the refractive index.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the light refracts in the glass at an
angle of 15 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know the angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it's asking for is what is the
refractive index of that glass?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's N2 in this example?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we go back to that equation,
we kind of plug everything in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, 1 times the sine of 30 equals
refractive index of substance 2 times the
[SPEAKER_00]: sine of 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, 0.5 is going to equal 0.258.
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.258 times N2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solving for N2, we get N2 has a refractive
index of 1.93.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the index of refraction of the
glass?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer would be 1.93.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to example two for Snell's law
here, slightly different example given
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light traveling in air has a refractive
index of one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a piece of glass at an angle of 45
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the glass has a refractive index of
1.5, what angle should the light bend at?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this example, I'm giving you now the
refractive index of the glass,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm asking you now to determine that
angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as we did before, you're going to
go through, you're going to find out all
[SPEAKER_00]: the information that you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know refractive index.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the angle in substance 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know the angle the light leaves,
but we do know the refractive index.
[SPEAKER_00]: So same as always, we plug everything in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're solving for the angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go through the same mathematical
process, multiply those, leave that there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Factor that down to the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get 0.4714 equals the sine of angle two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back and taking the inverse sine
there, we're getting that the angle would
[SPEAKER_00]: be 28 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here we're solving for the angle
before we're solving for the refractive
[SPEAKER_00]: index.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of both parts of the
calculating for Snell's law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here we have some Snell's law
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage you to pause the video
here, take a look at these, grab a
[SPEAKER_00]: calculator, and go through and solve for
some of these questions because the
[SPEAKER_00]: answers appear on the next slide,
and I will be reviewing them in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here pause the video,
work your way through these, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: compare your answers to the answers
provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've gone through and paused
the video at this time because here I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to give you the answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are your answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the first two are referring to
refractive indexes, and the last two are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you got these.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I suggest you go back and watch
the video again, and hopefully that will
[SPEAKER_00]: help you be able to answer any of these
questions that may show up in the future.
