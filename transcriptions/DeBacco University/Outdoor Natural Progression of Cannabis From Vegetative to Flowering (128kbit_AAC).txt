[SPEAKER_00]: On this Tobacco University video,
if you're growing plants outdoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do we kind of work on that progression
from the vegetative to the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: stage?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some things we need to keep in
mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are some considerations we should
be making?
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll all be presented here on this video
lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into outdoor natural
progression of cannabis from vegetative to
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we have to consider the
photo period, which also comes from just
[SPEAKER_00]: the natural sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with outdoor growers, plants will
flower based on the duration of sun that
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally changes with the seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In mid-summer, when days become shorter
than 12 hours, is when the photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period-dependent varieties will start to
flower, regardless of the plant's age.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, be mindful of any light pollution
on the plants, which can include but not
[SPEAKER_00]: limited to garden lights, streetlights,
or various spotlights that might offset
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant's natural perception of the
photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now timing is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with outdoor growing, there are a set
of conditions that growers need to plan
[SPEAKER_00]: accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The calendar will dictate the photo period
and also the typical weather to be
[SPEAKER_00]: expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both play an important role in cannabis
plant morphology development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure our timing is spot
on and everything looks nice and good,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if we're off, it definitely starts
to look very awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that calendar, so photo
period-dependent varieties will go into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower based on the photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the timing of the plants needs to be
based on day length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's timing based on when you choose
to plant them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auto flowers may not be impacted by the
day length, but there's also the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: season for many areas, which is shorter
than those that have a winter season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though auto flowers will just flower
X number of days old, we want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: we're maximizing favorable plant
environmental conditions based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: season and timing of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timing is important for outdoor growers
that is centered around their chosen
[SPEAKER_00]: planting date.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you can modify what the plants
will be exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at photo period
dependence, we want to take a look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers should look at duration of time
that has over 12 hours of sunlight and
[SPEAKER_00]: when the critical day length occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Planting should occur to ensure that
there's enough time for the vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: growth of the plants to support quality
bud production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of this depends on your degree
of latitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to be planting too late
in the season and only allowing plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: go through veg phase for a very short
period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind when you look at the
calendar, when should your planting date
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now auto flowering plants, well,
they may not change to flower production
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the photo period, but there are
other factors considered to maximize your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Providing plants with longer days can help
increase plant efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this needs to be taken into
consideration along with the local weather
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns to catch the optimum growing
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while planting height is in part
determined by the actual variety being
[SPEAKER_00]: grown, can also be influenced by the
timing of the planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: While a bigger plant can theoretically at
least produce more yield, a tall plant can
[SPEAKER_00]: be more likely to become wind damaged late
in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is common areas near coastlines that
may get tropical storms or hurricanes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, take that into consideration as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, staking or kind of plant support
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: For outdoor production, plant supports are
an option, but this may be more applicable
[SPEAKER_00]: to small growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the material you should be
considered as typically plants can get
[SPEAKER_00]: quite large and require strong supports,
which is often used with metal rebar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also depend on your pruning style.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in large scale
production, you may not be doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: pruning, but if you're growing in a
smaller operation outdoors, pruning might
[SPEAKER_00]: be an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Screen of green might be another worth
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you're laying out a bunch of trellis
netting, allowing plants to grow up to
[SPEAKER_00]: only keep them to maximize production per
plant, but to also provide some physical
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take these all options into
consideration when growing cannabis plants
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
