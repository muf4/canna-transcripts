[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to look at the
evolutionary path to apes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've had some students that look like
this, kind of when I'm giving lectures,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then when they realize all the slides
where I say there's a test tomorrow,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically students may kind of switch and
have a look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about these two
particular types of monkeys and what makes
[SPEAKER_00]: them each unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the evolutionary path.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the story of humans of evolution begins
around 65 million years ago with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Archimedes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this radiation is a lot of branching
that's occurring, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: diversification.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a way to think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the earliest primates have two
distinctive features that allow them to
[SPEAKER_00]: succeed in this aberral insect eating
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grasping fingers and toes and overlapping
binocular vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could see here evidence of our
grasping fingers and toes to climb limbs,
[SPEAKER_00]: hang from branches, and use tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: The overlapping binocular vision using two
eyes lets the brain judge at distance
[SPEAKER_00]: precisely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our binocular vision, when our eyes
overlap, we're able to determine how far
[SPEAKER_00]: an object may be close or away from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you know anyone who has damage to
one of their eyes, they may be restricted
[SPEAKER_00]: from playing certain sports because of
their lack of depth perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 40 million years ago, and YA stands
for a million years ago, the earliest
[SPEAKER_00]: primates split into two groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have this kind of before monkeys
group that we kind of allocate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a smaller group.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably nocturnal, and
herbivores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only a few survive today, so they're very
ancient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, the monkeys that now have
kind of developed in hominids have
[SPEAKER_00]: replaced or reduced the amount of these
particular monkeys that are around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So higher primates include monkeys,
apes, and humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are diurnal and herbivores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember diurnal is referring to
organisms that are awake during the day
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to our nocturnal, are organisms
that mainly function at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also involve bigger brains,
improved senses, and adapted for daytime
[SPEAKER_00]: foraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Live in groups with complex social
interactions and tend to care for the
[SPEAKER_00]: young for prolonged periods of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all examples of this particular
type of monkey, the diurnal versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: predecessors, which were mostly nocturnal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early anthropods are now extinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anthropoids, sorry, are now extinct,
and they evolved in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their direct descendants are Old World and
also New World monkeys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I refer to Old World monkeys.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are ones that kind of stayed in
Africa, split into kind of two lineages,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Old World and the hominids,
and mainly ground dwellers, and don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a prehensile tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The New World monkeys, as you see here in
South America and Central America,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's where they migrated to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They developed in isolation and are at
Ebro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have that prehensile tails.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of what a New,
I'm sorry, an Old World monkey would look
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an example of a New World
monkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're comparing our apes to hominids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hominids evolved from these, and apes and
hominids and humans are the direct
[SPEAKER_00]: descendants, or the direct ancestors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So directly descended from these hominids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chimpanzees are the closest living human
relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they share about 98.4% of their
nuclear DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorillas and humans share about 97.7%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that in perspective, what percentage
of your genes do you share with other
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's about 98% with the chimpanzees,
92% with the mouse, leaving out 44% with
[SPEAKER_00]: the fruit fly, 26% with yeast,
and 18% with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see there is still a fair
amount of overlap, even though we might be
[SPEAKER_00]: very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to organisms that might even be
in different kingdoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comparing apes to hominids, you see our
similar structures in the same colors
[SPEAKER_00]: here, but there's also some distinct tape
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the femur in this case is angled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here our femur is angled in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our pelvis is, for us, is bowl shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the chimpanzees, long and narrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see again some of the
comparisons that are derived here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The common ancestor for both apes and
hominids sought to have been an aberral
[SPEAKER_00]: climber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hominids became bipedal, which means
walking upright, bi meaning two,
[SPEAKER_00]: pedal mean walking, walking upright with
two legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apes evolved knuckle walking, and that's
what you kind of see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of hunched over appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's anatomical differences between the
two are related to a bipedal locomotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're walking upright,
certain things are going to kind of shift
[SPEAKER_00]: in shape to make it more efficient than if
you're what's called a knuckle walker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a hunched over look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the concept of bipedalism seems to have
evolved as our ancestors left dense
[SPEAKER_00]: forests for grasslands and open woodlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in amongst the trees,
there's a lot of overgrowth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of knuckle walking, hunched over
way of getting around might be
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you go to the open field
here, upright and bipedalism is definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: favored.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is did bipedalism proceed or
succeed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Brain enlargement, which came first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fossils unearthed in Africa demonstrate
that bipedalism extended back four million
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Substantial brain expansion, on the other
hand, did not appear until two million
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this evidence suggests that bipedalism
occurred before brain expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I mentioned, bipedalism,
if you've seen videos online, maybe of
[SPEAKER_00]: dogs walking with purses here upright,
this is not an example of true bipedalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is simply an animal that's kind of
learned to kind of walk upright.
[SPEAKER_00]: The true bipedalism here, we see the
change in structural features causing it
[SPEAKER_00]: to be more efficient for that particular
organism to walk in this upright fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
