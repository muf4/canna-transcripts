[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this DeBaco University video,
where I'm going to cover how to set up a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tent for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to walk you through the process
that I went through to set up this Sun Hut
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tent, the big and easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll kind of walk you through the process,
starting with taking everything out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: package here and setting it up that
ultimately received the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you enjoy this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be setting up the Sun
Systems big and easy grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This size here is two feet by four feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to see how easy it is to
assemble.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're looking at the
instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always good to have these handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at them ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you get your parts list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you have some idea of assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, make sure you have the
right grow tent instructions that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: following.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's those list of materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here is them all here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all are spread out, just checking to
make sure we have everything before we
[SPEAKER_00]: begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're now we're not missing anything,
which can be a very frustrating part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But luckily here, everything was present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've organized that with the bottom being
down on this end and this area here is the
[SPEAKER_00]: top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I've taken all the poles out and see
that they're nicely organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all my number ones to the
number twos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over here, I've put my number
threes also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this keeps everything nice and
organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going through in some way,
simply following the instructions here for
[SPEAKER_00]: the two by four size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did is I went through,
attached all the corners there,
[SPEAKER_00]: opened up the whole bottom, fit it right
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice this is the top all
unzipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little messy right now, but we're
going to work on building the upper
[SPEAKER_00]: sections so that we can start to have the
grow tent come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working on installing the upper ones here,
start giving it some height.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the base building up here on the
vertical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Need to put one of these connectors,
insert that on top of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking our next pole, number three,
putting it in there to get us to our near
[SPEAKER_00]: final height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now go through and we'll do the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going through and attach
these here.
[SPEAKER_00]: After we attach those, you can see we're
putting on the other bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've forming the rest of the
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've got the basic frame for the
entire structure built, the way up
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we just have to take the covering and
put it over the supporting structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now for the most part, it's all
assembled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Key part is you want to make sure that all
the corners are nice and snug and tight to
[SPEAKER_00]: give it its nice structure and support.
[SPEAKER_00]: There.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we got a couple more things to do,
but kind of the hardest and most struggle
[SPEAKER_00]: part is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're installing the vertical
supports, we want to make sure we have
[SPEAKER_00]: these in the down position.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, and then we're running
the other support ones and this way in the
[SPEAKER_00]: up position.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this allows is this overlap to occur
so that when we're going to hang
[SPEAKER_00]: something, which we are, such as our
lights and carbon filter, creates a much
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger structure here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, organizing your upper supports
correctly can help ensure that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: hang some weight off it and everything
will hold together just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the bottom of the grow tent,
make sure we install this in liner to
[SPEAKER_00]: catch any water that might spill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just simply just hold this place right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go through and attach it with Velcro to
the poles here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep this inside to keep everything nice
and contained in case we do have some
[SPEAKER_00]: water leaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not leave the grow tent and spill
those surrounding area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on this grow tent, there's a screen
here, a fine mesh screen for ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a viewing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also make these Velcro reflective
Mylar pieces at one place to block that
[SPEAKER_00]: out if we want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can help seal that up right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows us to open it later if we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have great ports here for power,
exhaust fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can also through inside,
if you look, also have the ability to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of seal those up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is that screen port that we just
blocked off and this will have an area we
[SPEAKER_00]: can pull tight when we install our cords.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's our finely assembled grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend it to two people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be a little easier at times with
two, but I did it with just one person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see at least how initially
the general setup looks in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be looking to get this throughout
and adding a couple more options to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can support some plants for growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice about the two by four size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fits right through a doorway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going through and put it in
one area and go into another, they'll go
[SPEAKER_00]: right through a standard door as we have
here without need for disassembly.
Thanks for watching and we'll see you next
time.
