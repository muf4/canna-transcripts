[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going over a hominid
evolutionary tree and kind of giving you
[SPEAKER_00]: some background information on some of the
predecessors to the modern day homo
[SPEAKER_00]: sapiens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off we want to look at the
hominid evolutionary tree and there are
[SPEAKER_00]: two major groups of hominids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genus homo is comprised of about three
to seven species depending exactly how you
[SPEAKER_00]: count them or classify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Australopithecus has seven species and
they're older and smaller brained.
[SPEAKER_00]: These characteristics are bipedal,
they're about a meter tall, about 18
[SPEAKER_00]: kilograms in weight and you can see kind
of these different kind of structures to
[SPEAKER_00]: these individuals here in comparison to
the homo genus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the brain size is different as
well as the general structure and size of
[SPEAKER_00]: the individual on average.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this genre, this species,
this subdivision so we're getting more
[SPEAKER_00]: specific as we kind of break this apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fossils for these are only found in Africa
and the brains are not any larger than
[SPEAKER_00]: those if you compare them to apes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now within the early human migration
pattern there's a clad and that's a group
[SPEAKER_00]: of organisms believed to have evolved from
a common ancestor according to the
[SPEAKER_00]: principles of cladistics meaning all the
individuals here can be traced back to one
[SPEAKER_00]: common ancestor amongst all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early human migration pattern you can
see kind of this out of Africa model where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at the oldest kind of
components here about 200,000 years ago in
[SPEAKER_00]: the red and kind of the arrows pointing to
the potential migration of those
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can see that they migrated pretty
much north a couple went to the west this
[SPEAKER_00]: region up here into kind of what we know
as modern-day Europe and Asia and then
[SPEAKER_00]: over into North America as well as
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's kind of interesting to note is that
if you look at the numbers Australia
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred about 50,000 years ago but New
Zealand not far geographically as looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at mileage wise only 1,500 years ago
however keep in mind that there is a not a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of island jumps to occur to get to New
Zealand so this is the reason why while
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not separated very far if you were
to measure them on a map like this there's
[SPEAKER_00]: this large separation in time because of
the isolation of New Zealand compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: that of Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the last stages of hominid evolution
modern humans first appeared in Africa
[SPEAKER_00]: about 600,000 years ago three human
species were thought to have evolved we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to talk about these in a little bit
more detail and there's a link here and
[SPEAKER_00]: some images here of the different skull
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one here Homo
halidelbergensis evolved from Africa about
[SPEAKER_00]: 600,000 years ago migrated to Europe from
Western Asia was the first early human
[SPEAKER_00]: species to live in colder climates their
shore wide bodies were likely adapted for
[SPEAKER_00]: conserving heat they had a reduced surface
area to volume ratio lived in the oldest
[SPEAKER_00]: times it defined controlled a fire and use
of wooden spears it's also the first early
[SPEAKER_00]: human species to routinely hunt large
animals through some defining
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics this early human also
broke new ground and was the first species
[SPEAKER_00]: to build shelters create simple dwellings
out of wood and rocks at first account to
[SPEAKER_00]: establish a house or a living structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking here at Homo erectus lived about
1.6 million years ago oldest known early
[SPEAKER_00]: humans to have possessed modern human like
body proportions with relatively elongated
[SPEAKER_00]: legs and shorter arms compared to the size
of the torso this means that they kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: lost that earlier tree climbing
adaptations with the ability to walk and
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly run long distances giving them
the ability or more suited for long
[SPEAKER_00]: distance travel along land versus being
able to more efficiently climb trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Homo neanderthalensis appeared in
Europe about 130,000 years ago just as the
[SPEAKER_00]: Homo helidelbergensis was becoming rarer
they likely branched off the ancestral
[SPEAKER_00]: line leading to modern humans DNA has been
recovered from these in more than a dozen
[SPEAKER_00]: Neanderthal fossils from Europe and also
Asia their brains are just as large as
[SPEAKER_00]: ours and there's evidence that they
deliberately buried their dead just an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting note no other species had ever
practiced this sophisticated behavior
[SPEAKER_00]: before and they abruptly disappeared about
34,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Homo sapiens wise men evolved from
Africa again about 130,000 years ago and
[SPEAKER_00]: they migrated to Europe and Asia and then
ultimately North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called the recently out of Africa
model and this model is supported by a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of gene studies looking at
mitochondrial DNA exomy chromosomes and
[SPEAKER_00]: also autosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We as humans are unique animals and the
product of evolution our evolution has
[SPEAKER_00]: been marked by a progressive increase in
brain size being able to have refined and
[SPEAKER_00]: extended conceptual thought symbolic
language and cultural evolution as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at major evolutionary
transitions we're seeing kind of this
[SPEAKER_00]: progression over time we got the cells the
human evolution to brains we're also now
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of going into the digital and
potential bio digital fusion of a we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at kind of that independent kind
of technology being able to kind of work
[SPEAKER_00]: on its own almost behavioral like a brain
so we're getting into where are we going
[SPEAKER_00]: from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at evolution in general kind of
fun math for consideration if the human
[SPEAKER_00]: generation times about 25 years that means
over 100 years will be about four
[SPEAKER_00]: generations as you try to show in the
picture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli generation time for comparison only
takes about 20 minutes so that means E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli can have essentially 72 generations
in a single 24 hour period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans differed from chimpanzees is
estimated to be about seven million years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago which equates to about 280,000
generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli to go through that same time period
it only take about 3,800 almost 900 days
[SPEAKER_00]: or a little over 10 and a half years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been known that E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli has been a significant public health
problem since 1982 or 32 or so years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is kind of interesting how the
rates of evolution may change or be
[SPEAKER_00]: altered.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at cockroaches and sea
lampreys have really not changed much in
[SPEAKER_00]: the last 300 million years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of brings apart the question
here I'm going to end it with how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think you got here where do you think you
come came from just some fun thoughts for
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration when you're talking about
the subject of evolution how did we get
[SPEAKER_00]: here and where are we going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
