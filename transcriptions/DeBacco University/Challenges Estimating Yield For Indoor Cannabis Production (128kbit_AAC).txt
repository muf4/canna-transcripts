[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this DeBaco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be looking at challenges estimating
yield for indoor cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of growers ask, well,
how does indoor compare to outdoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to be my yield for an indoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go over some of the
complexities while there's not just a
[SPEAKER_00]: quick short answer to that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, looking at this reference
article here, which is where I've pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: the data from that you're going to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that this article was kind of
looking at it more from an investigation
[SPEAKER_00]: forensics kind of angle, but it does
provide some good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they first looked at, of course,
you know, looking at gross revenue when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at gross revenue for our
indoor grow operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had four areas, four rooms,
I should say, that were under the
[SPEAKER_00]: investigation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking at the room numbers,
the number of cycles, number of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: were grown, sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is euros per kilogram, yield per
plant and grams, yield per cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: total yield and gross revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The multiplication of the prices and the
total yield in the table above reveals the
[SPEAKER_00]: gross revenues we see here obtained in
each growth room, according to the court,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a correction for the assumed number
of growth cycles in the first growth room
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there was some assumptions being
made here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the number of plants being as
low as 266 and as high as over 5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: The total gross revenue from all grow
rooms together is an estimate to have been
[SPEAKER_00]: over 5.5 million euros over the period
from August 6, 2005 to March 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, again, what they were
investigating as part of this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is it, again, so hard to kind of
like look in all this suspected gross
[SPEAKER_00]: here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the judicial file on the case study
also mentions revenue estimates provided
[SPEAKER_00]: by the grower based on his claims and
yield, number of gross cycles and prices
[SPEAKER_00]: paid by the buyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just more confounding data
points that make it difficult to pinpoint
[SPEAKER_00]: or get an exact number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's the total yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the number of plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the buyers willing to pay for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what causes that source of
potential confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're looking at what can we
glean from this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What information can we get?
[SPEAKER_00]: What data should we be collecting?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the courts are collecting,
it's probably a good idea for us to also
[SPEAKER_00]: be collecting it as a qualitative data
gathering and canvas cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus on directly observable and
measurable data to be collected upon
[SPEAKER_00]: confiscation of cannabis plantations are
strongly encouraged by police and judicial
[SPEAKER_00]: actors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what information are they be
collecting?
[SPEAKER_00]: What information should growers be keeping
track of?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that should be the number of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems kind of obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how big of an area?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many plants per square meter or per
square foot?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the surface being cultivated?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the pot volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been the container volume being grown
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lamp number.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: The type and power of those lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The type and number of installations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the lights, but maybe the HVAC
system, the cooling system, the heating
[SPEAKER_00]: system, equipment and fertilizer
containers, as well as many other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are just some key points growers
should be keeping track of to ensure they
[SPEAKER_00]: have a successful operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with just the short list provided
here, we can see the variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it makes it very difficult
to estimate yields and especially yields
[SPEAKER_00]: over a long period of time, because some
of these will have a lot of upfront costs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then reduced reoccurring costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a little difficult there,
but this just gives you an idea of some
[SPEAKER_00]: data presented in the information for this
article that was presented in a court
[SPEAKER_00]: setting.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
