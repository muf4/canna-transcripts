[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
we're going to give you a brief overview
[SPEAKER_00]: of how to identify and control Cercospora
in cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Cercospora is not unique just to
cannabis, but this is kind of what it
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on a microscopic view, this kind of
looks like this long straight little like
[SPEAKER_00]: thread almost or worm looking like thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, how do you go about properly
identifying in cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it starts as kind of small yellow
flecks developing into lesions,
[SPEAKER_00]: which turn into light tan or white with
yellow halos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in severe cases, it develops chlorosis
leading to defoliation as we see down
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The infection begins on older leaves and
moves through the canopy from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: General conditions of the fungi is that
the pathogen survives mainly in plant
[SPEAKER_00]: debris as desiccated resistant
pseudomonia, but can also survive as
[SPEAKER_00]: canidia in debris or seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's multiple regions where it can
hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: When moisture is sufficient, new canidia
are formed and spread via rain splash or
[SPEAKER_00]: wind to new leaves or plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how it's spreading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Autumnal conditions are 77 to 95 degrees
Fahrenheit with nighttime temperatures
[SPEAKER_00]: above 61 degrees Fahrenheit and a relative
humidity of 90 to 95%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Infection is greatly reduced or
nonexistent at temperatures less than 59
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Fahrenheit or during periods of
leaf wetness that are less than 11 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking at kind of beating
back the disease and you have control over
[SPEAKER_00]: your conditions, while not great for
growing the plant, below 59 can really
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce or really eliminate its chance of
spreading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about the life cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: As with any disease, good to understand
the general life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see those kind of finger-like
thread-like protrusions there that are
[SPEAKER_00]: leading to the canidia, which is the
primary inoculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have our leaf spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have secondary inoculum kind of
infecting that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have infective plants that then
lead to infected debris.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the stroma surviving an infective
plant debris in soil where it resides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the stroma producing spores can
then go through and cause that primary
[SPEAKER_00]: infection and repeat that life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see the same thing where we have
our disease develops as the leaves appear
[SPEAKER_00]: as leathery, dark, kind of bronzy
colorations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the disease can cause a
defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves fall to the ground and that's
where this fungus will survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's particularly looking in soybeans,
but the same basic process occurs in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winter rain can spread spores to young
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the fungal toxin and sunlight
interact, causing the pedofoliar symptoms
[SPEAKER_00]: as we see here and repeat the cycle again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do we manage this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is showing it in some other
plants as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But identifying developing resistant
varieties will be important going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three-year rotation in outdoor fields that
have had a positive identification of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Avoid planting sugar beets near cannabis
because they definitely are more prone to
[SPEAKER_00]: this and that could potentially cause an
increase in the local pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be mindful of what it is, what it looks
like, how to identify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: May not be able to identify it in the
microscopic level, but hopefully these
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptions as well as macroscopic
pictures provide you with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding and you can kind of
hopefully not plant sugar beets near the
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rotate if you can and try as a way of
management to mitigate the negative
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts that Cercospora can have on your
cannabis plants.
