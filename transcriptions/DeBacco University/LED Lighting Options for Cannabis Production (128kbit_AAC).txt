[SPEAKER_00]: In the artificial lighting market,
LED lighting is getting a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: popularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to go through some of the
options related to cannabis production
[SPEAKER_00]: here on Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into some of the LED
lighting options for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, LED light is a high powered
light emitting diode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of shows the kind of the inter
mechanics of what is involved in those
[SPEAKER_00]: little tiny diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not going to spend a ton of time on the
mechanics, but realize that there is a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in each of those little LED chips
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So LED color mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get certain colors, types of white
LEDs are produced with the red,
[SPEAKER_00]: green, and blue color mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a lot of kind of mixture of
those colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how they're able to get kind of
that pure kind of white light by mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: the LEDs that they're adding to get that
color mixing to get potentially certain
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths or a combination of
wavelengths for those plants to be exposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the advantages here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So LED advantages on plant growth and
development compared to conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for some lights, growers can select
specific wavelengths for customized plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: The versatile control of the flux
emissions and light spectrum, high
[SPEAKER_00]: luminous efficiency, small size and
directional light emissions down towards
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a long life expectancy,
actually up to 50,000 plus hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduced heat emissions, but that does not
mean no heat emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not get dim with age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Economical in terms of space and power,
at least for wattage requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: More robust structures and easier to
handle and easy to dispose of without any
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental hazards that might be
contaminants in other bulb or lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this, it sounds like almost too
good to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a win-win.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, features to look for when we're
looking specifically at LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want an LED light that does not have
fans to help cool it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fans have a tendency to fail sooner than
the actual bulbs or diodes will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the fans start to fail, it'll
overheat and potentially damage your
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also full spectrum, we want to go beyond
just the PAR reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can see here, this would be a full
spectrum light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're dimmable, that's another great
option, particularly if you're ceiling
[SPEAKER_00]: height limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light intensity that matches the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're enriching with carbon
dioxide, higher light outputs can be
[SPEAKER_00]: utilized by the plants compared to
non-enriched environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you're getting the proper
fixture that matches your growing
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's the great debate between the
high PAR and the full spectrum LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high PAR look like this and the full
spectrum look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: High PAR is that kind of purpley light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pros is that they're very efficient at
producing high PAR values.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the cons are they're hard to
diagnose plant abnormalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, I would not recommend the high
PAR lights simply because plant production
[SPEAKER_00]: can utilize more than only the PAR
spectrum and potential plant issues can
[SPEAKER_00]: easily be missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only is it harder for the grower to
identify potential issues with their
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, plant service we're learning more
about them, particularly cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: might be able to utilize more than just
the PAR reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, it's great and plants can be grown
well with these lights, but really I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend more the full spectrum lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Produces wavelengths outside of just the
PAR spectrum, which cannabis plants can
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize and potentially can get better
yield or better quality as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they can be more expensive,
but they're highly recommended for plant
[SPEAKER_00]: production in general, especially cannabis
that has high light intensity demands and
[SPEAKER_00]: growers are also interested in plant
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to mention the added benefit of being
able to diagnose potential disease or
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient deficiencies very early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, just looking at one example here
of one of these LED lights, the Gavita Pro
[SPEAKER_00]: 1700 E LED, just to give you kind of an
example of one and kind of what they may
[SPEAKER_00]: look like and they come in very different
forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this one because it simply gives
you that nice little chart there to see as
[SPEAKER_00]: well what it's producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can reduce the HVAC needs because
they're not producing as much heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a nice even design here,
very spread out amount of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a lot of advantages,
but again, this is just one comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do another video on exactly comparing
some specific brands of LED lights here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Tobacco University that you're welcome to
go search the channel for and check out.
