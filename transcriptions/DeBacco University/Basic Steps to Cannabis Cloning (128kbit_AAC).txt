[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this DeBaco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to be going over and
showing you the basic steps to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a lot of videos I've talked about
some of the methods you should go about
[SPEAKER_00]: doing when you're looking at cloning,
some of the process you should go through,
[SPEAKER_00]: but here I'm actually going to show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the video here
where I'm actually going to show you the
[SPEAKER_00]: basic steps to cloning your cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over how to
take a cannabis clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see right here in our grow tent,
a nice mother or stock plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things you need to keep in mind,
you need to have your cloner already
[SPEAKER_00]: running, which it is, and we'll see that
at the end stages here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a beaker here of just some
water because we have to transport these
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to try to reduce the chance of stress
on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to dip them right in that
regular water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some people will use a knife.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use very sharp pruning shears to
go through and take our clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look here, looking at this,
this is the wife variety or wife strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at how we're going to take a
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure we're always cutting
at a particular leaf node.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to just cut randomly halfway
through in between that internode area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to make sure we're cutting at a node
because one that will allow us the maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of stem area, but it will also
allow us if we take a clone right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll allow us in the future to take a
future clone as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're maximizing the cloning
opportunities that we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just looking at this one right here,
probably going to go right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: clip it right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be our wonderful little
clone right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to submerge it in the water
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, to keep it nice and hydrated while
we go to the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll go through and take a couple more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I chose this specific area
here is if you look a little bit closer,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can see right here where I took the,
took the clone, that's going to allow this
[SPEAKER_00]: one to be taken potentially in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allow this one to kind of grow out a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here we could see the reason why
I took this here is this will allow this
[SPEAKER_00]: one to grow out and we can kind of look
down this same branch and maybe take
[SPEAKER_00]: another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at this one being right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another quality clone right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick this right in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that one hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just a quick example here of
now allowing this one potentially to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: out and maximizing the productivity we get
from one single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that just gives you a little bit of
an idea there of the size of the clone and
[SPEAKER_00]: speaks well to the health of the mother or
stock plant right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at this branch right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see there was a previous clone
taken and that now has induced a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these side branches to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes we want the clones a little
bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, looking at the stretching
that they've gone on and done,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can probably take many of these for
clones right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to go through and be
very precise with my sharp scissors and
[SPEAKER_00]: take a bunch of these cuttings that we're
going to clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just tossing them in a beaker of water I
have prepared already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, some of these might be on the
smaller side, but always good to
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's, you know, on the smaller side
there overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, no complaints there when we're
looking at taking a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just want to make sure we're putting that
directly into some water so it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting stressed before we bring it over
to our cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just shows a great example of how we
took one and now we're getting a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: more and I might leave that one going
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, a great way to maximize your
clones from one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
I'll see you next time.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
