[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm going to give you some details
about metal halide grow lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: abbreviated MH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind these are not the same as
ceramic metal halides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just your plain old metal halides.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are being used less and less it
seems like as the years go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metal halide lights are available in a
wide variety of wattages, 6 and 1000 watts
[SPEAKER_00]: being the most common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each wattage has a suggested grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically at 1000 watts it's covering
about a 5 by 5 area and at 600 about a 4
[SPEAKER_00]: by 4 area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bulbs can differ by manufacturer but if
you see a super bulb it'll be brighter
[SPEAKER_00]: than a standard bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: While commonly rated with a life of about
9,000 hours most growers will replace
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbs after 6 to 12 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind when you are changing out
your metal halide bulbs to dispose of them
[SPEAKER_00]: properly because of some of the contents
that they have can be considered toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure we're just not
throwing them out we're disposing of them
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically recommended for the vegetative
stage of growth these metal halides phase
[SPEAKER_00]: due to the increased amount of blue light
to keep the internode distance minimal in
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also have good canopy penetration
but often requires cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The internode distance prevents plants
from stretching and getting really leggy
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is why metal halides are typically
used in the vegetative phase of growth.
