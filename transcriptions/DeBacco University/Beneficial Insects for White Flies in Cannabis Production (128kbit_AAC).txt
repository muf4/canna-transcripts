[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have identified whiteflies in
your growing operation, well, this video
[SPEAKER_00]: here on Tobacco University is going to
provide you with some beneficial insects
[SPEAKER_00]: to go about controlling those whitefly
pests that you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into beneficial
insects for whiteflies in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, this is all based off of a
research article that you're welcome to
[SPEAKER_00]: check out following this reference and
link to look at some more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: materials, methods, and details provided
in the original study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will provide an overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, in general, insects can be a
challenge in greenhouse production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, the go-to for insects has been
synthetic chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, due to strict legalizations and
restrictions of pesticides, this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: driving force in the development of new,
environmentally friendly, but yet
[SPEAKER_00]: profitable methods of pest control,
which will be presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, just some basics on the
greenhouse study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was conducted at the Agricultural
University in Athens, and their cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants were grown in two different
greenhouses, one's with the beneficials,
[SPEAKER_00]: one without the beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Manichaeus variety that was
utilized, and this also provides you with
[SPEAKER_00]: an idea of the temperature and humidity
fluctuations in the greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is important when you're looking at
implementing a biological control measure
[SPEAKER_00]: such as these insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the release date for these insects,
well, three weeks after transplantation,
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects were released in the
treatment greenhouse in order to assess
[SPEAKER_00]: the efficiency of the biological pest
management, the efficacy of the biological
[SPEAKER_00]: pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whiteflies are going to be the focus
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this research study did look at
others, but they were identified in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is generally what they look like,
your simple identification, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: general symptoms to look for if you're
dealing with them as a potential pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the basic measurements that were
occurred were visual estimations of the
[SPEAKER_00]: infestation, recording the pest species
populations, and the comparisons of
[SPEAKER_00]: infestations between the two greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind only the nymphs and adult
stages of the pest were counted,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the egg stage for any of the insects
they studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're curious on what insects you
may have, this is a common group of
[SPEAKER_00]: insects that commonly affect plants there,
so you can identify them right here
[SPEAKER_00]: through a quick visual guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how were the pest populations
determined of our whiteflies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, typically they were taken in the
third, fifth, seventh, and ninth week
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were using a 1,600 times microscope
to quantify the efficiency of the
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the average pest populations were
measured on 10 plants, four leaves per
[SPEAKER_00]: plant per greenhouse in the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with any pest we're trying to deal
with, it's very important to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: the life cycle of that pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're welcome to take a pause quick of
the video here to understand whiteflies in
[SPEAKER_00]: general, as well as their life cycle a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that some species of
whitefly, though, can transmit viral
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases to certain crops and have a broad
host range and colonize over 500 plant
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of this, they are an insect of
concern, and not only for the physical
[SPEAKER_00]: damage that they can do, but also the
vectoring they can do for other diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can go through six stages in about
three weeks, depending on the temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what you will find that those
temperatures are important for determining
[SPEAKER_00]: the rate of spread or increase in
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: One female can lay up to 600 eggs in her
lifetime, so it doesn't take very many to
[SPEAKER_00]: start a large population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's different species actually of
whitefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we look at them here, they all are
flies that are the color white,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this gives you, if you're seeing
something that doesn't quite match this
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly, maybe you have a silver leaf or
maybe a banded winged whitefly there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, all methods of control
generally would be the same here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just gives you a little bit more
details of some of the specific species
[SPEAKER_00]: you might be identifying in your
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, getting to those very important
beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one is Aeromonichus aerimicus,
and this is a tiny wasp that lays eggs
[SPEAKER_00]: under the whitefly larvae or pupae,
kind of what they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their life cycle takes about three weeks
to complete there, so keep that in mind as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, as well as the rates, contact,
any of the areas you might be looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing these from for some more
information on the rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this gives you a little bit more
information here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adults also kill whiteflies by feeding
on them, so a really great target for
[SPEAKER_00]: whiteflies if you have them in your
growing operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another species you might be using is
Incarcia, which is a tiny wasp there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their life cycle takes about three and a
half weeks to complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: They prioritize host and turn into black
or brownish cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: These adult Incarcia have a black or brown
head, and thorax, and a yellow abdomen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, if you're looking at, if you spread
them out and start to inspect your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe hopefully you'll see a couple of
them as far as hopefully to look out for
[SPEAKER_00]: the good beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do they go about plying these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the application is parasitized wasps
with the cheese by hanging cardboard
[SPEAKER_00]: strips, which contain the parasitized
whitefly pupae, as you can see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hung right there on the plants,
goes right over some of the stems or some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the petioles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There, it makes it really easy to apply
and really easy to go through even a large
[SPEAKER_00]: operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since this was a study, let's look at
some of their numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a slight delay in the overall
reduction in numbers, but by week nine,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was only an average of four
whiteflies per plant for the beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: insect treatment, compared to over 70 in
the control plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just make note of that slight delay in
reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think that if there's a slight
delay, you're not gonna get that final
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it just takes a little bit
longer with some of the beneficial insects
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we can see slight delay,
but there was a reduction even from week
[SPEAKER_00]: three to week five, even though not
significantly statistically different,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can see week seven and week nine
is where you really saw those beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: insects really start to reduce those
numbers in an effective way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're applying beneficial insects,
don't expect that quick next day
[SPEAKER_00]: knockdown, but the long-term benefits by
this study will certainly be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this study did look at some other
populations of insects and some other
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to check out other videos
on this channel as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a continuous reduction of all pest
species was observed throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment, approaching the zero plant
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I kind of show in the graph,
okay, right up here, maybe not reaching
[SPEAKER_00]: zero, but definitely approaching that zero
level there is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are the beneficial insects worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in short, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Study results indicate that beneficial
insects could control pest populations up
[SPEAKER_00]: to 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pest management with natural enemies is a
promising, very effective, safe method of
[SPEAKER_00]: plant protection for applicator as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind, if you are considering
these, which again, hopefully you are,
[SPEAKER_00]: proper pest identification is very
important since this will determine the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact beneficial insect to be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure those species match
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also requires frequent scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timing and rates of beneficial insects are
also important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I would recommend you consult
the people you've been purchasing these
[SPEAKER_00]: insects from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your key part is to have proper
identification so you ensure you're
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing the right insects that will do
an effective job in an environmentally
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
