[SPEAKER_00]: Many growers looking for a simple form of
irrigation go with overhead irrigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what this video is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into overhead
irrigation equipment for outdoor cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, or overhead irrigation in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at overhead irrigation,
it's a system that's a lot like a lawn
[SPEAKER_00]: sprinkler, and in small applications,
lawn sprinklers can do just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is basically pumped under pressure
and sprayed down onto the plants via a
[SPEAKER_00]: flat spray nozzle, and that can be very
small here, or very large applications we
[SPEAKER_00]: see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's maybe mounted as part of an overhead
network of aluminum pipes, or even simply
[SPEAKER_00]: mounted on this top of a stake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, depending on the size of the
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the advantages of overhead irrigation
is that it visibly confirms system
[SPEAKER_00]: uniformity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very easy for a grower to check and make
sure there's an even spread of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also offers a very large coverage
area for a relatively small number of
pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long product life, often 10 years or
greater, can be used for germination,
[SPEAKER_00]: fertigation, chemigation, and as well as
frost control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can offer short irrigation intervals
and lower maintenance costs than other
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, and this is why overhead
irrigation can be so popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's also some challenges with
overhead irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it has a higher potential for
evaporation and wind drift issues compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also waters both the crops and the
weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a general kind of
coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can not be used or is not recommended
to use with crops that are susceptible to
[SPEAKER_00]: foliar diseases, because that wetting of
the leaves can increase the odds of that
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also higher potential of runoff
and erosion compared to drip irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: when utilizing overhead irrigation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the system can be portable,
which is one of the advantages is that
[SPEAKER_00]: this can help increase the flexibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible to set up some mainline
tubing and then move the overhead
[SPEAKER_00]: sprinklers to these locations of
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can limit the number of irrigation
heads required, but can also become a
[SPEAKER_00]: hassle, which may reduce the chance of
plants getting proper amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation, especially if you have
different fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because it is possible to move
this around and go through and transport
[SPEAKER_00]: it does not mean, sadly, always the
growers will go through and do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when you're irrigating,
it ends with those hot, long summer days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there is large scale use of overhead
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So large scale operations called center
pivots are popular in the west of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mississippi River that you may have seen
without realizing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the big circles, the Pacman-like
looking things out on flying over these
[SPEAKER_00]: large expansive areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Center pivot is a big well here,
and it basically does just rotate right
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes right around in a circle format.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you're seeing with these
large what looks like crop circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're looking at calculations,
it's going to be quite simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to calculate the flow rate in
gallons per minute and then determine the
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But getting into more specifics can
increase the amount of complications,
[SPEAKER_00]: but does improve the efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a reference article here,
as well as another video I'll be going
[SPEAKER_00]: over to help you with some of those
calculations to make sure if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: choosing overhead irrigation, you're
making it as efficient as possible.
