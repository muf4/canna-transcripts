[SPEAKER_00]: This Tabaco University video will
hopefully provide you with some
[SPEAKER_00]: information about the human
endocannabinoid system, how the brain
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors as well as immune system really
relate to CB1 receptors and CB2 receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will all be explained here in
this video lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the human
cannabinoid system, focusing both on the
[SPEAKER_00]: immune system, which is really focusing on
the gland called the thalamus and the CB2
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid receptor in T cells with our
immune system, as well as the brain with
[SPEAKER_00]: the CB1 cannabinoid receptor here relating
to this whole endocannabinoid system that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be quite complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hope here is to break it down in
simple terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, understand that there are
different cannabinoids, just in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different variants of cannabinoids include
side chain, as well as a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: other ones listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see the kind of organization of
the general side chain ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot of high familiar names,
CBG, CBD, Delta-9-THC, Delta-8-THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBN, and we can see some of their
structures here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are produced not only in cannabis,
but also by species of liverworts,
[SPEAKER_00]: rhododendrons, as well as other species,
even fungi as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabinoids themselves are defined
generally as specific species of terpenoid
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules, as potential to interact with
the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically abbreviated ECS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do not forget about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we are focusing on cannabinoids,
don't forget about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also some terpenes that interact
with the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: One established example of this is the
effect of beta-chlorothalonin,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has been identified as a CB2
antagonist, acting as an logistic as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as a suppressor of neuroinflammation,
making it a candidate for the treatment of
[SPEAKER_00]: MS, or multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, we are talking about this
antagonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we are getting this
activation that occurs, and we get that
[SPEAKER_00]: full activation where drugs copy receptors
and activate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have an anti-agonist, where we
have basically no activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are blocking that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The antagonist and an agonist interacting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still get some reaction, but because
they are competing for that active site,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get a reduced activation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have no activation, full
activation, or less activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see just in this short example,
some of the complexities that do occur
[SPEAKER_00]: within these interaction systems,
particularly when we are looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting back to generally the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your own body contains a system of
endogenous receptors in ligands,
[SPEAKER_00]: which work to regulate a vast number of
cellular functions in tissues throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: your entire body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids actually play a vital role in
maintaining homeostasis in your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least two of these cannabinoids are
produced in your own body, and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: listed right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we are looking at is we have
receptors, we have our neurons,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have receptors, we have chemical
signals being released.
[SPEAKER_00]: The synapse is the gap between the neurons
and is a physical space, where they are
[SPEAKER_00]: being gone through space, and they are
being receptive here, and then inducing a
[SPEAKER_00]: response there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have certain, within our
endocannabinoid systems, we have some that
[SPEAKER_00]: are basically analogs of basically the THC
molecule, which means they basically
[SPEAKER_00]: represent a very similar shape to THC,
as well as CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this negative feedback loop,
which means in some cases, when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting this response, it will cause a
response that will kind of subdue that
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to keep having an additive
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to keep having
uncontrollable nerves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're having, in some cases,
there can be negative feedback loops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Negative, a lot of people think of it as a
bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Negative just means it's gotten the
signal, and it's suppressing more signal
[SPEAKER_00]: from being released there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that just helps the body maintain
that homeostasis, those proper internal
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, despite a changing environment
around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about that CB1 and CB2 receptor
targets, just in the general sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: CB1, or the CB, stands for cannabinoid
receptor, and cannabinoids receptor one,
[SPEAKER_00]: and cannabinoid receptor two.
[SPEAKER_00]: They determine the behavioral effects of
cannabis when consumed, as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: effects your own body's own cannabis
chemicals to AG and adamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the analogs to the
cannabis-produced signals as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, keep in mind, our CB1 targets are
looking at motor activity, thinking,
[SPEAKER_00]: appetite, short-term memory, pain
perception, as well as some involvement
[SPEAKER_00]: with immune cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: CB2 receptor targets are the gut,
the kidneys, pancreas, bones, eyes,
[SPEAKER_00]: potential tumors, immune system,
skin, as well as central and
[SPEAKER_00]: cardiovascular systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those CB2 receptors, typically located
more on immune cells, and then CB1
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors located more on the neurons
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of color codes where you're more
likely to find a CB1, or a CB2 receptor
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the CB1 receptor, just in a
little bit more detail here, they are
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed most densely in the central
nervous system, and are largely
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for mediating the effects of
cannabinoid binding within the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endocannabinoids released by
depolarization neurons bind with CB1
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors on pre-sympathetic glutamate and
GABA neurons, resulting in a receptive
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease in either glutamate or GABA
release.
[SPEAKER_00]: And GABA is just one of those hormones
involved with chemical signal
[SPEAKER_00]: transduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strong pre-symptomatic localization of
CB1 receptors, and their inhibition of
[SPEAKER_00]: voltage dependent calcium channels and
aldolent cyclase, suggest that the primary
[SPEAKER_00]: function of CB1 receptors might be to
inhibit neurotransmitter release.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I talked about that negative
feedback loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inhibiting neurotransmitter release may
not necessarily always be a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, focusing on CB1 throughout the
human body, particularly hypothalamus as
[SPEAKER_00]: shown earlier, related to memory,
appetite regulation, and emotional
[SPEAKER_00]: processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also mentioned CB2 receptors,
we can see them right here, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably found on immune cells,
particularly cells of macrophage lineage,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it has to do with your own body's
immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: These receptors only indirectly affect
neurological functions, and modulating CB2
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling could be promising for the
treatment of various inflammatory
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because CB2 receptors more peripheral
nervous system or immune system,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can be potentially to reduce
inflammation or response to diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And inflammation could be just body
inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis should
[SPEAKER_00]: be another example of effectiveness at
reducing inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, just kind of a general
summary picture here of the human
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this kind of gives you some
understanding of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the CB1 receptors are
primarily found in the brain and central
[SPEAKER_00]: nervous system, lesser extent other
tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that CBD does not directly fit
into CB1 or CB2 receptors, so that's an
[SPEAKER_00]: important note in receptors, but has
powerful indirect effects still being
[SPEAKER_00]: studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because it doesn't fit into one of
these particular receptors, it can still
[SPEAKER_00]: have an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC actually has a closer proximity
matching in shape, conformational shape to
[SPEAKER_00]: CB1 receptors, and CB2 is looking closer
resemblance to the shape of CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those CB2 receptors are mostly in the
peripheral organs, especially cells
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with the immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all great when looking at
potential for pain modulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: appetite suppression, anti-inflammatory
effects, other immune responses,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the CB1 and CB2 receptors that
naturally exist in the body and how
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds produced by cannabis plants may
influence the human endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
