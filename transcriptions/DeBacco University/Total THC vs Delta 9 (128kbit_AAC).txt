[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tobacco University video,
we're going to look at the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between total THC and delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of confusion about
what's total, what's delta 9.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully here we'll get to some
clarification between these and how delta
[SPEAKER_00]: 9 is calculated, which is very important
for legal aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding THC potency reporting,
and a lot of this has to do with the
[SPEAKER_00]: reporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first understand that the THC molecule
is natural and is actually produced in
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in its inactive form, known as
THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only a small fraction of the active delta
9 THC, typically written as here,
[SPEAKER_00]: delta 9, form is generated in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, heating the inactive THCA results
in its conversion to the active delta 9
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, only a maximum of 87.7% of the
inactive THCA can be converted to the
[SPEAKER_00]: active delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have the THCA, the inactive
form, and here we have the delta 9 THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: the psychoactive form of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are structurally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it takes heating to be able to get
to the delta 9 form of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when this comes to reporting,
what is this kind of, why is this
[SPEAKER_00]: important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in addition to reporting THCA
values, labs must now calculate the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of delta 9 that can form from THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can form is through the resulting
of heating.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where calculations come into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is this important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, THCA is converted to delta 9 upon
heating.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, THCA loses 12.3% of its weight
when converted to delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this factor into the calculations
and reporting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first you need to determine the THC
values and independently determine the
[SPEAKER_00]: values through THCA and delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to subtract 12.3% from the
THCA value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is due to the difference in THCA
and delta 9 THC molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then three, you add the delta 9 THC
and the new THCA values together to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the total THC value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that difference between the
total and the delta 9 THC values.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get these sources here are listed in
the description if you want to check them
[SPEAKER_00]: out for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm providing kind of a nice little
description here to walk you through the
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go through an example here of
this reporting and again, put some numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feel free to pause the video or look
down in the description as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find some of the slides and go
through this yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data shown here at the top right
indicates the THCA content of 24.34% and
[SPEAKER_00]: the THC or the delta 9 THC content of 0.74
in this particular example sample
[SPEAKER_00]: provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: To determine the maximum delta 9 THC that
can form from this THCA value,
[SPEAKER_00]: the THCA value must be multiplied by 0.74.
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.887.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our 24.34% THCA times that
0.877.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get 21.34, which is the maximum delta 9
THC that can form from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get the final total THC, remember
talking about the difference between delta
[SPEAKER_00]: 9 and total THC value.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the maximum delta 9 THC derived
from the THCs and is added to the value of
[SPEAKER_00]: delta 9 THC that was present in the
sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, going back here, this would be
the 21.34% that we calculated here as the
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum delta 9 THC that can be derived
from the original THCA value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we want to add that 0.74% delta 9
THC, which naturally occurs in the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: to get a total THC value of 22.08%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would see that listed right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives you kind of an example here of
the reporting and total THC calculations
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the delta 9 THC testing for hemp under
Connecticut's Public Act 19-3,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is established in August 27,
2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example, the lab may dry the
sample prior to extraction, both to
[SPEAKER_00]: convert THCA to delta 9 THC and provide a
dry weight basis for analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The analysis must be done using either of
the following methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could use gas chromatography,
the GC, or it could use high-performance
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid chromatography, HPLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with GC, this also converts the THCA
to THC during analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our analysis procedure is one test and
will result in the total delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to HPLCs, and they calculate
delta 9 THC separately from THCA using the
[SPEAKER_00]: formula listed below within their
document.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, looking at the labs processing wet
samples, labs processing wet samples will
[SPEAKER_00]: need to calculate a dry weight separately
and apply that to measurements to test
[SPEAKER_00]: results to convert to dry weight basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, it's always factored on the
dry weight basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get a wet sample, you take that
into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs processing wet samples must use a
technique capable of measuring both THCA
[SPEAKER_00]: and delta 9 THC and use the formula
present on the next slide to convert those
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA values to delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: While other metabolites of THC exist,
they only include THCA in the
[SPEAKER_00]: calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, delta 8 THC is not part of
the calculations, only delta 9.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to make that
distinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The formula to use is mentioned
previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total theoretical tetraconabidiol,
or THC, content is the maximum amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: possible delta 9 THC in a hemp crop if
total conversion were to occur and will be
[SPEAKER_00]: determined by the following calculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sum of the concentration of the
delta 9 THC in its precursor, THCA,
[SPEAKER_00]: multiplied by, again, that 0.877 on a dry
weight basis and reported to two
[SPEAKER_00]: significant figures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is the calculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That total theoretical THC equals the
concentration of delta 9 THC plus the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of THCA times that 0.877.
[SPEAKER_00]: And add those two together to get your
total theoretical THC value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of math here and
conversions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of walk your way through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I provided and that will hopefully give
you that idea of how that delta 9 THC
[SPEAKER_00]: compares to the total THC values here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the method of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now labs must indicate the method of
testing used on their certificate of
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis or COA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CMS also include a statement whether
or not the sample has delta 8,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, delta 9 THC concentration
greater than that 0.3% on a dry weight
[SPEAKER_00]: basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will determine whether they pass
or fail as being hemp or fail being above
[SPEAKER_00]: this level would then be classified
federally as marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reporting limit is defined as that 0.3
delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This includes measurements of uncertainty
determined by the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an example, if the measurement of
uncertainty is 30%, the reporting limit
[SPEAKER_00]: will be 0.39% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all samples below 0.39 will be
reported as less than 0.3%, which is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important from the federal standpoint set
by the 2018 Farm Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: The results below the reporting limit
reported as that 0.3% will pass and above
[SPEAKER_00]: that will be quarantine reported as a
status of failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from a hemp grower standpoint to make
sure that the crop they are growing is
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp, hemp is important to have this test
done to make sure that there's that
[SPEAKER_00]: certificate of analysis, that stamp of
approval, that it is truly hemp that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it passes this test here looking at
the THC levels within that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this was helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always welcome to go back and review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the description for sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, thank you for tuning in to this
other Tobacco University video.
