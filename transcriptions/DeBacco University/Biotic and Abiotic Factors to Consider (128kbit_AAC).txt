[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
we're going to go over biotic and abiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: factors to consider, providing with some
examples, as well as allowing you to do
[SPEAKER_00]: some exploration on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over some of these
factors to consider here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about biotic versus
abiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, there's two main categories
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biotic is the living, and that stands for
basically life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Abiotic is a nonliving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those biotics are all the living or
once living things in the environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and abiotic factors are all the nonliving
things in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some quick examples of biotic factors,
some pictures here.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, animals, and plants, while the
abiotic factors, rocks, water,
[SPEAKER_00]: air, but also consider wind, temperature,
and light, still fall under the abiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at this image here,
we're talking about abiotic or abiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: item in this image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Biotic, this mushroom here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about the waves of the ocean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you said abiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this rock in the foreground here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocks, these minerals would be going on
the abiotic side.
[SPEAKER_00]: This wonderful dog caught in a mid-jump
here would of course be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Biotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: A strand of DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid,
would be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Abiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking, hopefully not staring directly at
it, at least outside, directly at the sun
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun would be an example of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Abiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of combustion going on there,
a lot of fusion going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would of course be abiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sand of course being mineral based?
[SPEAKER_00]: Abiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at this virus, this particle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those that don't know, viruses are
basically DNA wrapped in a protein coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put kind of a good question here
because looking at they can multiply,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can cause severe disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what category do you classify them as?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something we'll talk about in
class.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially it might look like a leaf,
but this is actually an insect that has
[SPEAKER_00]: developed over time to look like a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now whether you saw it as a leaf or saw it
as an insect, you should classify it still
[SPEAKER_00]: as biotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all organisms are what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Biotic or abiotic?
[SPEAKER_00]: And simply put, they are all biotic there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can classify them a little bit
further as producers, consumers,
[SPEAKER_00]: or decomposers, but all of these still
fall into the category of biotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine you walk outside the school,
list as many biotic and abac factors as
[SPEAKER_00]: you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest you take a quick second,
pause the video here, jot a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: those down in each of those respective
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, hopefully you did that and
going through and what are some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things you came up for biotic factors,
living things you came up with,
[SPEAKER_00]: and hopefully some things maybe on your
list were trees, grass, birds,
[SPEAKER_00]: people, maybe someone walking their dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as your abiotic list goes,
looking at that column, hopefully that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have created, well those would be kind of
the school building, light poles,
[SPEAKER_00]: houses, cars, sidewalks, but don't forget
about sunlight, temperature, wind,
[SPEAKER_00]: things of those nature as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are all the biotic and abiotic
items in this kind of unique image there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now come up with kind of looking at the
foreground, maybe the background just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the biotic and abiotic
things there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully we can make a quick little
list there as just some more practice
[SPEAKER_00]: there, kind of a unique image,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next little trial here, you're going to
have 15 seconds to generate as many
[SPEAKER_00]: abiotic and biotic factors as you can for
the image you're about to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to step out so it doesn't look
like I'm staring at you for the 15
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds, but you're going to have 15
seconds to look at this image.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get ready and get set.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and that was time there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you came up with a list and
you can take a look and compare that in
[SPEAKER_00]: class as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always go back and review it and
hopefully you adhere to the 15 seconds
[SPEAKER_00]: there and pause the video and cheat the
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, everything we looked
at here, do biotic and abiac factors
[SPEAKER_00]: affect each other?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of a question of can
these two kind of independent categories
[SPEAKER_00]: have an impact on each other?
[SPEAKER_00]: And these you want to consider is if there
wasn't water in an area, can anything
[SPEAKER_00]: really grow and survive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you have an extremely cold winter in
those locations, will it affect animal
[SPEAKER_00]: populations in the following spring year?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are interactions that do occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your biotic factors, living factors
that affect other organisms or shapes the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So biotic factors could be predation,
food availability, competition,
[SPEAKER_00]: and disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: For abiac factors, those temperatures,
light intensity, water, soil pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral content, gases, those non-factors
can also affect organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just does get very complex depending
how much you want to get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, there are many interactions
that occur, each impacted by a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: biotic and abiotic factors with consumers,
producers, you've got primary,
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary, and tertiary kind of consumers
all playing in to the great food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully this took a very simple
category of just abiac and biotic factors
[SPEAKER_00]: and gave you a little bit greater
appreciation for the complexities involved
[SPEAKER_00]: with just this classification system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
