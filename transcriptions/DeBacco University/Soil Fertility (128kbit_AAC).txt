[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at soil fertility
and what kind of defines a soil as being
[SPEAKER_00]: fertile.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you may hear that,
this is very fertile soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's that actually mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we'll look at some more of the
details behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in particular, the definition of soil
fertility is the ability of a soil to
[SPEAKER_00]: sustain agricultural plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is by supplying essential plant
nutrients and water to allow not only the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to grow, but also reach
reproduction, reach its full life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has to occur also in the absence of
toxic substances, which may inhibit plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the higher a soil is in soil fertility,
not only is it allowing for plant growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's allowing it to reach the phase of
reproduction, but there's also an absence
[SPEAKER_00]: of harmful substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's several conditions that
contribute to soil fertility, such as root
[SPEAKER_00]: depth, drainage, soil moisture,
proper pH, and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you just a little bit of the
soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: The horizons O, or organic, is at the very
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: A is very near the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: The B is the subsoil, which is pretty much
the extent at which the roots will reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: C, the substratum, is where roots are not
going to reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then R we have as bedrock here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, looking particularly at root depth,
sufficient soil depth for adequate root
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and water retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure that the soil is
not just very shallow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can cause some issues with plants as
they develop their roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: See kind of a profile here of a soil,
and this is a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can kind of see that root depth
doesn't quite go as far as some may think,
[SPEAKER_00]: but is definitely taking up a large area,
allowing for adequate nutrient and water
[SPEAKER_00]: absorption, as well as anchoring this
plant in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good drainage is providing aeration
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a pitchfork being plunged into
the soil here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can kind of break the soil here and
help increase aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots need to respire.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to take in oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to breathe to grow properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want them soaking in water
for long periods of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For most plants, that's not going to be
good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be evidence of poor soil
fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have soil moisture, so we do need to
have some moisture in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is soil in the root zone needs to
maintain a proper moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means it's not waterlogged or it's
not too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have that nice, even amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: The physical properties of the soil can
impact this, such as the particle size
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many large or small particles does it
have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of that sandy, that clay,
gravel-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can really impact the ability for
soil to maintain moisture levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the proper soil pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soil pH in the range of six to seven,
and favoring that slightly acidic to
[SPEAKER_00]: neutral is preferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, again, speaking for most plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple plants, for example,
blueberries, if you're growing them,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're looking at much more of the acidic
range here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Asparagus can tolerate soils above seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just looking at this pH range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, right around neutral,
most nutrients are available to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where most are going to prefer,
six to seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrients that support plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the optimum rates of nutrients
that are plant-available.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this term, plant-available,
means is that the plant can take them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some soils, for different properties or
different issues, may have a high amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of nutrients in them, but they might hear
the term called their locked-up nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nutrients that aren't able to be
pulled out by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have that maximum growth,
maximum yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have those nutrients being
highly plant-available, which often is
[SPEAKER_00]: provided through a proper pH of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple things that help contribute
to the term soil fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
