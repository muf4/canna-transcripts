[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have heard that they're going
to get the autopsy results from a victim
[SPEAKER_00]: or a body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what does that exactly mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well here at Tobacco University with this
video of autopsy basics, we're going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: over some of the background regarding
autopsies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, an autopsy in general,
it's basically an internal medical
[SPEAKER_00]: examination of a body used to determine
the cause and circumstances of the death.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the entire goal of performing or
conducting an autopsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind that there are two
different terms that sometimes used
[SPEAKER_00]: interchangeably and they really shouldn't
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is a medical examiner and one is a
coroner.
[SPEAKER_00]: A medical examiner is a government
official, which is always a physician and
[SPEAKER_00]: often a forensics pathologist in charge
with the investigating sudden and
[SPEAKER_00]: unexpected deaths or deaths from injuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The coroner is an elected official with
death investigation duties that signs the
[SPEAKER_00]: death certificate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind these are distinctly
different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's a government official, one's an
elected official and they have very
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctive and different backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these terms should not be used
interchangeably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now death is defined as, and this is what
we're trying to determine here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of life, to put it simply.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's characterized by stopping of blood
circulation and brain activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the heart stops beating, oxygen is
deprived from the body and the cells will
[SPEAKER_00]: begin to die at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once enough cells die, life cannot be
restarted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at, this is how we're
defining death here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of autopsies, so the whole point
of providing them is to try to determine
[SPEAKER_00]: the manner of death, which is the means by
which the person perished, the cause of
[SPEAKER_00]: death, which is the reason why they died,
the mechanism of death, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: specific body failure that may have
occurred, and the time of death,
[SPEAKER_00]: referring to when the person actually
died.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the manner of death, there's different
categories it can be placed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be natural, if this is caused
or determined to be caused by disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer, physical injury, stroke,
or heart attack, and it occurred only or
[SPEAKER_00]: solely by those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's accidental, if it occurs
without apparent intent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's suicide of cause by the deceased
person or individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Homicide is defined as if someone other
than deceased caused it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have suicide and homicide
examples, such as shooting, burning,
[SPEAKER_00]: poisoning, hanging, drowning, or
suffocation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all kind of manner of death
examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Categories that the autopsy could classify
a death as.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we have causes of death, which there
are many, and this is the simple reason
[SPEAKER_00]: why they died.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just see annually number of deaths
caused in the world in 2016, right above
[SPEAKER_00]: me, with cardiovascular disease and
cancers being at the very top of the list
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can kind of see everything else,
again, projected all those numbers in
[SPEAKER_00]: millions of deaths annually, looking at
the world population for the year 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see have a little zoomed in
version here, the top 10 global causes of
[SPEAKER_00]: death for 2016, again, expressed in
millions of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get the mechanism of death.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the mechanism of death here is
we're trying to describe the specific
[SPEAKER_00]: change in the body that brought about the
cessation of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the kind of the method at which
that occurred?
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone has been shot, they may have
died from loss of blood, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone dies of a heart attack,
they may die from pulmonary arrest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if someone is strangled, they may die
from asphyxiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is looking at the mechanism of
death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a sample kind of death
certificate just provided here,
[SPEAKER_00]: just so you can kind of get an idea of
what's included there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, we have the time of death.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times forensic investigators
are trying to estimate or determine what
[SPEAKER_00]: time this was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is simply when the person
actually died.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can help determine who to include
or to exclude based on alibis or location
[SPEAKER_00]: at a certain day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's such a crucial part of the
investigation process to try to determine
[SPEAKER_00]: and pinpoint that time of death even has
to be estimated with as great degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: accuracy, given the information that can
be gathered and collected.
