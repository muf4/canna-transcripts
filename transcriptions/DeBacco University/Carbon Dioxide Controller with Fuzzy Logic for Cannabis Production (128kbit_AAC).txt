[SPEAKER_00]: Here on Tobacco University, I'm going to
cover a controller that has Fuzzy Logic
[SPEAKER_00]: and some things you should know about it
and how you should best utilize it in your
[SPEAKER_00]: growing space.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into carbon dioxide
controller with Fuzzy Logic for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, probably important to know
is just simply what is Fuzzy Logic and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of use this term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what does it actually mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this Fuzzy Logic is an internal
program that utilizes dosing duration and
[SPEAKER_00]: changes in carbon dioxide levels to
calculate how to most efficiently maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: the preset target level of carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is for the controller to not
largely over or under dose from the target
[SPEAKER_00]: present preset level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's kind of a graphical analysis of
what this looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, initially we may have some dosing
that occurs and it overshoots and it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: below and overshoots and kind of goes
through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we implement Fuzzy Logic,
we can see that the swings in the total
[SPEAKER_00]: duration that spends over or below the set
point start to get reduced over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the controller learning the
conditions, learning the growing area,
[SPEAKER_00]: learning the rate of dosing and getting
more dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also notice that the frequency tends
to increase to little short durations,
[SPEAKER_00]: little pulses can be a great way for that
controller to learn your growth space and
[SPEAKER_00]: to efficiently dose with carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the limitations of this Fuzzy
Logic?
[SPEAKER_00]: These gradual adjustments that you see are
specific to the growth space and make
[SPEAKER_00]: these controllers very efficient at
delivering carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why you typically pay a little
bit more for these.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can reduce the potential for wasting
carbon dioxide and limit the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle changes that needs to be made while
still maintaining near target levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only are you extending the life of
your bottle, you're also maintaining the
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions closer to that preset target
that you've set.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this cannot be used with carbon
dioxide generators.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only works with bottle or liquid fed
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generators are only on and off and unlike
the pulse dosing that can occur with the
[SPEAKER_00]: compressed tank of carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see example of that here,
the pulse dosing, some are longer,
[SPEAKER_00]: some are shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically the controller dialing
in and making sure it's staying within
[SPEAKER_00]: that target range, ideally staying within
the dead band that you've set,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the amount of tolerance you have
to be above or below your actual set
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we set that dead band?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we set that kind of target level
above or below?
[SPEAKER_00]: This setting decides how tight you want
the controller to keep carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: levels to the target set point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially how far the controller will
allow the carbon dioxide levels to deviate
[SPEAKER_00]: from the chosen setting before triggering
carbon dioxide source to switch on or off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The default for most systems is around 50
parts per million for most controllers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a good general setting for
bottle based systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selecting 50 parts per million as your
dead band setting will allow your gross
[SPEAKER_00]: base levels to be over or below by 50
parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before the controller were turned on or
off the dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other growers wanted something a little
bit tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see this one set here to be 25
parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to set it too tight because
otherwise the controller will struggle to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of keep it within that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it too large because then
you'll have large swings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 50 is usually the starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel everything's going good, you can
adjust it from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your sensor for whatever system
you're using has the presence of a
[SPEAKER_00]: photocell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you want a photocell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this will help ensure that the
carbon dioxide is only added during the
[SPEAKER_00]: light period, which is only when the
plants can actually utilize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A time could be used if you have a
regiment light schedule, but photocell is
[SPEAKER_00]: generally a fail safe option to ensure
carbon dioxide is only added when plants
[SPEAKER_00]: can use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some base systems have like an on off time
that you could set, but really most
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers now are going over to
photocells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you adjust the light duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in indoor growing, the carbon
dioxide system will automatically adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're growing in an outdoor
location or a cold frame, the photocell
[SPEAKER_00]: can adjust to the either lengthening or
decreasing duration of sunlight that you
[SPEAKER_00]: might be getting based on seasonal
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, what can this system do?
[SPEAKER_00]: It can maximize the yield of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the course of a growing cycle,
cannabis plants will become many times
[SPEAKER_00]: larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, having a controller that will
adjust to these conditions will
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically ensure efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: As those plants get larger, carbon dioxide
consumption could increase and having this
[SPEAKER_00]: fuzzy logic can help, again, maintain
those levels despite these changes that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be occurring to ensure you have a
very efficient grow locking operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
