[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at
something you probably have heard of
[SPEAKER_00]: before and are familiar with but may not
fully understand, and that's the topic of
[SPEAKER_00]: pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be familiar with the pH scale
from 0 to 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acids are the lower end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bases are the higher end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neutral is 7, which is pure water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certain indicators that will turn
different colors based on pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to try to understand it from a
molecular level now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first off, to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH, what does that even stand for?
[SPEAKER_00]: It equals the potential of hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This scale is logarithmic, meaning it's
not linear, and we're going to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: impact each of these pH numbers mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used to determine the acidity or
basicity of water based on an aqueous
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also something called pOH,
which is the potential for hydroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, potential for hydrogen pH,
that's referring to hydrogen here,
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroxide is OH.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the opposite of pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, pH plus pOH equals 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our 0 to 14 scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if we take a pH at the bottom here of
7, 7 plus what equals 14?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, 7 plus 7 is 14, so the pH is 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the pOH is also 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, anywhere else is where it starts
to get a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something we may consider an acid,
for example, pH of 2, kind of right around
[SPEAKER_00]: near stomach acid, very acidic,
very strong acid, pH of 2, that same
[SPEAKER_00]: substance is going to have a pOH of 12,
because 2 plus 12 will give us 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing if we look at a basic solution
here, pH of 10 is going to have a pOH of
[SPEAKER_00]: 4, because again, 10 plus 4 equals 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on with our acids and bases,
an acid is a substance that increases the
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen ion concentration in a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, our acids here are pH 0 to just under
7, hydrochloric acid, lemon juice,
[SPEAKER_00]: grapefruit juice, tomato juice,
usually soft drink, urine, saliva,
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee, soda, vinegar, all of these are
examples of acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I try to put here is as the pH
decreases, as we get more acidic here,
[SPEAKER_00]: as this decreases, the hydrogen ion will
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, these stronger pHs, these lower pH
levels, will have higher concentration of
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bases, any substance that reduces the
hydrogen ion concentration in a solution
[SPEAKER_00]: is a base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some bases reduce hydrogen ions directly
by accepting hydrogen ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examples of base solutions here,
again, they just happen to be at the top,
[SPEAKER_00]: would be baking soda, pH around 9.5,
bleaches, drain cleaners, ammonias,
[SPEAKER_00]: sea water is actually slightly basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are examples of solutions that are
basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the pH scale, as I said, the pH is an
aqueous solution of the hydrogen ion
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration times the hydroxide
concentration, equal 10 to the minus 14
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This measures the degree of acidity from
that 0 to 14 scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: In relation to biology, most biological
fluids are in the pH range of 6 to 8,
[SPEAKER_00]: and each pH unit represents a 10-fold
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scale is logarithmic.
[SPEAKER_00]: A small change in pH actually indicates a
substantial change in hydrogen ion and
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroxide ion concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what does that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: We look right over here, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at pH of 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our hydrogen ion is 0.1.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice we move that decimal point one
point to the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go another pH point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have to move that another
10-fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we can see that this is a logarithm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not linear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a logarithmic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this massive increase in change in
the correlation of pH values to hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: ion concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as from 3 to 5, it's only 2 pH
differences, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only a pH difference of 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, we're moving it 10-fold each
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, 10, 100 times more acidic is pH 3 to
pH 5.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something called strong acids and
strong bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strong acids and bases completely dissolve
in water, as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: HCl dissolving completely into hydrogen
ions and chloride ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sodium hydroxide, same there, into sodium
ions and hydroxide ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, there's something
called weak acids and weak bases,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these dissociate only partially and
kind of are reversible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if we go back to the strong acids,
we'll notice that the arrow goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we have this kind of state of
equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: The arrow is going this way, and these are
kind of slipping back.
[SPEAKER_00]: These hydrogen ions are rebinding,
and it's going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of a weak acid,
and this is a weak base because it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't just go to completion in one
way and completely dissociate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, water is both an acid and a base,
which seems initially a little confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we take a strong acid,
such as hydrochloric acid, and add it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the same concentration of a base,
in this case, sodium hydroxide,
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually get, it's called a double
replacement, we get water and salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get salt water base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, from a very strong acid to a
very strong base.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why it's both an acid and a
base is we see it's in equilibrium here.
[SPEAKER_00]: H2O is going back and forth between
hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, ideally, in pure water, this will be
an even kind of split, and this will give
[SPEAKER_00]: us a pH of seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we increase the hydrogen ions,
we then create an acidic solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we can see here's our H.
[SPEAKER_00]: HOH is the same as H2O.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here, here's our sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is kind of giving you an idea of
how these bonds can switch places and give
[SPEAKER_00]: us very different end substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH scale is the concentration of hydrogen
ions in a given substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH equals the negative log of hydrogen
ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we can see here, a pH of seven,
we have an equal number of hydrogen ions
[SPEAKER_00]: and hydroxide ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we increase the acidity, we notice the
hydrogen ion percent is vastly increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the same opposite will happen if we
increase the basicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hydroxide ions will increase here.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, it stays in a nice box, and that's
how it always comes to equal 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take our pH and add it to our POH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, developing a problem here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, how much greater is the hydrogen ion
concentration in a solution with pH two
[SPEAKER_00]: than a solution with pH six?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're looking at hydrogen ion
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our pHs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go through how we're going to solve
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the answer here is that pH of two has
a hydrogen ion concentration of one
[SPEAKER_00]: hundredth molar.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH of six, hydrogen ion concentration of
one times ten to the minus six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we'll notice it's a much smaller
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: One millionth here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, how do we get this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, by using the log function,
you need a calculator to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do a couple examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have ten to the minus two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the two is indicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The six is to the minus six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that the difference between
these two numbers is ten thousand times
[SPEAKER_00]: greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two to six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when people say, oh, pH of two or six,
well, it's still an acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two to six, two, three, four, five,
six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's only like four-ish different pH
units.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually ten thousand times greater
hydrogen ion concentration of pH two
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can see this makes a large
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buffers are very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are substances that resist the
change in pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buffers help organisms maintain the pH of
the body fluids in a narrow range
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: The combinations of hydrogen ions,
acceptors, and donors form a solution of
[SPEAKER_00]: weak acids and bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's buffering the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This works by accepting hydrogen ions from
solution when they're in excess in
[SPEAKER_00]: donating hydrogen ions when they have been
depleted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what's happening with a buffer?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of helping reduce the large
swings that may occur in solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see distilled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost no buffering solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We add a little bit of volume of NOH added
to add like one drop and we see the pH
[SPEAKER_00]: jump up drastically.
[SPEAKER_00]: In buffered solutions, we see that pH
maintain a much more consistent range and
[SPEAKER_00]: only slow slowly increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a buffer is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, slowing or reducing the massive
differences or swings pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important, for example,
for blood pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our normal pH is between seven point three
four and seven point three eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH of seven or seven eight, we're getting
into very dangerous ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH of six or nine of blood pH leads to
death.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's important we have buffers
to help maintain this normal pH in this
[SPEAKER_00]: tight range so that we can allow us to
survive and allow our proteins to function
[SPEAKER_00]: properly and allow us to be able to carry
out our normal bodily functions.
Thank you.
