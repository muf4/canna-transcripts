[SPEAKER_00]: This is intended to be a short comparison
between natural selection and genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So natural selection here, we have our two
moths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And genetic engineering, we're modifying
the genes of an organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start off here, natural selection over
time, selecting for one particular trait,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically based on the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have the birds eating the green
bugs here that stand out against the brown
[SPEAKER_00]: tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brown bugs are able to survive,
and they're the ones that are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: pass on the genes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're more or less survive through
the process of natural selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're naturally being selected for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example here, pretty complex,
but over time, selecting for one
[SPEAKER_00]: particular trait, again, typically based
on phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Modern corn comes from something called
teosinte.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teosinte here we see compared to a quarter
as a corn plant, but it is a highly
[SPEAKER_00]: branched corn plant that produces these
very small, almost single in a row seed
[SPEAKER_00]: ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the process of natural selection,
people have cultivated corn to grow one
[SPEAKER_00]: main central stalk and to produce large
ears of corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here the comparison of our
modern corn versus our teosinte,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ancestor of corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was through cultivation and through
being able to feed people and being more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient at food production, the modern
corn essentially was developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've then gone to the next step and
genetically engineered it, but just the
[SPEAKER_00]: corn in general that we're genetically
modifying is the result of many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many generations of natural selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically genetic engineering,
it's a deliberate modification of an
[SPEAKER_00]: organism by manipulating the genetic
material based on the genotype of an
[SPEAKER_00]: organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since all the genes in DNA is a,
you know, a universal code, we're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: take those genes and modify them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking the genes for a red pigment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make bacteria, bananas,
clovers, and frogs all red by simply
[SPEAKER_00]: inserting the red pigment gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the mice with glowing eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're genetically modifying this
particular mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see what one looks like,
kind of in real life, we have a green
[SPEAKER_00]: glowing mouse, a YouTube video link
provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this clarifies a little bit
about natural selection versus genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering and what each individually
does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
