[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to go over the role of silica in
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, a study, as well as applying it to
your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into using silica for
cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to start with, silica is regarded
as a jack of all trades when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some even refer to this nutrient as a
super vitamin for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is critical to any grow room,
especially in soils hydroponic operation,
[SPEAKER_00]: simply because silica is found in high
concentrations in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what is the role of silica in plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see a nice little example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silica does make plants stronger,
bigger, and more hearty, at least
[SPEAKER_00]: according to the marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the specific reasons growers use
silica supplements are for stronger cell
[SPEAKER_00]: walls, bigger and stronger stems,
increased resistance to environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: stresses, as well as pathogens and pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also improved metabolic functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, kind of the premise of how it works,
well, if you don't have silica or low
[SPEAKER_00]: silica in plants, we could see a fungal
spore kind of lands here on the cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant cell, and it's easily able to
penetrate into that epidermal or outer
[SPEAKER_00]: layer cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if there was a silica layer that
kind of creates this kind of harder outer
[SPEAKER_00]: barrier, and the fungi may not be able to
penetrate into that epidermal cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: preventing it from infecting the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at silica,
and improved disease resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at kind of comparing some
strawberries, and this study further
[SPEAKER_00]: showed to infer the host pathogen
recognition, probably by preventing
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling molecules from finding their
specific targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this example, you're kind of getting
that communication disruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silica was also suggested to induce
indirect defense mechanisms by altering
[SPEAKER_00]: composition of herbivore induced plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under high tunnel strawberry plants
accumulated as much as 3% dry waste
[SPEAKER_00]: silica, which resulted in significant
reduction of powdery mildew severity and
[SPEAKER_00]: higher yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, strawberry plants grown
in soil were unable to absorb silica,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether amended in liquid or solid form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that it is going to be
substrate specific as far as how much
[SPEAKER_00]: better benefits you might see or might not
see compared to a control plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how should silica be added if we're
looking at considering adding this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it should be utilized throughout the
entire life of the plants from seedling to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydroponics systems can rely more heavily
on silica supplementation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also useful to supplement plants
grown in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, keep in mind that if you are
going to choose to add a silica product,
[SPEAKER_00]: it does take time to accumulate in the
plants and should not be done one time
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding to get its true benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: To build up that outer layer, to build up
that protective layer, it does take
[SPEAKER_00]: repeated feedings to be able for that to
accumulate in the plant so you can get the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits felt and resulting of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're going through and applying
silica, well, there's many different
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers, many different companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silica can be applied either as a root
feed or as a foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Studies have shown that it can absorb a
little bit more through foliar feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: than through the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the root zone does have uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless of how you apply the silica,
it's important to note that silica can
[SPEAKER_00]: raise the pH of your nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as stated in the product labels,
growers are advised to add this product
[SPEAKER_00]: first to their nutrient feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, do not directly mix any
concentrates together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've shown you two kind of examples
here, Agrisil 16H and Denigro Protect are
[SPEAKER_00]: just examples of two silica products.
[SPEAKER_00]: One in a powdered form with the kind of
list of recipes right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one's a liquid form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often they're done in comparison because
this is a liquid form.
[SPEAKER_00]: The powdered form you can mix up as you
need it and you're not paying or needing
[SPEAKER_00]: to store water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this just compares these two
versions of potassium silicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this is helpful to your growing
situation.
