[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to explore a little
bit about outdoor cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a prime image of that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cannabis is being grown outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be considered in raised beds,
where they're each in their own separate
[SPEAKER_00]: container, and they're on pallets to help
drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with outdoor production, there's some
similarities, but there can also be some
[SPEAKER_00]: variability in exactly how a grower
chooses to go about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, in general, outdoor
production offers the least overall cost
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually produce the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very efficient method of production
because there's no need for lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can utilize natural soil, and that may
only require amendments instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: basically starting from scratch,
as some indoor grower operations have to
[SPEAKER_00]: go through and do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Factors to consider when growing outdoors,
there's climate, there's soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's pests, and there's neighbors or
what we call promiscuous pollen that may
[SPEAKER_00]: be in the area there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking first at climate, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Agriculture Hardiness Zone
Map is a great place to start,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at your particular region.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to realize there might be
microclimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This only gives you a general idea of what
to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see near coastal areas or
large bodies of water, there can be
[SPEAKER_00]: moderation in those temperatures compared
to those that might be far away or at
[SPEAKER_00]: higher elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why, if you follow this degree
of latitude, it may not always match up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're kind of looking here,
you can see there's a lot of variability,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the West Coast being much warmer,
and then that same degree of latitude here
[SPEAKER_00]: in kind of the middle part of the country,
and here in the Rocky Mountains also a
[SPEAKER_00]: great degree of variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, cannabis is not frost tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, frost is 32 degrees
Fahrenheit or zero degrees Celsius and
[SPEAKER_00]: lower, and that will kill a cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to keep these frost
concerns in mind early and late in the
[SPEAKER_00]: season for growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walls of waters is what they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be used early in the season to
protect young seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very labor-intensive, but it doesn't
require any heat to be added.
[SPEAKER_00]: These water tubes basically heat up with
the sun's energy and give back some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that heat during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a time investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be unpractical on very large
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remaise style covers are best suited for
long rows and acts as kind of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: blanket to help protect tender vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, only a heated greenhouse can
help protect the crop if temperatures drop
[SPEAKER_00]: below 30 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, they'll get up in the morning
and they'll look kind of melted or black
[SPEAKER_00]: or damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to kind of rely on these
structures to get them through and start
[SPEAKER_00]: them too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: These should be great if you kind of have
that one kind of oddly cold night in the
[SPEAKER_00]: early part or late part of the growing
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different soil types to
consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clay, sand, loam, and many distinctions
between those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil testing is highly advised and
recommended for both nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: texture, which can tell you a lot about a
growing site, especially if it's a rented
[SPEAKER_00]: or new field to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should also give you an idea if it's worth
pursuing the location if estimated cost
[SPEAKER_00]: would be too high to amend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make anything we kind of need to,
but in order to get this soil to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: produce this, it might be cost
prohibitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to prepare the soil, the ideal time
is in the fall to allow time for pH
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustments in particular if it's
necessary and give time for the breakdown
[SPEAKER_00]: of amendments that may be added so they
can become plant available in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still can be adjusted in the spring,
but large changes need to equilibrate over
[SPEAKER_00]: time, which can limit potential damage to
the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the earlier you can plan something,
the earlier you can have that soil test
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The earlier you can adjust that pH,
the better your plant will be the
[SPEAKER_00]: following season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic matter is carbon-based components
of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here being turned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's chicken we have, like, newer and
straw would be examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This often gets a lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be raised to very high levels with
excessive compost additions.
[SPEAKER_00]: More is not better necessary with organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important for water holding capacity,
but too much water holding capacity and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients can cause more harm than good.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been known to burn their
plants with excessive additions of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it can hold too much water in that
area or roots can become waterlogged.
[SPEAKER_00]: For large field application, there's
something called a hard pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this is is soil compacted below the
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just kind of scratch the
surface, it might be great, but there
[SPEAKER_00]: could be this hard pan layer located below
that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be an issue with where heavy
equipment's being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can occur it shows being worked when it
was too wet or an area has been plowed
[SPEAKER_00]: excessively.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have that issue there of that
hard pan or that plow pan layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this is is it creates a layer that
doesn't allow natural percolation of water
[SPEAKER_00]: and can daily impact root development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something to be mindful of.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at potential site and
dig a hole, use penetrometers or ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of assess the degree or presence of a
hard pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now raised bed growing, again,
this is still outdoor production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raised bed is an example of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage is they warm up really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is at a height that's easier to
work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can control what goes in the actual
box as far as amendments or soil or adding
[SPEAKER_00]: vermiculite or perlite or something else,
a special mix that you want to add.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the negative effects with a
raised bed are that the soil can often get
[SPEAKER_00]: too warm in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see here, shade netting has
been used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can increase irrigation frequency,
the time and resources it takes to
[SPEAKER_00]: construct them, and they're kind of fixed
in place once established.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not very easy to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a well-established area,
by all means, growing beds or raised beds
[SPEAKER_00]: might be a quality option for you,
but you do kind of consider the pros and
[SPEAKER_00]: cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now growing in a field or outdoor in
general, typically weeds are a concern and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's many options for weed suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use plastic, which is the easiest,
often the cheapest, but the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: season disposal can be a challenge or
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's biodegradable plastic mulches that
can reduce waste at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's variable results with more field
trash that may be wanted, meaning there
[SPEAKER_00]: could be particulate left at the end of
the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's natural, which can be wood-based,
can be expensive, can also harbor pests
[SPEAKER_00]: from year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Landscape fabric, as we see here,
can be very expensive initially,
[SPEAKER_00]: but can last for many seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be a good option once you can
afford or justify the initial investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor growing, just like other sites,
you need to consider fertilizers and
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically drip irrigation is the only
feasible method for long distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incorporating an injector such as a
Dosatron or Dosmatic here is recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can also fertilize the crop over a
large area efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wind protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strong winds can break plants,
can also increase daily water
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is not to stop the wind entirely,
but to kind of break it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Privacy fence or shade netting is a good
option to help kind of break up some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that wind, which is better than a solid
plastic or vinyl fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of creates areas where a lot of
pressure can occur or can get swirling
[SPEAKER_00]: winds that can also damage plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Staking and trellising and supporting
plants can help reduce the potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: wind damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to watch out for wild animals,
you are growing outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every animal, including some humans,
you want to investigate or harm your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider fencing operations that either
have a physical metal fence, as this does
[SPEAKER_00]: here, or electrified off potential
animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metal is a permanent fixture, but some
animals can climb over or dig under it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A downfall to an electrical fence,
it needs to be kept clear of weeds so that
[SPEAKER_00]: power can be kept to it for the entire
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insects of concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep a careful eye out for
insects that may feed on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some can also transmit diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to monitor plants and catch pests
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some can be very small, as we see with
thrips and whiteflies and aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be really inspecting your
plants well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, promiscuous pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know thy neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know if someone else is
growing plants that are growing for
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding purposes or could be pollen in
the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your goal is not to pollinate cannabis
plants because you want your female plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce cannabinoids and not seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weather and prevailing winds may carry
pollen a few feet to even many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to consider early or late
planting dates to prevent unintentional
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: High amounts of moisture in the air can
reduce pollen's ability to reach or
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate a female flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where potential misting or
overhead irrigation systems may come into
[SPEAKER_00]: play to reduce the chance that your
outdoor growing field gets mis-pollinated
[SPEAKER_00]: by a local area that may be breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also important if you have a high
tunnel that you're growing male plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have that pollen go out
into the field because it will mess up the
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency and protection of your entire
field crop.
Thank you.
