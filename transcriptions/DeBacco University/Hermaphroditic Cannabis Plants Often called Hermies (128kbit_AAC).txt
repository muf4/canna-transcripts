[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
we're going to be going over
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphroditic cannabis plants and what to
look for on how to visually identify them
[SPEAKER_00]: as being producing both a combination of
male and female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can see in the image here,
we see some definite female structures,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we also can see some male structures
on this same plant mixed within the same
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we call a hermaphroditic
plant, sometimes often called Hermes in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So visually recognizing a hermaphroditic
plant is important because they contain
[SPEAKER_00]: both male and female sex organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very common, at least in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some strains have a greater odds of
producing hermaphroditic plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also plants under stress may also
increase the odds of producing this
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of male and female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These hermaphroditic plants can sometimes
self-pollinate since both pollen and
[SPEAKER_00]: ovaries will be produced on the same
plant, assuming they open at the same time
[SPEAKER_00]: to allow the pollen to be received by the
female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, herming out due to stress is
sometimes what some growers will say,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this can be an example of when there's
heavy plant damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be plant damage that is
accidental, or it could be induced by
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also environmental stresses such
as water stress, salt stress in the root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone, or simply the plant becoming root
bound in its growing container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's also nutrient deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also induce a stress on the plant
that could increase the odds of producing
[SPEAKER_00]: both male and female flowers in the same
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to monitor our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when plants are exposed to known
stresses, this should be an indicator for
[SPEAKER_00]: growers to do an extra scout for flower
identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor stress examples is making sure the
temperature doesn't get too high,
[SPEAKER_00]: watching our light intensities.
[SPEAKER_00]: For outdoor applications, this would be
physical damage to a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be grower-induced, but it could
also be wind damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be physical damage due to wind
breaking branches or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know the genetics of some strains that
tend to have more hermaphroditic
[SPEAKER_00]: tendencies and should be removed once
identified to avoid the chance of causing
[SPEAKER_00]: that pollination to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, what are you actually looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you want to look at both the buds
and pollen sacs, the same plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes within the same flower cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a definite strong female plant
identification, but we also see that
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen sac also developing here within
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of a hermaphroditic
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this allows you to kind of
get a developing understanding of just
[SPEAKER_00]: what a hermaphroditic plant is and what to
visually look for within your own plants.
