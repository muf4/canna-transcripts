[SPEAKER_00]: Looking to enrich your growing area with
carbon dioxide and using propane or
[SPEAKER_00]: natural gas as the source for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here at Tobacco University, we're going to
describe this exact situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the video using
propane or natural gas as carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: source for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, just a general word of
caution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these units can be a potential
fire hazard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So caution when you're using these units
maybe need adjustment to reduce the chance
[SPEAKER_00]: of contaminants being released into the
grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example, ethylene and carbon monoxide can
be added through incomplete combustion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when using propane, for example,
does come with these warnings should be
[SPEAKER_00]: this should be on the propane tank that
you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was complete combustion,
propane combined with oxygen will simply
[SPEAKER_00]: produce carbon dioxide and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the carbon dioxide to help the
plants grow, but water will help will
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if there's incomplete combustion,
we still have propane with combining with
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will still produce carbon dioxide and
water, but there also will be free carbons
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as carbon monoxide, two things
that we don't want to have in the gross
[SPEAKER_00]: space because we're not getting that pure
or high percentage transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, specialized natural gas burners,
this is what they would look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are categories as an unvented
heater, and they have that nice kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: blue glow to the flame indicating it's
burning very hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding heat to the growing environment,
which can be advantageous in colder
[SPEAKER_00]: months, but be aware that plants can only
utilize the carbon dioxide during the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights on cycle of the photosynthetic
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, direct fired heaters is another
example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intake outside combustion air,
they have improved efficiency and safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: These units will produce carbon dioxide
and heat at the same time, and they've
[SPEAKER_00]: been utilized in a lot of greenhouse and
growing situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another consideration if you're
looking at increasing carbon dioxide to
[SPEAKER_00]: your growing facility and helping to
increase plant production overall.
Thank you very much.
