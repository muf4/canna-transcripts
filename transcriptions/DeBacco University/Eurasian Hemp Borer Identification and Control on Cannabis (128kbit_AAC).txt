[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this DeBacco University video,
I'm going to be covering the Eurasian Hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: Borer proper identification and control as
it relates to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we can see pictures of the same
plant here when cut away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly there is an insect in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is identified as the Eurasian Hemp
Borer and we're going to go through how to
[SPEAKER_00]: properly identify it in a plant and also
how to go about control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, just a general description.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Eurasian Hemp Borer can have negative
impacts on cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's documented as an economic importance
for fiber production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Economic threshold is 10 larvae per plant
due to reduction in plant growth and seed
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is that it borers into the
stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is a cut away of the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see definitely a necrotic region
here, blackened region.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it probably entered and is
eating away at the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The base of a bud here, but it is eating
away at the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's internal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we go about identifying the
Eurasian Hemp Borer?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see here just some of the
adult Eurasian Hemp Borer moths.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see the pupa evident here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're going through and
identifying or proper identification of
[SPEAKER_00]: the borer, it has a distinctive
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a pinkish, whitish, pale brown
larvae with several barely visible pale
[SPEAKER_00]: bristles at the body segments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eurasian Hemp Borer are small,
78 millimeters compared to the corn
[SPEAKER_00]: earworm, which is much larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to confuse the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier larval instars are difficult to
distinguish from the background as they're
[SPEAKER_00]: whitish and cream colored, as we saw in
that first image.
[SPEAKER_00]: May have two to three generations in the
southern United States, so be aware of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The head is a yellowish to brown
coloration and can be dark to black.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have light detecting very simple
eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The late larval instar in the fall is the
overwintering stage and can have an orange
[SPEAKER_00]: to reddish coloration, kind of as we see
down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stage passes the winter in well
sheltered places such as folded leaves or
[SPEAKER_00]: tunneled into stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tunneling may cause some stunting and
distortion of the stems and stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adults merge during the spring after
mating and they start to lay eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the absence of hemp, they can feed on
hops and knotweed and probably other weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adults are small moths, as we see right
here, displaying white stripes in their
[SPEAKER_00]: front edges and four chevron-like stripes
near the center when they're expanded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the adult, this kind of shows that
kind of a little bit more zoomed in
[SPEAKER_00]: version of the adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are commonly spread to new locations
via infested hemp seeds or debris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivar selection may be important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild hemp in Vermont seems to have innate
resistance to the pests compared to that
[SPEAKER_00]: wild hemp in the Midwest United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of an interesting discovery
there, at least initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what to look for on the actual plants
is the larva of the infested moth borrows
[SPEAKER_00]: into the stem of the hemp plants making
tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it looks like we have some
wilting going on here and some browning,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really that internal portion that is
of concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also feed on the leaves and later
in the season attack seeds as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see this dieback, go through and
investigate the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have to do a little cutaway and
you might find one of these hemp borrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you go about managing the hemp
borrower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the first step should be cleaning,
pruning, and disposing of infested plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember this insect lives in the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is of increased importance if
cannabis will be grown in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: location the following year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Removal of wild weeds is also recommended
to eliminate alternate hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insecticide application effectiveness is
reduced to the fact that the immature
[SPEAKER_00]: stages live inside the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very difficult to control them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Systemic products are often not registered
or recommended and that's what it would
[SPEAKER_00]: take to get to the actual location where
this hemp borrower is located.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives you some good information
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you don't see it, but if you do,
you're able to properly identify and start
[SPEAKER_00]: to implement control measures.
