[SPEAKER_00]: So wood is a common heat source,
but here at Tobacco University,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to look at using wood to heat
a cannabis grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to use wood to heat your
grow facility, let's go over some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: details with that and considerations you
should be making.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, wood heat just in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wood is relatively inexpensive as forest
residue, mill waste, chips, or even as
[SPEAKER_00]: sawdust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often the cost is driven more by the
transportation and handling than the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be dependent on location as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times people are using wood heat
to heat their houses, so it is again a
[SPEAKER_00]: very common form of heat source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wood versus oil, so looking at kind of the
comparison between the two here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuel oil requirement for about 20,000
square feet of greenhouse space located in
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecticut would be about 20,000 gallons
for the heating season.
[SPEAKER_00]: If wood is substituted as a fuel source,
this would require approximately 110 cords
[SPEAKER_00]: of hardwood.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that handling about 220 tons if
the furnace was fired by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's again an important consideration
when we're looking at how we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be utilizing the wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a manual loading type.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost of the wood is only $6,000
delivered in log length compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: $35,000 for the estimated oil cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind that log length is not
nice chopped up and kind of ready to go as
[SPEAKER_00]: the picture shows above me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference is enough to have
reasonable payback for the equipment and
[SPEAKER_00]: to pay for what's called a night fireman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody has to constantly feed that fire
and keep it going for the duration of the
[SPEAKER_00]: night when it is the coldest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, all these have to be taken into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we're looking at wood,
we also want to be considerate of the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Furnaces and boilers that burn cordwood or
chips and sawdust are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heat value of the fuel depends on the
moisture content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, green hole tree chips have
a heat value of about 8 million BTUs per
[SPEAKER_00]: ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dried chips have a heat value of 14
million BTUs per ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that reduction in moisture content
really increases the BTUs or the British
[SPEAKER_00]: thermal units of that wood that it can
provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the wood is burned at high
temperatures, more than 1500 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit, very little smoke or pollution
occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another important consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get that heat high enough,
you can have a very clean burning with
[SPEAKER_00]: your wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that wood could be relatively low
cost, but there are going to be that
[SPEAKER_00]: associated night fireman, manual feeding,
that low moisture content taken into
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration, as well as the having
enough supply for your area, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: how cold that season may be.
