[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to talk about LED
grow lights, which stands for light
[SPEAKER_00]: emitting diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's one in the grow tent by
Fluence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a full spectrum LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So LED stands for, again, a light emitting
diode, and this is what they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many, many little tiny diodes that come
together to produce that nice full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the greatest advancements
are being made, the LED light market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light fixtures are made up of many,
many small bulbs or these kind of diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light is efficient and directed
downwards towards the plant canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs also produce low heat and are energy
efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind low heat does not mean no
heat, but compared to some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: options, cooling becomes less of a concern
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it's still important, you may not to
be as efficient than compared to some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other lighting options that exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are the purple colored lights we see
here, but the full spectrum white lights
[SPEAKER_00]: are coming on the market and are gaining
popularity, as we can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because no special glasses are required
and they provide a presentable grow space
[SPEAKER_00]: in appearance and also benefit the plant
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spectrum produce closely matches the needs
of plants, so it's a very efficient way to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce light.
[SPEAKER_00]: These grow lamps are utilizing a
combination of blue and red to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrums to best fit plants' needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why they are gaining popularity,
because the plants can grow basically from
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling to veg to flower under the same
lighting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some growers are reporting improved
cannabinoids and terpenes with the full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're energy efficient compared to
typical fluorescence and HAD lamps and
[SPEAKER_00]: generate minimal heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: These lights have the ability to produce
infrared, ultraviolet light, including
[SPEAKER_00]: colors in between these spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also last very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Fluence SpiderX Plus LED lights can
hold peak brilliance, which is 70% or
[SPEAKER_00]: greater, for 100,000 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great selling point just
there, in the sense that you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep changing bulbs out or worry about
getting up and moving a fixture if you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the things you can put in
place and be guaranteed for a very long
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage of LED lights, and these are
the full spectrum lights, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: considered to be the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're making improvements, and even
currently some of the newer ones out are
[SPEAKER_00]: really well advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: They offer a full spectrum, which is a
great feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a very long life, low energy
consumption, and low heat production.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, with all those pros, there's
still some cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The initial cost, they tend to be more
expensive, and the total coverage area,
[SPEAKER_00]: in some cases, can be limiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Providing one as an example, the Fluence
Viper 2X, which I have in the grow tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's an example just before I set it up,
is a full spectrum lights, energy
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient, I get the added dimmer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got great coverage and high PPFD
ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, while these do last long,
they have cooling fins.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no motors here to run cooling
fans, which will burn out and cause all
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of issues in the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just basically passively cooled
here, and with the carbon filter and
[SPEAKER_00]: ventilation system I have, I'm able to
exhaust the air, keep the general
[SPEAKER_00]: environment at a proper grow temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great that there's no fans in here to
allow long operation in addition to the
[SPEAKER_00]: diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does generate some heat, but runs
relatively cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that it's dimmable allows me to
use it throughout the entire grow cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: and has been a great full spectrum light
to have in the grow tent.
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
