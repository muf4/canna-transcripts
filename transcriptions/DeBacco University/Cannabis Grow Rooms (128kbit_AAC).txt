[SPEAKER_00]: Now when looking at cannabis grow rooms,
it can be a highly varied operation,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it may be under the same term.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see here the plants,
how they're organized, the lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: the venting, some of the insulation that's
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I would make note of
this particular grow room would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of power that's used over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to be mindful and careful about
where we're putting all of our power,
[SPEAKER_00]: how we're stringing everything together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to typically have it cleaner and
neater than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe in an area that's in decreased
humidity to decrease the chance of having
[SPEAKER_00]: a short circuit or having the potential
for fire to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just because you see a grow
room, you may be only focused on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, but also look at some of the
supporting structures and be mindful that
[SPEAKER_00]: every grow room is not necessarily the
most efficient or the correct option to go
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just grow rooms in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are permanent rooms that are not
like a portable grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though grow tents are great places to
start to kind of experiment and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: can kind of upscale to a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: These rooms typically have pretty easy
access to power because they're typically
[SPEAKER_00]: designed for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think of it in one way,
it's almost like a permanent grow tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: very large and permanent grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: By starting with a grow tent, it can help
minimize some of the mistakes you'll make
[SPEAKER_00]: in this room because this is a much larger
operation with a lot more upfront cost and
[SPEAKER_00]: also reoccurring costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's small scale grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say kind of define what small is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people's small is like a small
little grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people, this might be a small
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, your definition of small should be
looking at either square foot or number of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these grow rooms, it can be soilless
media containers or even hydroponic setups
[SPEAKER_00]: can work efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to only move plants in that had
time to develop sufficient roots from the
[SPEAKER_00]: clone and propagation room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a veg room in this image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trellising may be needed as a plant
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure to use clean material that is
either new for each planting or that has
[SPEAKER_00]: been cleaned before reuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see a couple of stakes in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to just keep the stakes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to clean them before another
round of plants may come into this
[SPEAKER_00]: vicinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now large grow rooms, there's no set
definition of what a large grow room is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically it's considered usually about 25
or greater plants and it's often not
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended for a beginner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply because there's just a lot of
expense and knowledge that is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dense foliage in a larger room can
reduce air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here, we see these can filters
and can fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can really help improve air
circulation when you're growing a very
[SPEAKER_00]: large scale, efficient way to kind of move
some air to prevent some of the issues
[SPEAKER_00]: that can occur when you increase plant
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for larger grow rooms, typically
there's more forms of automation that come
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's automatic watering,
fertilizer injecting, dehumidifying,
[SPEAKER_00]: air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, just because you're adding in all
of these wonderful systems, these
[SPEAKER_00]: automated systems, this does not mean that
the work decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one person is running a large grow
room, there's simply not enough time to
[SPEAKER_00]: perform some of the tedious tasks for all
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When something might be very possible and
a one to four to five plant operation may
[SPEAKER_00]: not work in a very large grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this automation takes care of some of
those daily maintenance tasks,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you still need to be kind of hands-on
on monitoring, trellising, pruning,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the daily tasks there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That simply gets more difficult as the
plant number increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
