[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to investigate
ventilation benefits for plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's very important to keep air
circulation and air movement for your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, and here we're going to
investigate why that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with keeping air moving,
it's important to have continual air
[SPEAKER_00]: movement around the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In nature, very still conditions are rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always a breeze of some kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to be on a sailboat to
realize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the prevalence of wind
turbines, or if you look at any flag,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically flapping, and even the slightest
of breeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to create or maintain these
natural conditions, because this is of
[SPEAKER_00]: much benefit to our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mixing our air.
[SPEAKER_00]: High air rises, and not mixing air can
lead to thermal stratification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is high air is going to
rise, and that we want it to stay to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the top, and cold air will sink
and try to stay 10 towards the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only does air need to be exchanged
between the inside and the outside,
[SPEAKER_00]: but circulation is important to limit this
stratification that could occur,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also to reduce the chance of disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than have 50 degrees Celsius up
here and 40 down here, 45 kind of mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be too hot for our
plants, but this just gives you that idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of having everything homogenized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon dioxide depletion, because plants
consume carbon dioxide, and if air is left
[SPEAKER_00]: stagnant, it can become depleted in this
carbon dioxide, which can result in
[SPEAKER_00]: negatively impacting the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because carbon dioxide, remember,
the carbon is used for the sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: production, which is used now to help the
plant grow, but also to maintain itself
[SPEAKER_00]: and allow the roots to do the respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure we're not
depleting our CO2, which if air is
[SPEAKER_00]: stagnant, that can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: By mixing that air, we're ensuring that
there's adequate CO2 hopefully being mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: around the plant, instead of just it being
depleted around the leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air circulation and exchange is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, you have air exit out the top
points of a structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of a grow tent here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an exhaust fan here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be exhausting air out the top
of the structure, and intake would be
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in at the lower points.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to remove the hot air and
bring in cooler air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite air movement, ideally,
the difference in temperature should be
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal to reduce plant stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be exhausting really hot
air and bringing in really cold air,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that can make it very difficult to
maintain consistent conditions for your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to have about 75 to 80 degrees
Fahrenheit for your plants during the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can cool it down to 65 to 70 or so
Fahrenheit at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that fresh air intake, one of the
things you want to do is make sure the air
[SPEAKER_00]: is evenly dispersed in the room,
and the temperature does not cause shock
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to be extremely hot or
extremely cold, and you do want it to be
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of evenly dispersed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can change where you place intake
or exhaust valves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping in mind, you don't want to go
through that high temperature shock,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it would be not only a stress
potentially to your heating and cooling
[SPEAKER_00]: system, but also the plants you're trying
to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air ducting, the goal is to avoid harsh
angles when you do have ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to have a lot of right
angles or 180 degree loops or bends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have efficient airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not always possible to run a
complete straight line, but you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: here I've maintained kind of as straight
of a line as I possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have too many bends in it,
that's going to increase air resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: and reduce your efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this carbon filter is towards the front
of the tent here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exhausting out the middle,
so there's just a gentle bend here as it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes out the ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Target room conditions, we're looking at
75 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit during the
[SPEAKER_00]: day, nighttime 65 to 70, and that 50 to
60% humidity or so is what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: generally targeting for your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now moving air around plants, this is
important because it helps keep plants
[SPEAKER_00]: strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of have them sway in the breeze a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can help keep them rigid and stronger
instead of getting really leggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also help reduce disease from
preventing moisture from building up in
[SPEAKER_00]: certain areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minimize thermal stratification,
which is great because you will have an
[SPEAKER_00]: even temperature at the top and bottom of
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can allow CO2 to be mixed to help
prevent starving plants of the vital
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now mixing of this air can be large fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a smaller operation,
this little six inch fan, if you're in a
[SPEAKER_00]: small grow tent, this may be enough to
keep your plants nice and happy.
