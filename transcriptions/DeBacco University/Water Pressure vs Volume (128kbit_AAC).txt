[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, regarding water pressure and volume,
I want to go over just a couple terms that
[SPEAKER_00]: are used for each so you can understand
them when they're applied to different
[SPEAKER_00]: situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put this picture here of a
firefighter fighting the fire with water
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure versus volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pressure is referring to that force that's
occurring on the hose here, going out to
[SPEAKER_00]: extinguish the fire, and the volume is
just simply the amount of water being
[SPEAKER_00]: applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's first look at water pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's measured in pounds per square inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's PSI, and you'll typically see it's
PSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it stands for pounds per square
inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typical home water pressure is about 40 to
50 PSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excessive water pressure can lead to
leaks, so we don't want to have just more
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure isn't always better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pressure is coming from those
molecules bouncing against the container
[SPEAKER_00]: of the sides here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pressure regulators can help ensure that
pipe pressure doesn't exceed a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be important for irrigation
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, regulators are mechanical,
usually in nature, and they should be
[SPEAKER_00]: changed out so they can wear out over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're having an increase in pressure
and you have a regulator still in place,
[SPEAKER_00]: that regulator is old, you might want to
change that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also buy some water pressure
gauges here so you can have an idea if
[SPEAKER_00]: that regulator is actually wearing out
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one I mentioned here is water
volume, and that's a measure of the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of water that can be delivered over a set
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be thought of as the flow rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically it's stated as gallons per
minute, GPM, or gallons per hour,
[SPEAKER_00]: GPH.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be impacted by the diameter of
the pipe used.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can affect the amount of gallons you
can deliver in one minute or one hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: The minimum flow rate would be about five
gallons per minute for many irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to work in some way, calculate
this, so you know what your volume is,
[SPEAKER_00]: your flow rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You simply get a five gallon pail,
make sure it's marked, get the hose ready,
[SPEAKER_00]: get a timer, and start the timer,
start filling the bucket up, and see how
[SPEAKER_00]: far you can get it in an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: A set amount of time, and you can factor
that out for a minute, you can do it for
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 seconds, to just figure out what your
flow rate is, because that's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: used in a lot of irrigation calculations
as far as what you can actually run and
[SPEAKER_00]: what the flow rate is of your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that was helpful,
describing the volume versus pressure of
[SPEAKER_00]: water, because it is applied to a lot of
situations with plants and irrigation in general.
