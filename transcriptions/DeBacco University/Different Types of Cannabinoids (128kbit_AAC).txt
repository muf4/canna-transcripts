[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to provide you with a brief
[SPEAKER_00]: overview of some different types of
cannabinoids found in cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as at the end, give you some
direction as far as some other detailed
[SPEAKER_00]: videos that go into some specific
cannabinoids to provide you with more
[SPEAKER_00]: information on those particular ones,
if you have interest in those.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so here we see a nice looking
cannabis bud developing, and we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to go through the different types of
cannabinoids that this bud might be
[SPEAKER_00]: producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, cannabinoids and chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So research has found that the cannabis
plant produces between 80 and 100
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and about 300
non-cannabinoid-related chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two main cannabinoids are delta-9-THC
as well as cannabidiol or CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here we can see that there's a lot of
other things being produced in that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of other pathways going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to touch on some of them here
and provide you with more information on
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the specifics for cannabinoids in
other videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, THC versus CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably the two most,
quote, famous or most well-known
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main difference between these is
that THC has strong psychoactive effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning it makes a person, quote,
high, whereas CBD is thought to have
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-psychoactive effects that controls or
moderates the, quote, high caused by THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is also thought to reduce some other
negative effects that people can
[SPEAKER_00]: experience from THC, such as anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see kind of potential benefits
and side effects of both listed here,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of in a comparative sense there to
provide you with a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind that when we're looking
at cannabinoids, it is more than just THC
[SPEAKER_00]: and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's THCV, there's CBN, there's CBC,
and there's a whole bunch of other ones as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep in mind that there are more
cannabinoids and we're going to explore
[SPEAKER_00]: those in more details on other videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're wondering what type of
cannabinoids we're going to get into,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, through Devaco University,
you search any of these particular titles
[SPEAKER_00]: or cannabinoids, you should be able to
find more information, a good comparison,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to give you an idea of some of the
diversity that does occur within
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids to allow you to find a little
bit more detailed information if you're so
[SPEAKER_00]: seeking that.
