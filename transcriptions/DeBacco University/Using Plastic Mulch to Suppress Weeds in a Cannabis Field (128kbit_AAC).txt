[SPEAKER_00]: So in this DeBacco University video,
we're going to be looking at using plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch to suppress weeds in a cannabis
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that in the image right here,
where plastic mulch is being utilized to
[SPEAKER_00]: help cut down on the weeds in between
plants planted in the same row.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll look at this in more detail here on
this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into using plastic
mulch to suppress weeds in a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, the benefits of plastic
mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would we want to select this in the
first place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a long-used option worldwide
since the 1960s, and it's used mainly with
[SPEAKER_00]: annual plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to provide weed control,
improve plant growth, modified soil
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, retain soil moisture,
increase yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, this applies more than just to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can apply to other plants as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes just having onions grown in
plastic mulch can really help increase
[SPEAKER_00]: their growth compared to those that might
be right next to them in a row that is
[SPEAKER_00]: left with bare soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plastic mulch and related to cannabis
production specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at plastic mulch,
it's a good option if you're starting with
[SPEAKER_00]: clones due to their poor ability for
cannabis to initially compete with weed
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the use of clones does not allow for
the use of post-emergent herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another advantage or reason why
you may want to consider plastic mulch for
[SPEAKER_00]: your in-row weed control.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, plastic mulch can increase
the soil temperature, allowing for early
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to establish quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warms that soil up, gets that root zone
temperature a little bit warmer,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little faster, which can be particularly
important in the early part of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the challenges with plastic mulch
because no system is 100% perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plastic mulch, the removal and disposal
can be labor intensive and also expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general cost of the material is also
potentially cost prohibitive to some
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The estimated costs up to $534 per hectare
in horticultural systems with a 2.4 meter
[SPEAKER_00]: spacing between bed centers was observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have to consider the disposal of
that at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plastic mulch has waste management
challenges associated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like where do you put all the plastic
mulch after you're done with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's hard to remove but then you
remove it and the question is now what?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about recycling our plastic
mulches?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, about 90% of used plastic mulch that
is used in the United States mostly ends
[SPEAKER_00]: up in a landfill, stockpiled or sadly
burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often not recycled due to the limited
sites and contamination during usage and
[SPEAKER_00]: simply the high cost of transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see some sources listed here as
well as you're always welcome to look in
[SPEAKER_00]: the description for a link to sources
listed by each slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now before you install plastic mulches,
growers should be committed to a drip
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation method with a fertilizer
injector, something that's going to make
[SPEAKER_00]: your overall system much more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the soil will essentially be sealed
and I put sealed in quotes here,
[SPEAKER_00]: under plastic irrigation it will very
likely be needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see the drip tape, here we see
the drip setup because you're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: sealing that environment out and that's a
great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to be very efficient and
the water is in there but installing that
[SPEAKER_00]: drip system will ensure you can irrigate
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, side dressing with nutrients
is also impeded with plastic mulch so
[SPEAKER_00]: having a fertigation system is also
advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the soil should still be amended
if needed based on a soil test before the
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch is applied to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't assume it's going to cover with
mulch at a fertilizer and it'll be all
[SPEAKER_00]: set.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil does need amending, you are
recommended to do that before laying your
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the options when we're looking at
plastic mulch, we want to consider the
[SPEAKER_00]: width.
[SPEAKER_00]: How wide will your rows be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Common widths of 36 and 60 inches but
others options may exist and may be a
[SPEAKER_00]: better fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Texture, want slick or embossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically the embossed plastic has a
visible pattern on the surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: is more resistant to damage due to
punctures wind fatigue, cracking,
[SPEAKER_00]: then compared to non embossed mulches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also linear low density has a slick
surface appearance but may have a linear
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern with the goal to reduce the chance
of tears while in use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another option you want to be concerned of
is the thickness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thickness varies from 0.6 mil to 2 mil or
greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to use an adequate strength
material and typically a 1 mil to 1.25 mil
[SPEAKER_00]: embossed plastic is adequate for most
applications and is recommended despite
[SPEAKER_00]: potential increased in cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want to go too cheap because you'll
be just dealing with a pain and a mess to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want to go too thick because if
you're only using it for one year you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't necessarily need to incur that much
of a cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we also have color choices when it
comes to plastic mulches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them get really crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common color option is the
traditional black color but there are
[SPEAKER_00]: other coloration options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers have the option for white and
black.
[SPEAKER_00]: White and black which may be used with
either side facing upwards depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: the specific need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind how you utilize these
mulches can also impact potential plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clear mulch is great for warming the soil
but has limited weed suppression abilities
[SPEAKER_00]: so keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aluminum or silver but not gray reflective
mulch reflects solar radiation and
[SPEAKER_00]: research has shown it can repel aphids
which can spread viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also have a cooling effect on the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind it's aluminum that's like
a reflective mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aluminum or silver is not the same as a
gray coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers get the gray and they think
they're getting this nice aluminum type
[SPEAKER_00]: color because it has a sort of kind of
gray appearance but you want aluminum or
[SPEAKER_00]: silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want that really highly reflective
material and be sure when you're applying
[SPEAKER_00]: this it's a cloudy day and still you are
highly recommended to wear sunglasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very very bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other cold mulches as we see here may
affect plant growth in a positive ways but
[SPEAKER_00]: more research needs to be done in regards
to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can see there's a whole wide range of
colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditional black or silver is typically
what's recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly we're looking at the equipment to
go through if we're looking at committing
[SPEAKER_00]: to plastic mulches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be mindful of your field prep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure your field is all
set to go before you're considering
[SPEAKER_00]: mulches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have a mulch layer with drip
irrigation wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ideally at the end of the season
a mulch lifter can make the laborious task
[SPEAKER_00]: of removing that much much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again you can see there's a lot of
equipment especially on the large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of commitment to this mulch but
there is a lot of equipment simply because
[SPEAKER_00]: it is pretty widely used for the reasons
mentioned here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also keep in mind some of those
drawbacks to see if is this the best fit
[SPEAKER_00]: for your environment.
