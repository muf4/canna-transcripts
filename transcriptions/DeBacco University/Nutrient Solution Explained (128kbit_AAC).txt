[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to go over explaining
what a nutrient solution is and things to
[SPEAKER_00]: look for when you're creating one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I put the picture here because this is
not a nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just regular bagged fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this might be able to be mixed and
made into a nutrient solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: but keep in mind this in its kind of raw
solid form is not considered a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to in some way have a solution be
aqueous or dissolved in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since we're looking at water,
we need to start with targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what water are we going to use?
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically what you want to start with
is some basic testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH and EC are two easy tests you can
complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your targets are starting with water in
that six to six and a half pH range and EC
[SPEAKER_00]: under 150 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why you want a low EC and this
is why RO or reverse osmosis water is so
[SPEAKER_00]: revered for many growers in the sense that
the lower the EC is when you're adding
[SPEAKER_00]: that allows you to add more fertilizer and
not have kind of waste or background parts
[SPEAKER_00]: per million kind of clogging.
[SPEAKER_00]: up the availability of sites in that water
that you're using to irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pH is important as you remember that pH
is determines the availability of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the pH drifts this will negatively
impact your plants and we see that
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly acidic range typically being
where we want to want to keep our pH
[SPEAKER_00]: simply because most of the nutrients are
at the greatest availability in this pH
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know as for example calcium we get
much more acidic and we kind of lose that
[SPEAKER_00]: and we start getting into the basic range
we see can kind of iron will really drop
[SPEAKER_00]: out and so will manganese.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we want to shoot for that
slightly acidic pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to monitor these so measure the
salts or nutrients in the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to start with a low ppm because
that provides you with more control over
[SPEAKER_00]: what salts and where nutrients or salts
that are present in that solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a continual running meter is
important to help ensure you maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: levels at the acceptable range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically you're looking for around 300 to
700 parts per million and EC of about half
[SPEAKER_00]: to 1.5 to 1.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the blue lab guardian monitor here
not only measuring our parts per million
[SPEAKER_00]: but our temperature and also our pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives a quite nice quick look to see
where you are and this is slightly on the
[SPEAKER_00]: high side I just kind of added here so I
was kind of waiting for it to balance out
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe just over at it just a little bit
but temperature looks real good and pH is
[SPEAKER_00]: right in that general slightly acidic
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that nutrient solution remember that pH
may be acidic or basic depending on what
[SPEAKER_00]: the main nutrient is and that can be
depending also on what you're feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So monitoring the pH is important with the
ideal target for cannabis being again
[SPEAKER_00]: around that six and a half range is good
to shoot for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on what nutrient you might be
feeding how you're making that nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: solution it can affect whether it might be
favoring more the acidic range or more the
[SPEAKER_00]: basic range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in hydroponics settings there are
minimal buffering factors which can lead
[SPEAKER_00]: to drastic swings in pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can stress plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I stress the idea of having
continual monitoring because without a
[SPEAKER_00]: buffer factor that pH can make large
swings when you're adding or mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients or as roots develop there can be
a lack of buffer in that water depending
[SPEAKER_00]: on the solution you're using so just keep
extra attention on that if you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing in media whether it be soilless
media or soil here these situations
[SPEAKER_00]: there's more buffer factors and this can
help stabilize the pH and reduce large
[SPEAKER_00]: swings from occurring even in heavy
feeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the benefits of growing in
media it does allow some of that buffer
[SPEAKER_00]: factor to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing for example in like a
rock wall well there's a media that really
[SPEAKER_00]: offers no buffering factor so keep that in
mind as far as what media you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's soilless or soil here there's a
greater buffer factor but you can still
[SPEAKER_00]: have swings in pH so again watch the
nutrient solution that you're adding to
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly flushing plants so letting some
solution drain out of the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: container is advised to help reduce
excessive salt accumulation in the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called flushing so this is where
you're adding a lot of water and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: holes hopefully in the bottom of your
containers you have a catch base in here
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's not making a mess anywhere and you
can kind of regulate and monitor how much
[SPEAKER_00]: water is actually being flushed through
the media that you're using for your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this helps explain a little bit of
nutrient solutions and how they're
[SPEAKER_00]: utilized and what to look for to maximize
the efficiency of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
