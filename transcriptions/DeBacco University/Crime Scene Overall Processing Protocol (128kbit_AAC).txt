[SPEAKER_00]: In this video at DeBacker University,
we're going to be looking at crime scene
[SPEAKER_00]: overall processing protocol, kind of that
overview on how you go about processing a
[SPEAKER_00]: crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Investigation involves and always involves
that placards exchange principle,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that something is always leaving
that trace and it's our goal here as
[SPEAKER_00]: investigators to try to find those trace
evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, we don't want to overthink
things sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to use simple logic to help direct
our investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to use the scientific method as
well as far as going through the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem-solving process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as always, we want to stay organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organized so that we can refer back to
notes, refer back to diagrams,
[SPEAKER_00]: photos, pictures, evidence collected so
that we can find answers to questions that
[SPEAKER_00]: may be asked shortly after or long term
after the initial investigation had taken
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at the diagram here,
just kind of an example of
[SPEAKER_00]: problem-solving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I give you the weights of these
objects in three different areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: can we calculate the weight in kilograms
of the two cucumbers alone?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at forensic investigation
techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to look at recognition,
which is that surveying the scene,
[SPEAKER_00]: document observations, collecting
evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have identification, which is the
comparison to what is out of the norm.
[SPEAKER_00]: What doesn't look right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then of our individualization,
which is the evaluate and interpret
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last way of the
reconstruction, which is involving the
[SPEAKER_00]: report and presenting of findings to kind
of reconstruct what we think may have
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred based on all of the previous
collection of evidence and organization of
[SPEAKER_00]: that evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do we go about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, step one is interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to interview the first officer at
the scene or the victim to determine what
[SPEAKER_00]: allegedly might have happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask what the crime took place and how the
crime was committed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note, however, this information may not be
factual, but it's intended to provide an
[SPEAKER_00]: investigator a starting place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't mean just because you
interviewed someone who was there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you take their word as 100% correct,
but it does allow you to provide you a
[SPEAKER_00]: starting place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can lead, that can help you lead
and help the examination phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We identify possible evidence,
select a point of entry and a point of
[SPEAKER_00]: exit, develop a general layout of the
crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these can be very important in an
examination process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that first step of that
interview can help you at least initially
[SPEAKER_00]: plan and organize how you're going to go
about the examination step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we look at documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to create photographic records
and a rough sketch of the crime scene,
[SPEAKER_00]: identify the exact position of deceased
victim and other evidence within the crime
[SPEAKER_00]: scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be a very time consuming and
tedious process, but it is vitally
[SPEAKER_00]: important not to keep things organized,
but to also ensure that anything you
[SPEAKER_00]: collect is also upholds in court as
evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly here, we're looking at the
processing step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this applies to both physical and
testimonial evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technicians are responsible for
identifying, evaluating, collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: physical evidence from the crime scene as
this will be further analyzed in the crime
[SPEAKER_00]: scene laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this processing point, so we're
collecting some more of that specific
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we may not be doing this for every
piece of data collected, but based on kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of what we think may have happened or what
kind of events we're looking at,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can help guide the process where that
time is going to be spent as we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at kind of recreating what may have
occurred at a particular crime scene we're
[SPEAKER_00]: investigating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for your attention.
