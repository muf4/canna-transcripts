[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to investigate the
plant hormone salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're wondering if this name
sounds a little familiar, it is very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to the compound found in aspirin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the rumors or folklores come
up with if you add an aspirin to your
[SPEAKER_00]: watering can when you go and water your
plant, how that could be beneficial for
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that stems from this particular plant
hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So salicylic acid impacts plant growth and
development, the photosynthetic pathway,
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration, ion uptake, and transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one little hormone can involve a
lot of plant processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be involved in signaling and
meeting plant defenses against pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all impacts that this one
single hormone can have on plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it plays roles in resistance to
pathogens as well, and this is where that
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's involved in the systemic acquired
resistance in which pathogen attack on one
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the plant induces resistance in
other parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is involving if there's one
area that's seeing a point of infection,
[SPEAKER_00]: this hormone can be activated,
sent to other parts of the plant to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of upregulate the defenses to help make
the other plant more resistant to a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of that pathogen having to infect
different areas of the plant, having it in
[SPEAKER_00]: one area, upregulating this particular
hormone, that signal can be passed through
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant to make it better to defend
itself against that pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if it's in one part, odds are it's
going to want to spread to others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now not only can the signal impact the
original plant that becomes infected,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that includes different parts of that
plant, the signal can also move to nearby
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens when a plant converts the
salicylic acid to volatile compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it can be released as like a mist here
in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great advantage to plants,
because if there's one point of infection,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is one way one individual plant can
get the signal out to its neighbors that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a pathogen under attack,
hopefully upregulating their defense
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms to reduce the impact that
pathogen can have not only on the original
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that it infected, but the
surrounding plants in that area.
Thank you.
Thank you.
