[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another video here on DeBaco
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to be looking at
characteristics of common fibers,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at both natural and synthetic
fibers in this presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, natural fibers, while there are many,
the ones we're going to be focusing on
[SPEAKER_00]: here in this presentation are going to be
wool, cotton, hemp, jute, and silk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that there are many other
fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, these are typically made into
clothing and likely to be found and
[SPEAKER_00]: analyzed for comparison purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the wool fibers themselves are
typically a natural hair grown on sheep
[SPEAKER_00]: and are composed of protein substances
such as keratin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wool fibers have crimps and curls which
create pockets and give the wool a spongy
[SPEAKER_00]: feel and create insulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates kind of that air spaces that
allow it to have great insulating
[SPEAKER_00]: properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outer surface of the fiber consists of
a series of serrated scales which overlap
[SPEAKER_00]: each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a microscopic view, but they kind
of look like scales of a fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes it possible for these fibers to
cling together and produce felt.
[SPEAKER_00]: This insulating factor is great here for
the sheep and llamas and alpacas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have that very similar insulating
property with their fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going on to plant material, looking here
at cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most important textile fiber in
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cotton is a natural vegetable fiber and
produced on the cotton plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of looks like cotton balls on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is in its natural form.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be harvested here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cotton magnified to about 100 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some of the fibers are rather
flat and looks like a ribbon when it
[SPEAKER_00]: twists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see that evident right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp or flax fibers, they are cellulose
fibers with properties that are similar
[SPEAKER_00]: and are scarily differentiated at the
fiber form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this differentiation between these two
as far as identifying specifically which
[SPEAKER_00]: one that we have is complicated by the
treatment process that sometimes it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to identify whether you're
looking at a flax or a hemp fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, jute fibers themselves are one of the
most important and affordable natural
[SPEAKER_00]: fibers and is harder than other textile
fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, they're made into, for example,
burlap bags in jute twine because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: environmentally friendly and normally used
for these kind of materials or tufts of
[SPEAKER_00]: carpet where there's a lot of structure
that's needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the fact that they're biodegradable
is great that they can be used outside a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of times to hang up tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use it jute twine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, while it is biodegradable,
it doesn't break down necessarily very
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly and can be left in the field for a
little while before it naturally over time
[SPEAKER_00]: will break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also silk fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So silk fibers also made of proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are secreted by a caterpillar,
specifically a silkworm, and they feed on
[SPEAKER_00]: selective plants and they actually spin
cocoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They form this silk as a protective shell
to perpetuate their own life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man interferes with the life cycle of the
cocoon stage to obtain the silk,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a continuous filament for
commercial importance and is thought of to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce very high-end fibers in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking now at synthetic fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rayon, acrylic, polyester, nylon,
and spun glass are the ones we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be looking at here that fall under the
synthetic fiber category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, rayon's the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rayon will absorb moisture more so than
cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also breathable, comfortable to
touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's able to wear and easily dyed into
vivid colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what makes it a popular choice for
clothing, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also doesn't build up static
electricity, nor will it develop that
[SPEAKER_00]: pilling unless the fiber is made from
short, low-twist yarns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rayon shares properties similar to those
of cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rayon fiber itself is comfortable,
soft to the skin, has moderate dry
[SPEAKER_00]: strength and abrasion resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, all properties that make it very
favorable to meet into different textiles,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly clothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acrylic can be thought of as artificial
wool imitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has wool's warmth and softness,
but does not absorb water, but wicks
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture to the surface where it
evaporates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's important to know if you're
looking at, you know, a type of clothing
[SPEAKER_00]: or something that may have involved water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows an example of acrylic fiber
showing the melt termination in the lower
[SPEAKER_00]: right, see right here, and the mechanical
damage termination in the upper left up
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're looking at the microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ways to help identify this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polyester.
[SPEAKER_00]: So polyester is the most commonly used
synthetic fiber, often blend with other
[SPEAKER_00]: fibers like cotton to get the best kind of
of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because while polyester fibers have good
elasticity and wrinkle resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: shape retention, excellent wash and wear
performance and durability, it hurts
[SPEAKER_00]: widely used.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, polyester fibers are as poor in
moisture absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its clothing makes the wearer feel hot and
sticky, which people don't want to feel,
[SPEAKER_00]: but does have a lot of other advantage
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, this is why it can be
mixed with other fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that polyester alone kind of produces
that static electricity easily when a
[SPEAKER_00]: result of clothing absorbing dust cling to
the body and has poor comfort.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why you typically have a blend of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it alone, sample polyester fibers,
sample here, polyester thread,
[SPEAKER_00]: inference colors, high order white,
which can be seen here with multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: interference orders, evident where the
fiber cross at right angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that evident here and here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're looking at this bar would
represent 50 microns for looking at size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nylon does not absorb water, but also
means that the movement combined to create
[SPEAKER_00]: static electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is again, something else where may
not be a pure garment made only of nylon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the look and feel of silk,
as we can kind of see the shininess to the
[SPEAKER_00]: twine kind of here, it's made of nylon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used in sheer, it's used in sails,
parachutes, gowns, veils, swimsuits,
[SPEAKER_00]: car tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has a lot of uses, different types
of nylon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now also can be replaced wool as the fiber
used in carpets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a sample of nylon fiber from a
furnace air filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can kind of see how we're getting
those, what it looks like when it crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: over and also the distance here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also get it looking at it woven
here on the microscopic scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we have spun glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the strongest textile
fibers having the greater specific tensile
[SPEAKER_00]: strength than steel wire and the same
diameter at a lower weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just that alone speaks to its rigidity
and its strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the glass fabrics have excellent heat
resistance with a softening point of about
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,555 degrees Fahrenheit or 846 degrees
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a melting point, it's very high of
over 2000 degrees Fahrenheit and over
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,100 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glass fabrics are non-combustible,
high resistance, resistant to attack by
[SPEAKER_00]: most chemicals and unaffected by sunlight
fungus or bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is great if they're going to be
used in areas that maybe have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight exposure, need resistance to
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do have some great properties and
it's very strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it may not always be the case
that we may need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a different kind of texture or
feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why some of your other fibers
are more commonly found in clothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for specialized tasks, spun glass
definitely has a purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoyed this video.
