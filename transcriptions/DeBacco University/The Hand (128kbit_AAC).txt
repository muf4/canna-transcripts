[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to investigate the
hand and some of the bones that make up
[SPEAKER_00]: the hand and what their proper terminology
is, and also where they're located.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with, in general, we have the
carpals, the metacarpals, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: phalanges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each hand consists of 27 bones that are
divided as wrist bones, which are the
[SPEAKER_00]: carpals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I'm going to be thinking down
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our palm bones are actually the
metacarpals, and our finger bones are the
[SPEAKER_00]: phalanges.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at them in just a
little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see that they're color-coded
here, and there's more than one type of
[SPEAKER_00]: phalanges called distal and intermediate
phalanges, and also proximal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those terms of being able to understand
distal, proximal, still come into play,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you see that theme reoccurring
throughout the many units of the skeletal
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with the carpals here,
the eight irregularly shaped carpals are
[SPEAKER_00]: the most proximal bones of the hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, if we're looking at the hand
here, distal would be furthest away,
[SPEAKER_00]: proximal would be closest to the midline,
so we're most proximal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're right here in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be the carpals.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's eight irregularly shaped bones in
this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, we have our radius and our
ulna down here, and just above them,
[SPEAKER_00]: they articulate with the carpals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Above the carpals, we actually have the
metacarpals of the hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It consists of the five metacarpals that
articulate proximally with the carpals and
[SPEAKER_00]: distally with the proximal phalanges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're numbered, moving laterally to
medial to start with the thumb,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is metacarpal one, I'm sorry,
which is metacarpal one, and then end with
[SPEAKER_00]: metacarpal five at the little finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that they're numbered,
moving laterally, starting with the thumb
[SPEAKER_00]: region, and these are also considered
areas of our palm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last here, we have the phalanges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the digit's named in similar fashion
to the metacarpals moving laterally to the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle and starting with the thumb again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thumb again is their starting
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if we look at this image,
we see our distal phalanges, our immediate
[SPEAKER_00]: and our proximal phalanges, and we look at
particularly the thumb region,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's one color here in particular
missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their intermediate phalanges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the exception is the thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: This contains only a proximal,
indicating green here, and a distal
[SPEAKER_00]: phalange.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no intermediate phalange as part
of your thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: This lacks this intermediate phalange.
[SPEAKER_00]: The length of the phalanges decreases
distally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we're getting further away,
our phalanges are getting smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: The size or length of those bones is
getting progressively smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, again, our metacarpals,
our palms located here, and our carpals
[SPEAKER_00]: are down here, articulating with the ulma
in the radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for your attention.
Thank you.
