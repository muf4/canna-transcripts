[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBacco University video,
the rack or screen drying system for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis will be covered, so you can have
an understanding in depth on this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular drying method.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, as the image shows here,
let's get into a rack or screen drying
[SPEAKER_00]: system for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the rack system we see here,
the cannabis is usually sitting on
[SPEAKER_00]: screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why these are interchangeable
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, in general, the drying
process is critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: After all the work of growing and
harvesting, the goal is to maximize the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of the end product that's
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you cannot create a high quality
end product in the drying process,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can certainly lose what started out as
a high quality product if not performed
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to do everything right up to
this point, but don't lose the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the time, learn the drying process
and the curing process and make sure those
[SPEAKER_00]: are done correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take your quality cannabis buds
and turn them into high quality dried
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the drying racks, as I mentioned,
racks are often used in more commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: settings where there is a high volume of
plant material to dry and space wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: be utilized efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be very efficient with the
space that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drying racks also reduce the risk of
contamination to develop by ensuring
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient air circulation amongst the
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have another rack that can be
placed on top of this, very easily
[SPEAKER_00]: stackable, while still able to maintain
good levels of air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rack system also offers the ability to
aid with organization in the sense that
[SPEAKER_00]: same quality buds can be placed on the
same rack, buds in the same plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: buds in the same grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just helps overall with the
organization process there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the construction of the racks
themselves is the goal is to have an
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient and repeatable system that is
standardized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that located right here,
very consistent rack to rack, screen to
[SPEAKER_00]: screen, area to area.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there is no true correct size,
there can be large or small and it can
[SPEAKER_00]: still be efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's depending on the dimensions of your
room, the amount of plant material you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be drying at the same time and a few other
factors as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the goal is not overly packed
racks since airflow is an important
[SPEAKER_00]: component for the system to operate
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure we're having
everything operate efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, while light levels should be
kept to a minimum, the rack system offers
[SPEAKER_00]: natural shading of the buds as we see
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do want to keep these lights
minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to keep them on for a short
duration as well as the intensity of those
[SPEAKER_00]: lights we want to be very minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to risk degrading any of the
buds that we may be having in the precious
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminates or terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when it comes to developing your rack
or screen system, you don't want to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Setting up a rack system may come with
upfront cost, which after the growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: production of the actual crop,
there may not be a lot of money at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point in production, but don't skimp on
this particular system.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, many of the cost will not be
reoccurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And properly drying the final product is
critical to getting the best price
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do not go for an inferior system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go for overpacking a system,
subcar materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some can be very cost effective as we see
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some can be more expensive, but easier to
sterilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be mindful of the system you're
choosing and make sure that you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: one that's not going to put your final
crop here at any sort of undue risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, theoretically, there is no size limit
with these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: While a drying rack system, there's really
no size limit in any dimension.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, make sure the entire area the
racks take up is climate controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put a little note here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be a challenge with very tall
systems to make sure the lowest and the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest racks are under the same
conditions with minimal variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have these be really wet
and these be really dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure you're getting even
air circulation from the very top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: drying area to also the very bottom of the
drying area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, while no theoretical size
limit, the goal here is to keep these
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions consistent as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you do want to trim the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before setting the flowers to dry,
some care should be taken to perform at
[SPEAKER_00]: least an initial rough trim to reduce the
space each takes up and help aid in air
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation around each bud and offer even
drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is no matter what system you're
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using the tray system,
the circular system, the stackable system,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is just general good recommendations
there so that you have an efficient and
[SPEAKER_00]: effective drying rack or screen system for
your facility.
