[SPEAKER_00]: This is a video you've all been waiting
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Tobacco University, I'm going to
walk you through the real difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between an indica and sativa plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show you with examples,
and I hope you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people ask about the difference
between a sativa and an indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of that talk occurs at a bud
tender shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's really not what the
conversation needs to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conversation needs to occur here at a
growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: In front of me here would be what's called
a sativa dominant type plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what makes it sativa dominant?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no buds down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we tell?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know necessarily the chemical
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, the sativa indica is based on the
morphology of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one here is expressing strong
sativa dominant characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are those characteristics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's the tallness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very wispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a plant that's going to get very
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an indication of your true sativa
morphologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really describing how the plant
looks and how the plant behaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chemical profile that a lot of people
associate with a sativa or an indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go take a look at an indica
dominant variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in front of me, we're looking at
an indica dominant variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does that make it different than
the sativa we just saw?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, here's that sativa leaf getting a
little wilty, but we can see that very
[SPEAKER_00]: thin kind of leaf morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the indica will be very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is an indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say much fatter leaf, a much wider
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: A much shorter plant, you'll notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tends to be a little squatty or can still
get tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still photoperiod dependent, but the
indica sativa debate that we hear
[SPEAKER_00]: different effects that the plants produce
really isn't the true case.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really does impact the morphology of
how that plant looks, which is far a cry
[SPEAKER_00]: from what we see discussed in bud shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about chemical profiles and
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativa indica really has to do with only
the morphological differences that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly see with these two different
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here on the left, we can clearly see
the indica dominant variety by its wider
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here on the right hand side,
we can clearly see a sativa with its much
[SPEAKER_00]: thinner leaf morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, nothing to do with what you hear
in grow shops, nothing to hear what you
[SPEAKER_00]: hear in bud tenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all has to do with the morphology or
the physical structure of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
