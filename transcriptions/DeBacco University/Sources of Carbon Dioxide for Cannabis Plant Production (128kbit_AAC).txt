[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to add carbon dioxide to your
grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a variety of sources of that
carbon dioxide that you can add.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here on Tobacco University,
I'll provide you with some quick
[SPEAKER_00]: advantages and disadvantages of each,
and then go into more detail on each of
[SPEAKER_00]: the sources described here in other videos
that can be found on this channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into sources of
carbon dioxide for cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just keep in mind that carbon dioxide
is a non-flammable, colorless,
[SPEAKER_00]: odorless gas that can be in a solid or
liquid state, or gaseous state,
[SPEAKER_00]: used across various industries,
including welding, food, beverages,
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing, as well as water treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very commonly found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the options when we're looking
at enrichment, we have compressed bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage of utilizing compressed
bottles is they're typically easy to get,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're easy to find at most grow shops,
as well as many air suppliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also a pure form of carbon
dioxide, meaning just carbon dioxide is
[SPEAKER_00]: purified and then compressed in the
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not getting any sort of
by-products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage of using a compressed
bottle, though, is the transport and or
[SPEAKER_00]: refilling of the bottles can be a hassle,
especially as you get to the larger sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So compressed bottles aren't looking like
something you want to implement.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also a liquid carbon dioxide to
consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, liquid carbon dioxide is a very dense
and pure form of carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the densest, purest forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great, great source in that
regards.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantage is it's
difficult to get and can require special
[SPEAKER_00]: holding equipment and refrigeration on
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically, liquid carbon dioxide is
reserved for larger operations where they
[SPEAKER_00]: need the density of carbon dioxide because
they don't want to store, they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: have limited storage areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are additional equipments that
is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's propane as a carbon dioxide
source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, utilizing propane, this can also
provide heat as a source when it's burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to give you some heat and
additionally enrich your area with carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages is that this
will also increase humidity and also
[SPEAKER_00]: potential by-products of other gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also consider the questions, what if heat
is not needed in your grow space,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in the summer?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what if the heat is only needed at
night or the lights off period?
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon dioxide can only efficiently be
utilized by plants during the lights on
[SPEAKER_00]: period or during when sunlight exposure
occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're adding carbon dioxide,
or burning propane as heat, thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: you're adding carbon dioxide, you are,
but the plants really are not able to take
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of it, which can also cause
considerations if you're needing to
[SPEAKER_00]: supplement carbon dioxide in the summer
months where heat is not needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, there are biological carbon
dioxide generation sources as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage is it's a passive form of
carbon dioxide generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to be pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage though is it's an
inconsistent production, meaning these are
biodegradable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're biologically generated,
so they're biological systems that need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be fed and they might produce more one day
and less another day and also temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a not regulated form of carbon
dioxide, meaning you could get a lot in
[SPEAKER_00]: one area and not a lot the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep these in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn more about any of
them, check out other videos on this
[SPEAKER_00]: channel where you can learn more about the
details to determine the best source of
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide for your growing operation.
