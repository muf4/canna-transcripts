[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at binomial
nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you break these two words down by
meaning two, nomial referring to name,
[SPEAKER_00]: and nomenclature is this system of naming,
you can begin to make sense of this and
[SPEAKER_00]: what this is going to be all about,
and how important this is for biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with in general, names were
based on Latin or ancient Greek words,
[SPEAKER_00]: and scientists everywhere understood these
languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to use terms that are
interchangeable, and that's across
[SPEAKER_00]: regions, languages, for naming our
organisms so that no matter where you are
[SPEAKER_00]: located in the world, where you may be
doing research, scientists all over can
[SPEAKER_00]: know exactly what you're referring to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first word of the scientific name
is the species name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the name of the genus to which the
organism belongs to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genus name refers to the relatively
small group of organisms to which a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular type of organism belongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that from our classifications and
our kingdoms, phylomes, and families,
[SPEAKER_00]: how this relates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking specifically here at the
naming of the first word referring to the
[SPEAKER_00]: genus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second word is the name of the
species, and this is a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: identifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Species names are usually a Latin
description of some important
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics of that particular
organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans here, you'd see homo sapiens,
homo being the genus, and sapiens is
[SPEAKER_00]: referring to these species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm applying this to another example and
allowing you to understand some more of
[SPEAKER_00]: the rules associated with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we use the Latin name for an
organism, we always capitalize the genus,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the first part, but not the
species identifier, which is the second
[SPEAKER_00]: part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also print the name in italics or
underline them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use italics if you're using a computer,
or if you're writing them on a test quiz
[SPEAKER_00]: or any handwritten, we would underline
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, Acer rubrum, which is the
scientific name for a red maple tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is again the common name,
would look like this if you were writing
[SPEAKER_00]: it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were typing it, you would use the
italics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acer is the Latin name for maple,
that's again the genus, and rubrum is the
[SPEAKER_00]: Latin word for red, and that's referring
to the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain ones can also be abbreviated as we
can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A period and rubrum referring to our
beautiful, in the fall at least,
[SPEAKER_00]: red maple trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans are named homo sapiens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Homo because of our large brain and
upright posture, where that's derived
[SPEAKER_00]: from, and sapiens because our intelligence
and ability to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a Star Wars fan, Qui-Gon Jinn
quote right here, the ability to speak
[SPEAKER_00]: does not make you necessarily intelligent,
but we also said our large brain,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this gives you an example of our
cerebral cortex, the amount of neurons
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have in billions compared to a
couple other species here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the elephant, the monkey,
and the chimpanzee.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 16.3 billion, which is much larger
than any of these other different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: How this might look, myself up here,
how this might look is there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: information that can be conveyed in a very
short space.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just one example of the Colorado
potato beetle, which is actually a major
[SPEAKER_00]: pest insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see our kingdom, our phylum,
our class, our order, our family,
[SPEAKER_00]: our genus, our species, and all the
numbers corresponding correspond here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, we're able to determine
what kingdom it's in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an animal, and then get very
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the binomial name, and that's
referring to, again, you'll notice it's in
[SPEAKER_00]: italics because it is typed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first word is capitalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a space, and then we have our
second word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our naming authority, and when it was
potentially named, who named it,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of this information can be kept very
quick and easy, and it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: card-like format with the addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be very helpful for looking at
doing research or trying to identify and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about this specific insect so that
people all over the world know exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting in how to properly write binomial
nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example of, again, humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is incorrect because it's all
written as one solid word.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second example here is wrong because
even though it's two separate words,
[SPEAKER_00]: we notice the first word here is not
capitalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third version is capitalized and does
have a space, but because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: handwritten, it is not underlined.
[SPEAKER_00]: This last one here indicates the correct
and proper way to write binomial
[SPEAKER_00]: nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_00]: First word capitalized, space to the
second word.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second word is lowercase, and both
words are underlined.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were typing this on a computer,
we could italicize them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at our taxonomy and nomenclature,
they're closely aligned, but separate in
[SPEAKER_00]: complementary endeavors in developing the
language of biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nomenclature is a system for giving names
to organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taxonomy is the branch of biology that
identifies and names organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming together, we get able to develop
the type of specimen so that we're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get away from the use of common names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it might be easier to
understand, certain species and different
[SPEAKER_00]: species may have overlapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: This nomenclature and taxonomy come
together as we're able to, as scientists,
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about the same thing, regardless of
our geographic location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
