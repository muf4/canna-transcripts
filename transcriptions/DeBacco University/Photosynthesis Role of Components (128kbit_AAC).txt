[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're looking at the equation
for photosynthesis, which you hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: are becoming more familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video lecture, we're going to go
over some of the roles of these components
[SPEAKER_00]: and why they're needed to be able to carry
out this necessary process for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking specifically at the first one,
carbon dioxide is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, carbon dioxide enters through the
stomata of the leaf, and it's got to make
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of a journey to get to where
it's needed to be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, it's going through the stroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's diffusing through the cell wall,
and then the membrane, and then to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoplasm before finally reaching the
chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a little bit of a process that
is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, carbon dioxide is the source of
carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the lignin and carbon sources
for the sugars, polysaccharides,
[SPEAKER_00]: monosaccharides, disaccharides,
all comes from the carbon of carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as we increase a concentration of
carbon dioxide that a plant may be
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing, we notice the rate of
photosynthesis will also increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's a certain point,
point of saturation here, it begins to
[SPEAKER_00]: plateau.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're adding more carbon dioxide,
but our photosynthetic rate is not
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It levels off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be due to certain limiting
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be water to the plant,
it could be nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certain limiting factors that
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see in this graph here, it ties it
with a little bit of numbers, our ambient
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide level is about 410 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of in this range.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there is some benefit to
adding increased levels of carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's a certain point where our
rate just maxes out and plateaus there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just know that carbon dioxide is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be diffused to get to the
chloroplast, and is the source of carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: for this process to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another very important component is water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used for many purposes in a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less than 1% goes to the photosynthesis
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most goes for cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine that plants are receiving the
light, they're generating a lot of heat
[SPEAKER_00]: with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through their transpiration process,
they're able to cool themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is also the source of electrons,
which as you remember are on the outer
[SPEAKER_00]: shell here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are valence electrons of our atom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember in our nucleus is our protons and
neutrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxygen is a byproduct, because we're going
to be splitting water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And limiting water can directly limit this
photosynthetic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reason being, when a plant is turgid or
has enough water, the guard cells open the
[SPEAKER_00]: stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great because it allows carbon
dioxide in, allows oxygen to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in addition to oxygen leaving,
water will also be leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a plant becomes water stressed,
those guard cells become shrunken and
[SPEAKER_00]: close off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's eliminating water from leaving,
but it's also preventing oxygen from
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving and carbon dioxide from entering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this water can directly impact the
stomata, which can impact the rate that
[SPEAKER_00]: that photosynthesis can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light is another necessary component.
[SPEAKER_00]: And light has many different wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all colors are used in the same
proportion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Longer wavelengths are reds and oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our shorter wavelengths are our
violets, our indigos, and our blues.
[SPEAKER_00]: ROYGBIV, red, orange, yellow, green,
blue, indigo, and violet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our increase in here, an energy,
with our shorter wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So X-rays and UV rays have more energy
than do our infrared rays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to see that the
chlorophyll uses different parts of this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that actually look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the graphs and charts that
would look like here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is the site where all this is
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very important component.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has properties similar to hemoglobin in
our own bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chloroplast structures are where this is
actually occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's different types of
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll A is the dominant chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here that represented by the
absorbance in the solid line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll notice it's this blue to kind of
dark, dark green color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it drops off when we get to greens and
yellows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we notice another spike for
chlorophyll A in the red spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the absorption lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we talk about different wavelengths
that are measured in nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is showing the specific colors
that chlorophyll A has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll A is able to absorb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll B allows the photosynthetic
process to occur over a broader spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: of light as energy is transferred to
chlorophyll A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now chlorophyll B is these long dashed
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll notice the peaks for chlorophyll
B are close to but different than
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll A.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this is allowing the plant to do is
absorb different wavelengths of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And beta-carotene also is slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now plants are mostly green color because
they're reflecting a lot of that green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants don't absorb a lot of that green
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see strong in the reds and the blues
are the wavelengths or the light energy
[SPEAKER_00]: that plants are typically absorbing at a
greater percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the world's component is the electron
transport chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our electron transport chain,
it's non-cyclic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it only goes in one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to put a picture here of one direction
to help you realize that this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: electron transport chain is only
progressing in one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it occurring?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're back to our chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to keep yourself oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the stroma is the aqueous fluid
surrounding the granum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thylakoid lumen is occurring
inside, in the case it's represented by
[SPEAKER_00]: the red here, inside the actual thylakoid,
inside those actual disks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at a phospholipid
bilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be investigating the
proteins embedded in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because here our thylakoid lumen is
on the lower side and our stroma is on the
[SPEAKER_00]: upper side, don't think that's always the
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that these proteins could be
down here and it could flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be able to orient yourself,
depending on what picture that I give you,
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep in mind that the thylakoid lumen
is inside those disks and the stroma is on
[SPEAKER_00]: the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this electron transport chain that we
see is producing an end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see in the Kelvin cycle,
for example, things need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the case here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a transport chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It occurs only in one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be a little confusing right
now, and that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm stressing the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's non-cyclic electron transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing our light energy exciting our
electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see all these arrows going one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're re-exciting that electron and moving
over here, producing an end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is non-cyclic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the Z scheme because it kind
of looks like a Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this may seem a little confusing
right now initially, if you come back to
[SPEAKER_00]: this video after watching some of my
others, hopefully you'll be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what the photo systems are
doing, what some of the necessary proteins
[SPEAKER_00]: are also contributing to be able to allow
this necessary process for life to occur.
