[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to talk about viruses
and how they relate to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while this is a very broad category,
I'm going to try to single out a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: things to focus in on.
[SPEAKER_00]: One here being kind of a modeled look to
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of what one virus,
tobacco mosaic, looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the reasons why it's not easy to
identify is there's many different viruses
[SPEAKER_00]: that can cause different visual symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you mentioned here, the modeling is
one, but this isn't true for necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: all viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the virus itself can only be seen
with an electron microscope or other very
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely fine viewing microscopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your traditional light microscopes that
you may have used to look at cells in say
[SPEAKER_00]: a biology class will not be able to see
viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are extremely, extremely small.
[SPEAKER_00]: This indication here is 0.2 micrometers,
extremely small viewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to use very specialized
equipment to go to positively identify the
[SPEAKER_00]: virus itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now where to look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, you'll see a modeled look to
the leaves, even though there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: variability, but modeled look is one
relative consistency across many different
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, viruses often do not kill the plant
entirely, but they can reduce the yields
[SPEAKER_00]: and cause odd visual characteristics that
develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: These leaves should be nice even
coloration, and we can see that modeled
[SPEAKER_00]: look definitely evident here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here in Canvas, we see kind of one
portion being kind of that weird kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: coloration look to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, prevention of the vectors,
insects and tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is important, aphids are a very common
virus vector or carrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can cause spreading through an entire
grow facility very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, smoking tobacco in a grow area is
not advised as the smoke can transmit
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times you'll see no smoking
signs in tobacco fields, which may seem
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of counterintuitive, but it's because
of the fear of tobacco mosaic,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can transmit through the smoke of
this cigarette here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For control, since viruses only deal with
DNA wrapped in a protein coat,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's really nothing to kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really kill a virus because it's
not necessarily living to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So control does not have to do with the
virus particles, but those things that may
[SPEAKER_00]: transmit the particles, those things that
may carry it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a way to prevent a virus infection,
to go back, would be to prevent aphids or
[SPEAKER_00]: control your aphids, which is an insect,
not necessarily a virus itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's vectoring that virus particle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also yourself or tools that may come
from an infected area, try to clean those,
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilize those in a way to kind of limit
that potential unwanted
[SPEAKER_00]: cross-contamination from a virus infected
plant to another plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You yourself should be mindful that simply
dipping your hands in milk is one way
[SPEAKER_00]: growers for tobacco fields have been able
to reduce the spread of virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all things to consider, because once
you get it, while it may not kill the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, it definitely will have a negative
impact on the plant's performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
