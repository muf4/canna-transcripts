[SPEAKER_00]: While this is entitled, How Scientists
Think, it's important to realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists do think a little differently
and all have their different kind of ways
[SPEAKER_00]: to approach things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of how scientists think and
how scientists approach certain problems
[SPEAKER_00]: or issues and how that kind of can look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's investigate this a little
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do scientists think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's kind of two main ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have deductive reasoning, which
involves telling stories based on
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: This uses accepted general principles as a
guide to explain specific observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts out more general and progresses
to become more specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example would be, all humans are
mortal, Albert Einstein is human,
[SPEAKER_00]: therefore Einstein is mortal, using this
deductive reasoning pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's forming a general theory of
explanation based on specific observations
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been made previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deductive reasoning here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opposite of this would be inductive
reasoning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's inductive reasoning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is recognizing patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: This uses, by scientists, developed
hypothesis about how the world works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starts with a specific observation and
progresses to a broader generalizations
[SPEAKER_00]: and theories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, what's an example of how this may
look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a poll shows that 75% of students at
school X take the bus to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aaron goes to school X.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, Aaron probably takes the bus to
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of inductive reasoning,
making a specific prediction based on a
[SPEAKER_00]: general principle believed to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inductive reasoning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do these kind of two compare?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you look above here, we can see
that the deductive reason stated as facts
[SPEAKER_00]: or general principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inductive reasoning is based more on
observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for conclusion wise, conclusion is
more special than information and premise
[SPEAKER_00]: provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is reached directly by applying
logical rules to the premise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's deductive reasoning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inductive, we've noticed these more
general information that the premise
[SPEAKER_00]: provides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's reached by a generalization of the
premise information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Validity and deductive reasoning,
it must be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: For inductive reasoning, it's probably
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we saw the example there with 75% of
students taking the bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're assuming it's probably true that
Aaron takes the bus because we have 75% of
[SPEAKER_00]: students taking the bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, for his usage, deductive reasoning
is using one of these facts that are
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inductive reasoning is an evidence instead
of proven facts to help support that
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusion that's reached.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a quick comparison between
deductive and inductive reasoning,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is you could see how scientists tend
to take a little bit more of this
[SPEAKER_00]: inductive reasoning approach because we
don't know everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't be 100% sure of everything that
would be common to the deductive reasoning
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
