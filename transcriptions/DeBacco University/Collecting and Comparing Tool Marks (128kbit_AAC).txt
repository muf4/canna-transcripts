[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we'll be looking at collecting
and comparing tool marks, which often are
[SPEAKER_00]: very important pieces of evidence in a
crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, a tool mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's defined as any impression,
cut, gouge, or abrasion caused by a tool
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in contact with another object,
and they are typically found in forced
[SPEAKER_00]: entry scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here a door kind of prying it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the tool marks definitely left here
to help open that door when it was
[SPEAKER_00]: probably in the locked position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we compare tool marks,
again, there's a lot of different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: tools, but tool mark impressions can
reveal class characteristics or the size
[SPEAKER_00]: and shape of the tool, because,
for example, a crowbar is going to leave a
[SPEAKER_00]: much larger impression than a small
screwdriver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, we're unable to connect the
marks to one specific tool unless there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a random nick or break that tool has
acquired, giving it individual
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look here at a pair of bolt cutters
that were used to cut a locked shackle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comparison micro photograph shows
evidence of the locked shackle on the left
[SPEAKER_00]: side and the test cut produced by the bolt
cutters and a piece of lead on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that there's definitely a
pretty close match on many of those ridges
[SPEAKER_00]: and valleys there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at unique wear patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: The edges of a tool display microscopic
irregularities that look like ridges and
[SPEAKER_00]: valleys as a result of the manufacturing
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a normal kind of end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damage and wear of the tool when used
creates a variety of unique patterns,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, again, can help with the
identification or matching process.
[SPEAKER_00]: These imperfections can be used to
identify individual tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here a knife edge from a
suspect's knife when compared or matched
[SPEAKER_00]: to a piece of a rib cage from a victim.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're noticing these region valleys have a
lot of similar characteristics and almost
[SPEAKER_00]: directly match up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this can be used to help tie in a
particular knife to a crime scene,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just a knife to a crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're doing these comparisons,
it's important that when a tool is scraped
[SPEAKER_00]: against a softer surface, it may cut a
series of striated lines that reflect the
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern of the tool's edge, as we can see
here, and compared using a comparison
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope with test tool marks made by
the suspect's weapon to see if there are,
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact, ridges and valleys that can be
matched up.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the image we see here where the line
splits the left to the right, you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of consistencies there in that
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, problems with tool mark comparisons
are that they can be difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: duplicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tool mark left at the crime scene in
the laboratory must make test marks of
[SPEAKER_00]: various angles and different pressures to
see if a match can be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a lot of different kind of
cut mark shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Y cuts and T cuts and V shapes,
and a lot of this comes down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure, the angle, and it can be hard to
recreate all those exact kind of factors
[SPEAKER_00]: in a lab, and this is why typically
multiple lab laceration marks need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: made, multiple impressions need to be made
in the lab to be able to compare it to
[SPEAKER_00]: what was found at the crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as collecting of tool mark evidence,
the entire object or part of the object
[SPEAKER_00]: bearing the tool mark should be submitted
to the laboratory for evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the tool mark cannot be removed from
the crime scene, other options such as
[SPEAKER_00]: taking a picture or making a cast should
be implemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liquid silicone, the best material to use
for casting, and a lot of detail can be
[SPEAKER_00]: lost when you're forced to use a
photograph and a cast, so it's best to
[SPEAKER_00]: have the actual image, but something is
better than nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lastly, when we have that piece of
evidence that is found, we want to be sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're handling it with care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never attempt to fit a suspect's tool into
the tool mark as it could alter the mark
[SPEAKER_00]: and question the integrity of the
evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The suspect tool and mark are packaged in
separate containers to keep from
[SPEAKER_00]: destroying their individual character
ristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be trace evidence like paint
chips on the tool or impressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Must be careful when handling packaging
evidence so you don't lose any potential
[SPEAKER_00]: trace evidence, and we can see here of a
nice little storage area for a knife that
[SPEAKER_00]: may have some blood evidence, that's why
it has the biohazard symbol, but this is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to help maintain all those potential
individual characteristics without causing
[SPEAKER_00]: any alterations, so it can be entered as
evidence in a crime scene.
