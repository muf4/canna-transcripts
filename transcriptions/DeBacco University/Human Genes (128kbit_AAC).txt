[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at a brief
overview of human genes and how they kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of interrelate and some things that can
suddenly go wrong and what affects them
[SPEAKER_00]: that we may see from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So human chromosomes, we're looking at the
somatic cells of 23 pairs of chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 pairs are autosomes and one pair is sex
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, two X's is female and an X and a
Y is male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking here, we have our 22 pairs of
autosomes and our one sex pair of
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these being X indicating this is
from a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pleiotropic effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some alleles can have different effects
depending on what source parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deletions in chromosome 15 in particular
result in these two potential types of
[SPEAKER_00]: syndromes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One if it's inherited from the father and
one if it's inherited from the mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both kind of are negatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no real positive from either,
but depending on what effects you might
[SPEAKER_00]: see, determines what parent that
particular mutation was inherited from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So intellectual impairment, behavior
problems, distinctive facial features,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see here on the hands,
triangular shape to the mouth,
[SPEAKER_00]: small hands and feet, indicate that it was
inherited from the father.
[SPEAKER_00]: Angelman syndrome is inherited from the
mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also has the same intellectual
problems, potential speech impairments,
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures, physical features can occur and
this occurs when it's inherited from the
[SPEAKER_00]: mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on what parent it comes from,
in some cases, can determine the outcome
[SPEAKER_00]: that is experienced by that offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitotic non-disjunction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the failure for chromosomes to
separate correctly during meiosis one or
[SPEAKER_00]: two is termed non-disjunction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This leads to an abnormal number of
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's how it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything lines up on the plate,
the metaphase plate perfectly separates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proper disjunction breaks apart,
no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're noticing instead of separating
out like these blue and green ones did,
[SPEAKER_00]: well two are being pulled over here during
anaphase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be non-disjunction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would cause all sorts of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example of this could be Down syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans with one less autosome are called
monosomatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these do not survive development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this does occur, it really can't get
passed on because that individual simply
[SPEAKER_00]: not survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if there's an extra autosome,
it's called trisonomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the vast majority of these don't
survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trisomy for a few chromosomes is capable
with survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's severe developmental
defects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Down syndrome is one example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trisomy in 21, you can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be XY if it was a male,
XX if it was a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part here highlighted in red is
that there are three under number 21,
[SPEAKER_00]: under chromosome 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should only be two for each.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a indicative of Down syndrome,
the karyotype for Down syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably have seen or know potentially
someone who's affected with this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because of the three copies of
chromosome 21 that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-disjunction involving six chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can lead to sterility, in the sense
where a female's a triple X, or a female
[SPEAKER_00]: just has one X, Turner syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-violable would be O and an X,
meaning a male can't just have a Y,
[SPEAKER_00]: needs an X and a Y because Y only has
about 15 or so genes, while the X is much
[SPEAKER_00]: more important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got about, there's over 2,000 genes
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Males with two X and a Y, that's another
type of syndrome there that can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This occurs because the non-disjunction
involving particularly the sex
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes, the X and the Y, either
they're separating out properly,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they're not separating out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could deal with a double Y gametes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's not inviolable, will not
survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, X, Y, Y zygotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frequency of X, Y, Y is one in a thousand
males in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are typically, phenotypically normal
because the Y can contain so few genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic screening, so this is something
that's available to parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Newborn infants can be screened for a
number of disorders, PKU.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic screening alerts new parents that
treatment may be necessary for the
[SPEAKER_00]: well-being of their infant.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, a woman pregnant for the
first time at age 35 may want to know if
[SPEAKER_00]: her baby has increased odds for Down
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultrasound as a way of looking at the
fetus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's typically this black and white image,
though there are some new ultrasounds
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out that produce more of a 3D-like
image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, you see here a syringe going
in, sampling the amniotic fluid within the
[SPEAKER_00]: womb there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually performed during the first month,
the fourth month of pregnancy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then those fluid would then be put
into the petri dish and examined further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, this is done in conjunction
with the ultrasound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this genetic screening brings up some
interesting points where if parents know
[SPEAKER_00]: potential issues with their child,
this could increase the chance for those
[SPEAKER_00]: parents selecting for or investigating the
chance for an abortion or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic screening is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of counseling on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually majors involved in
genetics counseling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once parents have that information,
what do they do with that information?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the betterment of them, the betterment
of the new unborn child, certain things to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: So carrier recognition, identification of
heterozygous state for a given trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be evident with a parent knows
that they're a carrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may know that they have increased
odds of doing that to their offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blood tests are a way that can be detected
for this, and express recessive genes to
[SPEAKER_00]: know if their particular offspring did get
unlucky carrying or having one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that they might be a carrier for
expressed in that individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the human gene therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic engineering has potential to
replace defective genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Defective cells can be infected with
genetically engineered viruses containing
[SPEAKER_00]: a functional gene as a way to replace that
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a patient's cells can be directly
injected with correct DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This occurs early on through the process
of replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gene could be corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: This though gets into the idea of ethics
on should it be done?
[SPEAKER_00]: How soon should they find out?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an important aspect because
there is that gene counseling that's
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is an important thing to keep in
mind when you're looking at, if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting this information, what are you
going to do with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what if it doesn't turn out the way you
think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is genetic engineering a possibility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would it be something to investigate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you change cells?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just all has to do with the
ethics of the individual and the person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's wise to seek out
counseling on these typical choices and
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions that will have lifelong effects
for you and your potentially unborn
[SPEAKER_00]: infant.
Thank you.
Thank you.
