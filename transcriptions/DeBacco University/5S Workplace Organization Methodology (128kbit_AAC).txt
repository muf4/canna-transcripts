[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over the 5S
workplace organization methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the five parts listed out here and
explain them each in a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind this methodology of 5S
refers to five Japanese terms used to
[SPEAKER_00]: describe the steps of the 5S system for
visual management.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the following slides, the title for the
American term will be stated and I will
[SPEAKER_00]: put the Japanese term in parentheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will only be referring to the American
term here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is basically what this is in
general, this methodology is having an
[SPEAKER_00]: organized, clean, efficient workspace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first we're going to sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to sort through your materials,
keeping only the essential items needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: complete the task.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to ask yourself, what do you
actually need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go through everything and if you do not
need it, get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think of it as like making a
survival kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, keeping only the essentials,
laying everything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I need all these different lenses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask yourself exactly what do you need to
have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's set in order and that's
organized and ensure that each item has a
[SPEAKER_00]: designated and logical place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want to keep some items you
typically use more at eye level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those you use a little bit less that are
light on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are a little heavier here at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Location of the items should be easy to
find and access and also labeling
[SPEAKER_00]: everything makes it really easy to
identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see also here with the bin system,
locating all the glue, the highlighters,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sharpies, the rulers, all very nice,
neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is set in order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proactive efforts to keep the area clean
and orderly to ensure purpose driven work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean and maintain the organized
workspace.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be also including an area for
cleaning materials and also be just having
[SPEAKER_00]: everything laid out very well and
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can involve routine tasks such as
sweeping the floor, removing dead leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: and performing maintenance on equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really what caused the operation
to shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part to make this work efficiently
is that it's proactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing this ahead of any potential
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then standardized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to create a set of standards for
both organization and process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can develop your own parameters that
fit within other previously described
[SPEAKER_00]: terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is suggested though that schedules are
a good way to approach this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a timetable, having it by the days
of the week, having it by the time of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be a great way to standardize
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much as we see here with the palettes,
for shipping, that's a standardized way to
[SPEAKER_00]: ship large products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forklifts are used and it becomes very
easy to transfer that from one place to
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's sustain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sustaining new practices and
reflect on your actual practices to ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: you're following this 5S methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: This system doesn't work unless it's
continued on a regular repeated basis over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to sustain this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to do it once and then
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to implement this and in a way it
can sustain itself so that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: continuing with this efficient workplace
environment for the long term to not only
[SPEAKER_00]: make your current employees work very
efficiently but anyone that may come in
[SPEAKER_00]: that might be new can easily pick up the
task and fit right in with everyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
