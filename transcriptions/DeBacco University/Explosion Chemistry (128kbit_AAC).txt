[SPEAKER_00]: This video here on DeBakel University is
going to focus on explosion chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at that combustion that occurs
and results in this explosion,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are some different examples of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with just chemistry of an
explosion in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, essentially a combustion reaction is
very similar to that of a fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: The major difference though is the speed
of the reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damage is caused by rapidly expanding
gases in a confined area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there is still a quote fire
present, but this combustion means that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is definitely a speed associated
with this reaction as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the explosion is a sudden release of
chemical or mechanical energy caused by an
[SPEAKER_00]: oxidation or decomposition reaction that
produces heat and rapid expansion of
[SPEAKER_00]: gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we may see it as like 4th of July
fireworks, for example, a very controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: explosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see definitely a large
fireball indicating over a large area
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there needs to be a reagent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reagent is a substance used to
produce a chemical reaction to direct
[SPEAKER_00]: measure or produce other substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's kind of that initially starting
substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have reagents also in various other
aspects of chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking to produce that
chemical reaction and reagents can be
[SPEAKER_00]: quite varied.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at a high of explosives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So high explosives are chemicals that
oxidize extremely rapidly producing heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: light, and also a shockwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look down here below me,
we can clearly see the evidence of that
[SPEAKER_00]: shockwave here of the explosions occurring
on this battleship.
[SPEAKER_00]: These will explode even if not confined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind high explosives don't have
to necessarily be confined to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: their end result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you capture that nice image
here, you can definitely see evidence of
[SPEAKER_00]: that shockwave that is present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have our low explosives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind low explosives are
chemicals that oxidize rapidly producing
[SPEAKER_00]: heat, light, and a pressure wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at kind of that pressure wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: These will explode only when they are
compressed or confined in an area there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So slight differences there from the high
explosives.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, explosives still are very
dangerous and things to be considered when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing an investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
