[SPEAKER_00]: With the potential for CO2 to increase
yields, there's a lot of products entering
[SPEAKER_00]: the marketplace that state that they
generate CO2, but a lot of the methods out
[SPEAKER_00]: there that are cheaper tend to be a very
inefficient CO2 generation method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to cover just a little bit about
what areas you should be kind of of
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're considering that adding CO2 is a
great thing or something you want to add,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are some more efficient methods and
what are some inefficient methods?
[SPEAKER_00]: So inefficient CO2 generation methods,
those methods that do generate CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they are potentially stating they're
generating CO2 and they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the amount can be inconsistent
and create variable conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically they're cheaper because you're
not using a pressurized tank or a propane
[SPEAKER_00]: to burn for heat and not really a good way
to regulate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a high variability to the
conditions that they can create.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there can be a lack of consistency,
which can help increase the odds of
[SPEAKER_00]: variable in the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you have success with one of
these systems, replicating those
[SPEAKER_00]: successful results can be quite a
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should only be considered if the grow
space is small.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, be a small grow tent and
you're operating with the idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: something is better than nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want you to think that if you get one
of these systems, typically fermentation
[SPEAKER_00]: could be an option here, that they're
going to yield kind of consistent results
[SPEAKER_00]: or they can be used in large operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're inefficient, but something is
better than nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be worth consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those methods for CO2 generation
include the active compost, fermentation
[SPEAKER_00]: using dry ice, which is solid carbon
dioxide, mixing baking soda and vinegar,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's some other proprietary
products out there also.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, all of these are poorly regulated
and only have a chance to work in very
[SPEAKER_00]: small spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry ice or solid CO2, you might think,
oh, that's just perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, how hot and where it's being
released and how much is being released,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can cause some issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Active compost and fermentation,
yes, it is releasing CO2, but based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: sugars you feed them microbes,
based on the release, based on the mixing,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of these aren't regulated for day
and night cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I consider all these to be
inefficient methods of generating CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: because while they do generate some carbon
dioxide, I guess something is better than
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're really looking at
efficiencies, you might want to consider
[SPEAKER_00]: other options that are more precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while they may cost more initially,
they will ensure more consistent results.
Thank you.
