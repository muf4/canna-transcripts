[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to touch on the types of
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a general, quick, short summary,
there are many different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping in mind that the types of proteins
can be defined by their shape because that
[SPEAKER_00]: will help determine potentially their
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just general types of proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they all have different functions
but share the same building blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those building blocks are amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some examples are classifications of
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be used as enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be used for transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some proteins are structural, such as
collagen or keratin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are used for defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are contractile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking again at our specific types of
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, ribosomes are important for protein
assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be free-floating in the cytosol.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also be attached to the
endoplasmic reticulum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robisco is a type of protein that's
involved in the photosynthetic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pepsin is an enzyme found in your stomach
to help break down food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actin filaments are structural components
of your hair, giving it its strength
[SPEAKER_00]: despite its very small diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And insulin is important for regulation of
your blood glucose levels, all specific
[SPEAKER_00]: types in relation to proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's two main
classifications when we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: protein structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the structural ones, which are
long cables that provide shape and
[SPEAKER_00]: strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, as I just gave,
your hair has these long cable-like
[SPEAKER_00]: structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's your globular hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are grooves and depressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These kind of form this more
three-dimensional, globe-like shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are typically enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also hemoglobin has this type of
classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protein functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three examples of protein
functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some proteins transport various
substances, such as oxygen, ions,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This example provided here is hemoglobin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hemoglobin is a very specific shape
that it takes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the heme units, the iron units.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is important in your red blood
cells for carrying oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as its structure relates to function,
so shape has a direct impact on function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal red blood cells have this nice
cross-section.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call this biconcave disc.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have this abnormal condition
called sickle cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have this weird sickle kind of
half-moon shape to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it greatly impacts the function of red
blood cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a normal red blood cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here we have the sickle-shaped
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The normal red blood cells are smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they're called biconcave disc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they move very easily through our
capillaries and through our vessels,
[SPEAKER_00]: arteries, and veins in our circulatory
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can transfer oxygen very
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sickle cell shapes, if you have sickle
cell anemia, don't move easily through the
[SPEAKER_00]: blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're stiff and sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to form these clumps and get
stuck in blood vessels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can block blood flow, blood vessels,
to limbs, to organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can cause serious infection or
organ damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not a good condition to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you could just look at the shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as efficient at carrying oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another function of proteins can be
information transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give the example here of certain
protein hormones or peptide hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insulin is an example, because it helps
control the amount of sugar in the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your body needs to maintain homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to maintain a very controlled
amount of blood glucose levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insulin will help keep that in check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also important for defense in the form of
antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It marks foreign bodies for elimination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have our antigens and our
antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are very important shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see here, these are all
distinctive shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, again, relates to proteins here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, our protein functions,
they can form a catalyst.
[SPEAKER_00]: So almost all of the chemical reactions
that are in a living cell are catalyzed by
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, what an enzyme does is it
reduces the amount of energy needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: reach an end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here to combine A with B without the
enzyme would take this much energy before
[SPEAKER_00]: it produced the complex AB.
[SPEAKER_00]: With enzymes here, taking a lot less
energy to produce the same end result.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example, we'll notice that the
time it takes to produce with or without
[SPEAKER_00]: the enzyme is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what is reduced is the amount of
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without enzymes, we would not be able to
survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
