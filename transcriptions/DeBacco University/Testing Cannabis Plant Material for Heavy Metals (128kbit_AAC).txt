[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
we're going to be looking at testing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant material for heavy metals
and some research articles surrounding
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into testing cannabis
plant material for heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as always, we have one scientific
article here providing a brief summary on
[SPEAKER_00]: the following slides, as well as a couple
other research articles we provided in
[SPEAKER_00]: this video lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the basics here of
cannabis being used for phyto remediation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This phyto remediation refers to the
procedures which employ plants to scavenge
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals from the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have soil that's contaminated with
heavy metals using plants phyto to
[SPEAKER_00]: remediate or remove some of those heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This technique depends on the ability of
certain plants to sequester heavy metals
[SPEAKER_00]: from the soil so that when food producing
crops are planted, there ideally be no
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals in that particular crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of picture here kind of
simplifies it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metal immobilization and toxicity is
reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're then taking up those heavy metals,
assembling them in the plant, then cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: down and removing this particular plant
with an efficient way to kind of pull the
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavy metals can be very difficult to
extract in the soil with other means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants can be efficient at uptaking that
by removing this plant and discarding
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, we've phyto remediated,
we've used plants to remediate the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: remove those heavy metals, take this plant
material, cart that off site, and that can
[SPEAKER_00]: allow us to utilize this soil to be used
for food crops with very low chance of any
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals accumulating in those
subsequent crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at heavy metal
accumulation in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So however, this does lead to
concentration of heavy metals in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants material where they can later
reside in products derived from the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that if we're using phyto
remediation with cannabis, which can be
[SPEAKER_00]: effective, it is taking up those heavy
metals, taking up those pollutants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but can accumulate them not only in the
plant material, but potentially in end
[SPEAKER_00]: products that could be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is important to understand that some
metals are beneficial, essential for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others are highly toxic and have negative
effects on good health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants do need certain metals,
but typically not the heavy metals like
[SPEAKER_00]: zinc or high amounts of zinc, I should
say, cadmium, lead, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has good phyto remediation
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they can remove heavy metals from
the soil with minimal adverse effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what makes it great as a
potential use or potential good plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize in a phyto remediation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to be cautious because it can,
great at pulling those out of the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it can accumulate those in potential
beneficial plant parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use your exposure to heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we so concerned about heavy
metals?
[SPEAKER_00]: The user may be exposed to unhealthy
levels of potentially toxic heavy metals
[SPEAKER_00]: by smoking or other produced cannabis
products from contaminated plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: For user safety, it has become standard
practice to analyze cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material, as well as products derived from
them for a number of heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just see here just heavy metals in
general, where it could be generated from,
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial product, electronic waste,
could be direct contact, could be plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: could be aquatic animals, could affect
adults, children, and also unborn children
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the heavy metals tested for?
[SPEAKER_00]: In typical, most commonly they're tested
for is lead, cadmium, mercury,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as arsenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, depending upon which state is
involved, this testing list of heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals might be longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: These aren't the only heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the typical common four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others may have more stringent standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the analysis techniques when
we're looking at heavy metals?
[SPEAKER_00]: ICP, either the OES or the MS are
techniques capable of measuring multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: elements simultaneously and are these
preferred methods where multiple or
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-heavy metal measurements are desired
and is regarded to have the best
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitivity and is the method used in many
modern laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not just testing just for arsenic or
just for lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to test multiple of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ICP is a great method for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Food and Drug Administration,
FDA, and the USP, United States
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmacopeia have standardized methods for
heavy metal analysis, which are very
[SPEAKER_00]: useful researches in the emerging cannabis
industry where regulation has been a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: slow to kind of catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of getting into the
regulations of heavy metal testing in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis products because we want to make
sure the test we're getting is an accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: representation of what is or is not in
that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is looking at another research
article, but really just at the abstract
[SPEAKER_00]: because only the abstract was publicly
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, welcome to look at this,
looking at the mycorrhizae comparison and
[SPEAKER_00]: metal accumulation changes in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did the study investigate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the effect of mycorrhizae on heavy
metal uptake and translocation was
[SPEAKER_00]: investigated in cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp is grown in the presence and absence
of 100 micrograms of cadmium and nickel
[SPEAKER_00]: and 300 micrograms of chromium sex here
and inoculated or with the fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: glomerulus mosaes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is mycorrhizae?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in general as a quick summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here we have our plant, here we have
our roots, no colonization, no
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just see the roots kind of being able
to produce certain extradates,
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to uptake whatever is
immediately surrounding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage of mycorrhizae associations
with those roots is it expands the net,
[SPEAKER_00]: the network that these roots have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to get basically water more
efficiently as well as other nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: more efficiently simply because there's a
greater exposure of surface area to the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil environment, to that root zone
compared to those that do not have an
[SPEAKER_00]: association with mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at mycorrhizae
colonization, hemp growth was reduced in
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculated plants and the reduction was
related to the degree of mycorrhizae
[SPEAKER_00]: colonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: The percentage of mycorrhizae colonization
was 42% and 9% in plants grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: non-contaminated and contaminated soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: This suggests a significant negative
effect of high metal concentrations on
[SPEAKER_00]: plant infections by the mycorrhizae
fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, soil pH, metal
bioavailability, and plant metal uptake
[SPEAKER_00]: were not influenced by the presence of
this mycorrhizae association.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when I say this is a fungus,
it is a very small fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it looks very large on the pictures
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does work with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can visually see it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can visually see the vesicles and the
hyphae of the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a symbiotic relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fungus is getting more nutrients
and, in this case, metals for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In exchange, the plant provides sugars so
the fungus can more easily grow and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mycorrhizae enhances translocations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the specifics of that study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants grown in artificially contaminated
soil accumulated most metal in the root
[SPEAKER_00]: organ, so the root region.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this soil, mycorrhizae significantly
enhanced the translocation of all three
[SPEAKER_00]: metals from the root to the shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very important point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That mycorrhizae is great at accessing
different parts of the soil, accumulating
[SPEAKER_00]: those metals, but what they noticed was
that in the soil that had the mycorrhizae
[SPEAKER_00]: added to it, there was enhanced or
improved more translocation, more movement
[SPEAKER_00]: of all three metals from just the root
environment up into the shoot and upper
[SPEAKER_00]: portions of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The possibility to increase metal
accumulation in shoot is very interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: for phyto-extraction purposes since most
high-producing biomass plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as non-mycorrhizae hemp, retain most
of the heavy metals in the roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: limiting their application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this translocation is a very important
kind of discovery here as far as being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to move those nutrients from just the
root environment up into the upper
[SPEAKER_00]: portions of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that here in this diagram where
we're seeing kind of the heavy metals and
[SPEAKER_00]: we see them being translocated up here and
transported to upper portions of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's another research article,
a little more current, and the last one
[SPEAKER_00]: that looks at the non-essential heavy
metal contaminants in industrial chemists'
[SPEAKER_00]: bioeconomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they looked at kind of mitigation of
heavy metal uptake suggestions,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to kind of reduce the ability for
heavy metals to be uptake and translocated
[SPEAKER_00]: through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recommended avoiding the use of
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: The previous study shown, which I just
discussed, showed enhanced translocation
[SPEAKER_00]: of cadmium, nickel, and chromium-6 from
the roots to the shoot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it helps move those heavy metals into
the upper portions of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is something ideally we really would
not want to have happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep it in the roots, remove that
plant perfectly fine, but as it gets into
[SPEAKER_00]: those upper portions, it can get into
other vital plant components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other suggestions that they provided here
was to avoid the use of acrobacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is another trigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: For increased uptake of cannabis
associated with this strain has been shown
[SPEAKER_00]: to committedly enhance plant growth,
accumulation of cadmium and zinc in fiber
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another additive, another bacteria
that can help increase the uptake and
[SPEAKER_00]: translocation of heavy metals in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to avoid inoculation of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also want to be monitoring the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the farmer must perform a robust soil
test as well as monitoring field
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions such as field soil pH,
weather conditions related to rainwater or
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irrigation water pHs and things like that
are also things that should be monitored
[SPEAKER_00]: and carefully monitored.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned, there's pH
modifications for injection and irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is a syphilic and basically in
the uptake of lead and mercury in plants
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred at pH below the level of six,
thus ensuring that the pH stays above a
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.5 level and all chemo injection
practices can mitigate lead and also
[SPEAKER_00]: mercury absorption in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we say chemo injection,
this is like growers who are looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizing with water, fertilizing with
water that has a fertilizer added to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The suggestion here is to keep that pH
above 6.5 to reduce the uptake and
[SPEAKER_00]: absorption of lead and mercury by cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last mitigation heavy metal
uptake that they suggested would be
[SPEAKER_00]: coupling ozone water treatment with water
softener system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ozone water treatment could help oxidize
these heavy metals in irrigation water and
[SPEAKER_00]: coupled ionized system with a water
softener system could help remove oxidized
[SPEAKER_00]: forms of heavy metals before they're
delivered to the cannabis crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just another way to mitigate or reduce
the amount of heavy metal uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So heavy metals are a great concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is a great potential use for
phytoremediation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to keep in mind of the factors
that cause the translocation of these
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals and limit the use of those
upper portions of the plant, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: any plant material grown indoors or
outdoors, making sure we're getting proper
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical tests that test for the
presence of these heavy metals and making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure we're staying below any thresholds
that are set.
Thank you.
