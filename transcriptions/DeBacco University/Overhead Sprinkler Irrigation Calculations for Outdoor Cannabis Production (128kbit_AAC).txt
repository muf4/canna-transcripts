[SPEAKER_00]: If you're choosing to use overhead
irrigation, there's some calculations you
[SPEAKER_00]: should be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, here at Tobacco University,
we'll help you understand those
[SPEAKER_00]: calculations better so you can be smart
with your usage of your overhead
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into overhead sprinkler
irrigation calculations for outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see a nice image here of some
overhead irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice mist there in the sun, creating that
nice rainbow effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, before you get the calculator,
keep in mind that you do need to know a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the spacing of your lateral lines,
the sprinkler nozzle size, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure of the system being operated.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these basically factor into these
calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this pressure when it's being operated
is the discharge rate of sprinkler heads
[SPEAKER_00]: will increase with the higher pressure and
larger nozzle size.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we see some examples here, increasing
in nozzle size increases the gallons per
[SPEAKER_00]: minute, or the flow rate, and as well as
the pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using the same nozzle size but
increasing the pressure, we can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is an increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not be quite as great as the
diameter of the nozzle, but there is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely a fluctuation there,
and that will play into these
[SPEAKER_00]: calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the application rate calculation here,
how do we go about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we're looking at the sprinkler
application rate, inches per hour equals
[SPEAKER_00]: the discharge rate in gallons per minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Times 96.3, divided by the lateral spacing
in feet, times the head spacing in feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what does this kind of all correlate
and mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have a nice little kind of
example, kind of chart here, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment used in this example is a
Rainbird 20JH with a 764-inch nozzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The operating pressure, 45 PSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lateral spacing, 40 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the head spacing would be 30
feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The discharge rate from the sprinkler head
from the data table here would be 2.63
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons per minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I get that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, knowing the diameter of the nozzle
and knowing the pressure gets to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons per minute at 2.63.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take that number and we multiply it by
96.3, divide it by 30 feet times 40 feet,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this would be giving us a coverage of
0.21 inches per hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this allows us to calculate the
application rate and know what's being
[SPEAKER_00]: delivered to our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprinkler application rate, inches per
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it'd be 0.21 inches per
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can use that to determine the
duration that we want to keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: sprinkler on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we know how much we want to give
those plants based on the soil type,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the age of the plants and also the
environmental conditions as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a summary reference table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, how can we kind of put this together?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to estimate the application rate for
an irrigation system, again, using the
[SPEAKER_00]: Rainbird 20JH sprinkler heads,
we can see this provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Application rates for sprinkler systems
using these heads at varying pressures,
[SPEAKER_00]: nozzle sizes, and lateral and head
spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, this is just applying those
calculations here and putting it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're not using these specific
sprinkler heads, again, use these as a
[SPEAKER_00]: general guide and then see how yours
particularly fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only mentioning this one here because
it's able to find this nice, neat,
[SPEAKER_00]: organized data table to provide you with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the rate determines the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the application rate can be used to
determine how long the duration to
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigate a crop from estimates of crop
water usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suggested starting point is to plan for
one inch of water during a typical week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is kind of the starting rate for
cannabis, one inch per water per week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can determine to increase it or
decrease it from that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: A grow with an application rate of 0.22
inches per hour will need to irrigate four
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half hours to get to that one inch
per week during the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that means your plants should be
irrigated for a duration of total,
[SPEAKER_00]: given this rate, about four and a half
hours per week.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean every Monday they get
four and a half hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to space that over the
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in that seven days, it should be have
four and a half hours of irrigation time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For cannabis, some growers suggest
starting at 0.36 inches of water per day,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this can depend on many factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be dependent on the soil type,
the season, the stage of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that needs to be taken into
consideration from a grower's standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to select a starting place and
make adjustments from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I recommend that one inch per
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can determine how the plants are
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't need to irrigate a little bit more,
a little bit less, but at least that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: good, stable starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing your soil, the season,
the plant development all will play into
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what fine-tuning adjustments you
make from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least, hopefully, this will provide
you with a starting point to allow you to
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently water the plants without
wasting water, which is a precious
[SPEAKER_00]: resource, and now over-irrigating the
plants and also not keeping them too dry.
