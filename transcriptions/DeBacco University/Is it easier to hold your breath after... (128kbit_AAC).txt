[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, for those playing the home game,
here's the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it easier to hold your breath after
inhalation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it easier to hold your breath after
exhalation?
[SPEAKER_00]: See, and you can try it out for yourself
and see which method allows you to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: your breath for longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest you pause the video here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to see it pass out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, moving on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go with the science on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is it easier to hold your breath,
hopefully you found, after inhalation?
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to hold your breath
longer than after you exhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your body actually cannot detect low
oxygen, but it is very sensitive to high
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your brain actually uses blood carbon
dioxide as an indicator for blood oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when CO2 levels are too high,
you are signaled to take a breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's assuming when CO2 levels are high
that oxygen levels are low.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of the exchange that's going
on in the capillaries of your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's prove the concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you think that, well,
I think my body can sense the oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing to do with carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider carbon monoxide poisoning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens because you're breathing air
with low oxygen, and believe it or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: the carbon dioxide CO2 levels,
carbon monoxide is just CO.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CO2 levels are the same in your body
in which regulates your breathing as
[SPEAKER_00]: usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you die without ever realizing you were
oxygen deprived.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what happens when carbon monoxide
poisoning is so dangerous, because you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: black out without any warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just breathing along normally
because your body actually has the same
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of carbon dioxide, which is using
the sense, but your oxygen levels are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually decreasing at a very rapid and
potentially very dangerous rate with
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon monoxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the science behind the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when your lungs are full of a breath of
air, you have a high oxygen concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: in a lower carbon dioxide concentration
than your blood does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you inhale, the oxygen flows to
your blood and CO2 out of the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still exchange that occurs
because you have a large volume of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Empty lungs, after you exhale,
have a lower volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fewer carbon dioxide molecules are
needed to get the same concentration in
[SPEAKER_00]: your blood that's going to raise that
level that much quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this, carbon dioxide stops
leaving your blood faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lungs are empty, meaning the CO2
levels in your blood reach a critical
[SPEAKER_00]: level faster and causes you to need or
feel that burn of needing to breathe
[SPEAKER_00]: sooner than when you inhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still exchanging that's occurring
here, and it's through the body's ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to monitor the carbon dioxide levels and
has nothing to do with oxygen levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that here, that kind of urgent
need to breathe here, high carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: levels, that burning feeling, because your
body wants to try to reduce that carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide because it's assuming this
increase in carbon dioxide is leading to a
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease in oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can only sense and determine the carbon
dioxide levels because it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: change, believe it or not, the pH of your
blood, and that's what your body is
[SPEAKER_00]: sensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this gives you just a little
bit of a background here of is it easier
[SPEAKER_00]: to hold your breath after breathing in or
breathing out?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are in a situation,
do you have to hold your breath?
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the deepest breaths you can possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fill your lungs with a lot of air to
allow that exchange to occur for a longer
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time, giving you that ability to
not feel that urgent need to breathe until
[SPEAKER_00]: later than if you were to exhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: That concentration would increase much
quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
