[SPEAKER_00]: This Tobacco University video is for those
growers considering flipping the switch
[SPEAKER_00]: and converting from HPS or high-pressure
sodium lights to LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to walk you through some of the
changes you're going to have to consider
[SPEAKER_00]: that you might want to know ahead of time
before simply just changing out the
[SPEAKER_00]: fixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so the information for this
presentation is based off the Gavita Guide
[SPEAKER_00]: provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a downloadable paper and there's
also they did a webinar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawthorne did a webinar on YouTube with
the link provided here, the transcripts,
[SPEAKER_00]: some information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just go over some of those ideas or
tips when you're looking at making this
[SPEAKER_00]: transition from an HPS lighting to an LED
lighting setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things we want to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is this form of a lighting
manufacturer that sells both HPS and LED
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said we're looking at competing
Gavita structures here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is providing information to help
growers make the switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want you to be successful if you are
going to be making that change.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is based off the papers and the
webinar based on the same company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gavita has been known to be a top producer
of HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seeing them make the transition tip
sheet is an indication that the
[SPEAKER_00]: advancement of their LED light technology
is here to there where there could be,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you're saying here, potential for a
one-to-one replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to look beyond the fixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what are we going to be
comparing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to be looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is the Gavita SL2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a thousand watt double-ended bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's considered to be the kind of industry
standard, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a slim line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of their most advanced HPS
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be compared to their new
Gavita CT1930E, which is their LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can read all the details there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as always, a link in the description
for all of the sources are provided as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is just the general comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at purchasing both of
these, I just went to a website here and
[SPEAKER_00]: just pulled them both off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they were both of the same
voltage, 208 to 240 volt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see that the HPS light comes in
at 237.17 and the LED light at $1,516.95.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are both at the same time pulled
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just for a source of comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll do that quick grower comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, more than just the cost
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower coverage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The HPS light does a four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: The LED light does a little bit more area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four by six is stated.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,000 watts compared to 780 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, the estimated cost of
electricity per month to run the HPS would
[SPEAKER_00]: be $43.20 compared to the LED light at
$33.70.
[SPEAKER_00]: The warranty is three years on the HPS and
five years on the LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to do some quick math, one LED light
is the same cost as 6.3 HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could buy 6.3 of these or just a
little over six of these to one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the LED light does have a 20% energy
savings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take that into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, five tips for the seamless
transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mentioned adjusting temperature when
growing with LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The VPD or vapor pressure deficit as a
management tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Factoring your HVAC as well as your
dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider the effects of the letting
spectrum and the light intensity on your
[SPEAKER_00]: chosen crop to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And monitor ingest nutrition and
irrigation based on transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll cover all these in detail in this
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the change in temperature
when growing with LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS lights produce heat in high amounts,
as anyone who has used those will know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's considered to be a waste or it's
radiant heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does help heat the leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does stimulate natural foliage heating,
which would occur outside in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what mimics that type of environment
that plants are accustomed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: This drives the transpiration of the
plant, which is the plant's movement of
[SPEAKER_00]: water or nutrients through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's important to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: LED lights are still giving off some heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not no heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But high pressure sodiums definitely have
a lot to heat that leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, leaf temperature comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did some data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is pulled from the webinar there
that they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great webinar to check out if you're
interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: This graph quantifies the difference in
temperature of the leaf surface under LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: LED lights, as we can see down here,
compared to high pressure sodium lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note the same cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: A black cherry punch was used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant lighting height was also
maintained the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also ambient air temperature, as I tried
to highlight down here, was also regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the same in both rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS does produce more infrared,
which is that 700 to 850 nanometers,
[SPEAKER_00]: which results in the heating of the leaf
surface there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see kind of the average here
compared to the average here when they had
[SPEAKER_00]: an ambient temperature of 26.5 degrees
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, just rough figuring out here,
looking at a little over 24 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: In here, kind of the rough middle,
maybe just a little bit below 28 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius for the leaf temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, LED lights, they can shift the room
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers should get an infrared
temperature sensor, as we can see right
[SPEAKER_00]: here, to know what their current leaf
temperatures are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way to do a little spot
check.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it allows you to get really quick
readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to take random samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants are growing and record those
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: This data for the grower can be used to
adjust the ambient temperature of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing environment after they go through
and install LED lights to match the
[SPEAKER_00]: previous plant conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing under high intensity
discharge, it's a high pressure sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, take some readings as the plants
are actively growing, document those
[SPEAKER_00]: readings, because you might be needing to
adjust your growing room conditions to
[SPEAKER_00]: match those.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also, this temperature does impact
the VPD, or vapor pressure, or the deficit
[SPEAKER_00]: that growers want to be considering to
help manage their growing rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's an important consideration
that's often not discussed or talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about, the changing of the room
temperature that might need to be needed
[SPEAKER_00]: when making the switch to LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we use VPD?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have a video on that, not to be
self-promoting, but it goes into more
[SPEAKER_00]: detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the basics is that air can only hold a
certain amount of water vapor at a given
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature before it starts to condense
back into a liquid form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forms such as dew or rain, if we're used
to being seen outside in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the air gets hotter, the amount of
water that the air can hold does increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as the air cools down, the air cannot
hold as much water vapor, and that's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of what reaches kind of this graph here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why there's dew over everything
after a cool morning, the air just is too
[SPEAKER_00]: full of water and the water condenses out
of that air.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of just a quick little
comparison here of temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: relative humidity and kind of the green
zone here would be kind of where you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep your plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking at the change in
temperature against in Fahrenheit from 50
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees to 113, tells you the relative
humidity you need to be at as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of gives you an idea of the ranges
here of where to keep your plants ideally
[SPEAKER_00]: happy and transpiring at an adequate rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a general summary of vapor pressure
deficit and key points is that it's mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: about transpiration, which is the movement
of that water through the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants transpire significantly less at
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use a night period for preventing disease
by keeping humidity and air temps
[SPEAKER_00]: typically lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to minimize VPD fluctuations for the
measurement that's used less than 0.4
[SPEAKER_00]: kilopascals.
[SPEAKER_00]: VPD still matters for respiration at
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daytime VPD is about 10 times more
important than nighttime VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to focus on one area,
focus on the daytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often VPD can increase yields as much as
CO2 enrichment can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't want to be restricting our
plants in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just another way to help maximize
that, looking at relative humidity and
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature to maximize our growing space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, summary, although VPD at night
is not nearly as important as your
[SPEAKER_00]: daytime, it's still an important factor to
consider for vigorous plant growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: increased yields and something that could
be holding you back even in your current
[SPEAKER_00]: setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about adjusting things,
adjusting the HVAC and consider
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidification when using LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, as a reminder, LED lights still
produce heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs just produce more light per watt than
an HPS setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get the same amount of light,
but it takes less heat to produce that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often this reduction in heat from the
lights, but with an increase in room
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, there can be less demand on
the HVAC system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can result in a compensation with a
dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the light fixtures may be a one-to-one
change from LED to HPS, but there may be
[SPEAKER_00]: more supplemental equipment such as a
dehumidifier that is needed to help
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain equal growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important consideration that
just because you're switching out one
[SPEAKER_00]: light for another, you may also need to
bring in another piece of equipment to
[SPEAKER_00]: help maintain that room environment from a
plant standpoint related to VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we're looking at our lights,
heat sinks are really critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to pull heat away from the
actual LED lights to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation of the diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heat sinks on the back of the fixture
further help this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of removing that heat that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rail design LEDs have less of an issue
compared to this compact form of LED style
[SPEAKER_00]: that allows for easier transition from HPS
style of lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, if you're looking at other
lights, you want to avoid ones that have
[SPEAKER_00]: fans because the fans tend to fail more
than the LED light structures and you
[SPEAKER_00]: could get to overheating that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a passive heat sink technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's really great at prolonging the life
of the LED lighting fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how we're looking at impacts of light
spectrum and intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the BPFD or Photosynthetic Photon Flux
Density is measured in micromoles per
[SPEAKER_00]: square meter per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the long unit which establishes
exactly how many PAR photons and that's in
[SPEAKER_00]: the photosynthetic spectrum are landing in
a specific area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to measure the, this is a measure
of light intensity taken at canopy level
[SPEAKER_00]: as the plant were growing as we can see
here time in days after transplant and LED
[SPEAKER_00]: lights are providing a more intense light
at the canopy level.
[SPEAKER_00]: This result can result in an increase in
potential yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at our comparison with
LED lights and the kind of the circles up
[SPEAKER_00]: here and then the HPS lights and the red
circles down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that there's a consistent
separation with a little bit more light
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity produced with the LED lights
compared to the HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at the room layout
essentially a one-to-one conversion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fixtures in the physical space of the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do a quick comparison of HPS and
LED light and they didn't average BPFD and
[SPEAKER_00]: uniformity compared to the two rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that the average BPFD and uniformity
are nearly the same when you compare the
[SPEAKER_00]: two with a slight edge to PPFD for LED
lights as well as uniformity but it is
[SPEAKER_00]: only slight.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to the previous graph this is
likely due to the natural degradation of
[SPEAKER_00]: the HPS bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got brand new HPS bulbs
compared to LEDs you might see a more
[SPEAKER_00]: similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're looking at the one just going
back for a second here looking at some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these these HPS lights could be a little
bit older and so you could be seeing more
[SPEAKER_00]: of a reduction in the light intensity
there compared to the information that was
[SPEAKER_00]: gathered here presented comparing these
two rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now light distribution so similar light
distribution of LED and HPS lights this
[SPEAKER_00]: helps them to be a one-to-one kind of
transition and we could see the HPS lights
[SPEAKER_00]: and the LED lights you know very similar
light spread pattern compared just a raw
[SPEAKER_00]: LED diode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's spreading of that light allows for
a more even distribution into the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of how does this look from a plant
standpoint?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well this is a nice kind of PPFD map.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at our HPS lights and our
LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That widespread optics of the LED with the
proper design layout allow for an even
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see that right here in the lower
LED ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: This offers a cross room look kind of
looking kind of sideways.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you that idea where that spread is
we could see that there is a slight
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit there to the LED lights creating
that more of that even spread across the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another advantage there to the LED
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now light spectrum comparisons LEDs do
have more blue than HPS's.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see this here this peak here is for
the LED light and we can see the HPS light
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the darker black shading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue light can induce stomata opening
which can increase the evapotrait or
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration and the humidity in the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of the reason why that
dehumidifier might be a needed component
[SPEAKER_00]: to your growing environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Differences may be slight and reduce
internode spacing with blue light
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is cultivar dependent and it can also
potentially increase cannabinoid levels as
[SPEAKER_00]: well but not necessarily to a great degree
because you're getting a mixed spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a blue light but there's
some research that does indicate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at our light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since LED's do emit less radiant heat than
HPS cultivators can increase the PPFD or
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of plant usable light measured
in photons to higher levels than
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended when using HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be especially advantageous when
carbon dioxide supplementation is being
[SPEAKER_00]: utilized in a grow room and we can see
that right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at running at 400 which is
ambient air to 800 to 1400.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much more light intensity the plants
can handle and there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations there and again investing
in a parameter would be advised there so
[SPEAKER_00]: you exactly know how much intensity of
light your plants are getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So data different changes to nutrient and
irrigation based on this transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to know what the baseline is
for your current system as is what you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be adjusting to basically match.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a common misconception that switching
from HPS to LED lights automatically
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger a need for increased nutrient and
irrigation levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under ideal conditions higher PPFDs levels
do generally lead to faster growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: lead to an increased need for nutrients
and water but it's best to know what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're currently using so use that as a
base of comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where your grow journals are very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: However nutrient needs increase because
growers do not adjust the other room
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters like ambient temperature,
VPD and dehumidification not strictly
[SPEAKER_00]: because of higher PPFD level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's other factors that can drive
that need for plants nutrients and water
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption to be changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this Gaveta did produce this kind of
LED cultivation set points as is just
[SPEAKER_00]: their recommendations I figured I include
that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at mother plants compared to
propagation of vegetative flower in a
[SPEAKER_00]: flush week with the photo period with the
light intensity the CO2 day and night the
[SPEAKER_00]: day and nighttime temperature as well as
relative humidity and leaching fractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a good baseline to see what your own
data is and just compare it to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again they offered it so I posted it here
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is there a true cost savings?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well this can be harder to determine as
there's often rebates which are great but
[SPEAKER_00]: often vary across the region and are not
always the same so it kind of offers a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a degree of variability if
you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fix your upfront cost and changes to the
HVAC system need to be taken into
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration in addition to the energy
consumption to run the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our HPS here's our LED and a
proper LED system you can see if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: some additional equipment that's added to
keep that growing room happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again that's something that needs the
growers need to be advised that switching
[SPEAKER_00]: up the lights is great but there may be
other environmental changes that they may
[SPEAKER_00]: not have those types of equipment if
they're currently running HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so here's what you've all been
waiting for my grower suggestions looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at all this data here's what I can offer
to you as growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to LED light lighting needs to be a
complete room commitment by the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Changing out failed HPS lights to LED
despite there being a one-to-one coverage
[SPEAKER_00]: area comparison is not advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to the different plant environmental
impacts currently HPS is overall a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more cost-effective option since you get
more than six HPS lights for the cost of a
[SPEAKER_00]: single LED light fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this cost difference can buy a lot of
electricity and bulbs so right now I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: sure if it's worth that one-to-one
comparison as you saw earlier that big
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar amount for the fixtures in addition
to potential room changes the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: may not be justifiable at least right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lighting going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So LED technology is a technology of the
future and is currently available but is
[SPEAKER_00]: cost prohibitive for many.
[SPEAKER_00]: As with any technology there will be
improvements and also reduce cost going
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example an improvement that could be
made could be those customizable plant
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrums and hopefully the research to
back it up as far as maximizing plant
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the cost of initial purchase drops
it'll make it an easier switch for growers
[SPEAKER_00]: to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you have seen it's more than just
simply changing out the fixtures which
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully a lot of growers are hoping to
be that easy but there is other factors to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may be worth the wait a little bit
longer if you currently have an HPS setup
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's working well for you might be
able to hold on to that setup for a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit longer be aware of the technology and
if you are making the change over to LED
[SPEAKER_00]: lights hopefully this video as well as
other research you do allows you make an
[SPEAKER_00]: informed decision so you can take one
successful operation and go right into
[SPEAKER_00]: another successful operation knowing what
you're getting into.
Thank you.
