[SPEAKER_00]: Now this can be a common problem with many
growers and that's the simple
[SPEAKER_00]: over-fertilizing of the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pouring on the fertilizer more and
more, a thing that's going to do benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: when actually it actually will result in
potentially more harm or negatively
[SPEAKER_00]: impacting the end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a common occurrence with
growers because they want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: they get the most out of their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they figured, well, a little more
fertilizer, it's not going to cost me that
[SPEAKER_00]: much more, but I want to ensure I get the
best yield that I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's important for these growers
to remember that over-fertilizing can not
[SPEAKER_00]: only hurt yields, potentially get into
toxicity range, but can waste money and
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially contaminate groundwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep an idea of sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep our rivers and waterways as
clean as possible without contaminating
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also don't want to waste money
unnecessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are both ways that
over-fertilizing can negatively impact the
[SPEAKER_00]: grower and also the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Signs of over-fertilization can be brittle
leaves, burn leaf margins, and buds that
[SPEAKER_00]: smell like fertilizer, buds that make
noise when they're burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just ways to be able to tell if
you've over-fertilized a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, many of these kind of wait until
the end result, so it's important to be
[SPEAKER_00]: mindful of that throughout the process to
be testing leaves to make sure they do
[SPEAKER_00]: have some flexibility to them in watching
the margins for potential
[SPEAKER_00]: over-fertilization burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also want to be careful of other things
that can cause the leaf margins to burn,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as being too close to the lights or
deficiencies even in some instances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just follow recommendations,
err on the side of caution, and always add
[SPEAKER_00]: more fertilizer, and it's harder than it
is to take it away once you've over-added
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be mindful so that you're growing a
crop in a sustainable manner, not wasting
[SPEAKER_00]: money, and not potentially contaminating
the environment.
Thank you for watching, and have a great
week.
