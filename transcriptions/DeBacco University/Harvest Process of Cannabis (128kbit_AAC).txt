[SPEAKER_01]: In this DeBaco University video,
we're going to go over the harvest process
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give you some options,
such as whole plant or selective,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as an indoor and an outdoor
environment example, so you can try to
[SPEAKER_01]: apply this process and be thinking about
your chosen path when you go to
[SPEAKER_01]: considering harvesting cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's get into the harvest
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember those real world examples we
provided at the end here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first off, even before you get into
harvest, while many growers focus on the
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest process, remember that before you
begin the process of harvesting,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should have the next step all set to
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that next step, a very important
drying and curing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you have that set up before you
start taking any plants down.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no sense harvesting if you're not
ready to move the material through the
[SPEAKER_01]: final phases of the process, simply
because you have a greater chance of
[SPEAKER_01]: losing that crop and material there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you determine when to harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: When's the best time to harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this comes from an inspection of the
buds themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: A combination of stigma and trichome
development is used to pinpoint the peak
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest times.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to see some representative
images of both the stigma, the trichome,
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the bud size and development,
there are other videos on this channel
[SPEAKER_01]: that can help you with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In short, though, when the stigmas are a
tan brown coloration and the trichomes are
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly cloudy with a few starting to turn
amber color, this is typically a sign that
[SPEAKER_01]: the harvest time is basically,
quote unquote, now.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're kind of seeing that age of
development, that's kind of that peak
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to have everything set up for
the drying and curing phase ahead of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you get to this, you can go
through with the harvest process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So preparing the plants, preparing the
growers as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you determine that the plants are
close to harvest time, be sure to allow
[SPEAKER_01]: some time to flush them when you're only
giving them water and not nutrients to
[SPEAKER_01]: remove any excess buildups of nutrients or
salts in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, by just giving them water,
you're reducing your input cost without
[SPEAKER_01]: impacting your yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: For more information on that, again,
other videos, keep in mind that this is
[SPEAKER_01]: applied to both indoor and outdoor
operations as well as hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hydroponics, you're going to have the
shortest duration of flush time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for soil with a higher clay base,
you're going to have the longest duration
[SPEAKER_01]: of time for flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to have more than just the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be sure you have the following on hand to
make the harvest processing as efficient
[SPEAKER_01]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have pruners, a transport
surface, as well as time and labor to go
[SPEAKER_01]: through the actual process of taking down
the plants, harvesting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there will be other videos on wet
trims and dry trims that you can look at
[SPEAKER_01]: in this channel as far as doing the final
detailed trim as we see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just taking the plants down can be
quite labor intensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those pruners that I had mentioned when
we're talking pruners or when I mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: pruners, I'm talking something more like
the image here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're used for cutting back branches and
are different from scissors that are used
[SPEAKER_01]: more for detail work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I consider these to be scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are more your pruners.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're typically the rough and tough
plant takedown tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're especially useful for removing the
central stem on that ground level.
[SPEAKER_01]: On smaller plants and larger plants,
you're kind of cutting that plant down
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're going to use pruners for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your scissors, I consider to be more your
detailed trimmers, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that transport surface that I had
mentioned, since you're likely to have the
[SPEAKER_01]: growing location separate from the drying
location, a method of moving the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to be implemented.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on the size of the harvest and
distance, this can involve a trailer or
[SPEAKER_01]: even a cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: In either situation, the goal is to have a
clean surface and to not overly pack the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants during transport to avoid
physically damaging the plants during this
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some go with like cattle trailers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll actually hang plants right in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others will go with selective bins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these are different options.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the key part or consistency with all
these is clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have to wash them out between
transport and not really kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: packing them in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're kind of loosely putting them here
or even hanging them are both good
[SPEAKER_01]: options.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned, the time and labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having an idea of the scale of your
operation, which we'll see in some videos
[SPEAKER_01]: here showing indoor and outdoor,
scale of the operation is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants you determine to be ready for
harvest, make sure you have enough time
[SPEAKER_01]: and helping hands to get the job done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often this is a labor intensive process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be sure to pace your progress and keep
an eye on everyone for both typically to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that plants are being harvested
the way you want, but also just a good
[SPEAKER_01]: practice to keep an eye on everyone that's
working for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure no one gets lost or dehydrated
or heat stroke or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, keep that in mind as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've got two ways we can harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, we have the whole plant
harvest and then we also have selective
[SPEAKER_01]: plant harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, whole plant harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: The advantage is allows for clearing of an
entire plant material all at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time, which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes for easy planning and clearing of
the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the planned end product is
concentrated, you're taking all the buds,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the plants at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The disadvantage is it's the most labor
intensive of the harvesting options and
[SPEAKER_01]: all the plant material has to be handled
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be very difficult to
kind of hang and dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Entire plants, but as we can see in this
image, it is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other option, if it doesn't sound like
it fits your operation, we have also going
[SPEAKER_01]: on to selective plant harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this allows growers to select only the
buds at their prime.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can provide the opportunity for other
buds to continue to develop and ideally
[SPEAKER_01]: get more yield in the same area.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the disadvantage does require
multiple times to go through the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and harvest and time and care needed to be
taken to carefully remove only those buds
[SPEAKER_01]: that are at the peak of harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you've learned about these methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have an idea about the kind of harvest
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm going to go into both an outdoor
and an indoor operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get an idea of applying what
method you might choose to these actual
[SPEAKER_01]: real world situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now keep in mind this is field grown,
so you are going to have some natural
[SPEAKER_01]: variability, especially growing this many
plants with the variable of the weather
[SPEAKER_01]: and reaction to maybe the transplant of
going into containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But overall, we can see that there's
definitely this great kind of transition
[SPEAKER_01]: from the vegetative stage right to the
flower stage and now getting to late
[SPEAKER_01]: flower stage, which will soon progress to
the harvest stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will lead to the drying and
curing stage as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a nice kind of view here of
just kind of the end of the season harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll look some of these buds a little
bit closer up here so you can get that
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciation for exactly what all these
plants have gone through and are
[SPEAKER_01]: producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now here we are out in the field
looking at the development of the buds and
[SPEAKER_01]: assessing how far along they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can see looking at some of the
leaves near the buds, we're seeing that
[SPEAKER_01]: coloration, that amber kind of change to
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also going to be getting into
looking at the actual bud themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're seeing a full kind of
development here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're noticing, we're going to get a
little closer view here of the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: stigmas to see how they're actually
looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're developing quite long.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing a lot of that brown
coloration indicating they're kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: nearing that end of development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we don't want to always compare it to
what's around us because it can depend on
[SPEAKER_01]: the planting time of the actual crop,
depending a little bit on the weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: But looking behind me, we see the leaves
turning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a sign that we're having that
reduction in light, that change in photo
[SPEAKER_01]: period, and that's signaling these plants
to go through and develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here as we're taking a real specific
look at this bud in particular,
[SPEAKER_01]: we definitely see some of the development
that is occurring and the degree of
[SPEAKER_01]: development that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now those leaves, definitely getting some
of that little purple coloration to them,
[SPEAKER_01]: indicating we are getting to the colder
times of the year, indicating hopefully
[SPEAKER_01]: also those anthocyanins might be as just a
stress response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some varieties will produce more of
that purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, what we're really looking at is
kind of the stigma and hopefully
[SPEAKER_01]: development of trichomes with the loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're noticing here that we're getting
that kind of brown coloration to the very
[SPEAKER_01]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a sign that we're getting near that
end of development, indicating that this
[SPEAKER_01]: bud's going to be ready to harvest pretty
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another bud on the same plant,
also inspecting this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the apical marasum, this is one of the
side branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can see continued and consistent
development, which is great to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Realizing that this may not get to the
full development that we saw the first
[SPEAKER_01]: one, but definitely seeing very consistent
colorations, very consistent stigma
[SPEAKER_01]: development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it may not reach the full size
as the apical marasum, but definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: progressing along the same progression
that we saw the apical marasum,
[SPEAKER_01]: indicating this plant might be harvested
all around the same time, which makes it
[SPEAKER_01]: great from a grower standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to go through and harvest
all the individual buds at separate
[SPEAKER_01]: timetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is that little zoom out here,
looking at the whole plant, and the many
[SPEAKER_01]: located behind this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall here, you can see in total in
this grow space, it's about 6,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's harvest time, which is a busy
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you can be a victim of your
own success.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just keep going through, keep
harvesting, and hopefully you'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: rewarded in the end with a very successful
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's plenty of work to do here that
we can see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we're going through the greenhouse
here, we can see all of the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: see kind of this greenhouse environment,
have some fans on for air circulation,
[SPEAKER_01]: try to prune those lower leaves out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we are getting close to the harvest
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are seeing the buds developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we see the upper portions being
where the light is exposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, that's where most of the
prime or apical buds are positioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: See some lights there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those lights are there for early stage
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's cloudy out, offers a little
supplemental light.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main light source for these plants is,
of course, the sun, which makes this
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse environment very energy
efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there is some heat and cooling,
of course, and some lights, as you can
[SPEAKER_01]: see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, the sun is the
energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now utilizing that sun, we see the screen
of green method here, where all those buds
[SPEAKER_01]: have kind of been pruned and kind of
directed to go through that mesh material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that mesh material allows them to
support themselves, allows a great way to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to support all those plant
materials to try to maintain those apical
[SPEAKER_01]: buds so they get the maximum amount of
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we saw earlier the lower
portions being pruned out with the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are about 6,000 plants here,
so quite a lot to take care of getting
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a lot of work to come with the
harvest process of all of these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
Thank you.
