[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to investigate natural
killer cells or NK cells and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: relate to the human immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you right now they are very
appropriately named related to the
[SPEAKER_00]: function that they perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now natural killer cells, they go through
and they're looking for infected cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see here in the first case,
our natural killer cells recognize an MHC
[SPEAKER_00]: class 1, major histone complementary
complex here, and it doesn't kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's able to recognize these surface
proteins as self and a healthy cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, our natural killer cell does
not destroy that cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because it's recognized as self or
host.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's displaying the right identifying
proteins on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in this case, in the below here,
we have an infected cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice the proteins recognitions are
not being expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, our natural killer cell will
go about lysing that cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind to lyse means to kill or
destroy or break up that cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because this one is infected with a
virus, it's not displaying the proper
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition proteins on the outside,
and the natural killer cell will go
[SPEAKER_00]: through the process of destroying that
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important that our natural killer
cells don't go around destroying every
[SPEAKER_00]: cell, only the ones that are infected or
need to be eliminated, and those are
[SPEAKER_00]: determined by not displaying the proper
coat proteins on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, natural killer cells can lyse and
kill cancer cells and virus-infected
[SPEAKER_00]: cells, making them a very important
component of the immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the most aggressive of the immune
cells, and they're the only phagocyte that
[SPEAKER_00]: destroys other human cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: They react nonspecifically and eliminate
cancerous and virus-infected cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kill their target cells by releasing
these toxins and proteins here,
[SPEAKER_00]: foreign proteins and other cytolytic
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They secrete these potent chemicals that
enhance the inflammatory response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while these might sound like a bad
thing, initially that creating
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation, in certain instances,
particularly sites of injury, they are
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, they go through,
and they are able to go through the body
[SPEAKER_00]: and kill target cells through this
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this has given you a little bit
more background on exactly what natural
[SPEAKER_00]: killer cells do and how they're able to
recognize healthy cells from one that is
infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: and virus-infected.
