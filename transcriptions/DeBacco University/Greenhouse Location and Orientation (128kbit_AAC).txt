[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, when looking at a greenhouse,
because it's a permanent structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: we should be very concerned with the
location and the orientation of that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular structure, because it's going
to be fixed in place and we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize plant productivity within that
particular grow area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's important to make the distinction
between greenhouses and high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouses are permanent structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They typically have heat and electricity
and a permanent floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally speaking, compared to high
tunnels, they are more expensive and they
[SPEAKER_00]: can cover larger areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: High tunnels are the basic structures or
basically poly here on hoops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are grown right in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, they're less expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really allow for a full
calendar year production, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: colder climates, and typically cover 4,000
square feet or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, focusing again on the greenhouse
production, these are permanent locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as a result, growers have control over
many of the climactic conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also provide consistency and a fixed
plant moving and support structures here
[SPEAKER_00]: because they are solid, fixed structures
that allows growers to plan accordingly to
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're well-suited for full year
production and they can have supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting added also to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is a cloudy day and you can see,
you know, a little hard to see,
[SPEAKER_00]: not a lot of sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some supplemental lights on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air circulation also is important,
so that's helping us maintain our plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in the right photo period and also
receiving sufficient light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, those permanent locations allow for
adequate planning and running here of
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation lines, of heating lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see supplemental lighting in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, location of the greenhouses should be
an area that gets maximum sunlight
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure for the entire year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large flat areas that have easy access to
water and electricity to run to them is
[SPEAKER_00]: advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it might be, you know, an ideal
location right in the middle of a field
[SPEAKER_00]: here, but we can't run water, electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to present an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to consider also ease of access
by vehicles to transport material to and
[SPEAKER_00]: from the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be potting media, that could be
end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have it in the middle of
nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to kind of pick a good location
and consider all of these particular
[SPEAKER_00]: factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the orientation of the greenhouse
should be based on the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to match up with the main
productive cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: For fall and winter or spring production,
it's advised to orient the greenhouse in
[SPEAKER_00]: an east to west to help capture a lower
sun angle effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a north to south orientation is
advised to maximize light penetration and
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit ventilation also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the orientation may not be 100% chosen
because there's constraints of certain
[SPEAKER_00]: areas, but depending on when you want to
run your main production cycle may
[SPEAKER_00]: influence the exact orientation of the
north, south, east, west direction you
[SPEAKER_00]: choose to run your greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
