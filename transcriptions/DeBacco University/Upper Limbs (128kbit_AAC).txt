[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to be looking at
the upper limbs of the body and provide
[SPEAKER_00]: you some information and some comparisons
between those bones in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, those upper limb region,
what do they consist of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they consist of about 30 bones in
three regions, your arm or shoulder to
[SPEAKER_00]: elbow, your forearm, your ulna and your
radius, and your wrist and your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The upper limbs consist of the humerus,
which is that upper arm portion here,
[SPEAKER_00]: radius and ulna on the forearm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have eight bones inside your carpals,
five bones in your metacarpals,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 14 bones in your phalanges.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see them listed here in
this image as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have the humerus, which is a bone
of the upper arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking right in this region here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It runs from the shoulder to the elbow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Approximately, it articulates with the
scapula from the shoulder joint,
[SPEAKER_00]: and distally articulates with the radius
and ulna at the elbow joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can again see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's highlighted in red in this image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking specifically at the forearm
contains those two bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking over here, the ulna and the
radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people confuse these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully I'll be able to provide some
clarification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the radius and ulna extend parallel
from the elbow where they articulate with
[SPEAKER_00]: the humerus and the wrist.
[SPEAKER_00]: The humerus and the wrist.
[SPEAKER_00]: The radius is larger than the ulna.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of like your big take home
message of the radius being larger than
[SPEAKER_00]: the ulna.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's to try to put it here in bold
and small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see them listed right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initial might be a little hard to tell,
but I think here you can kind of see
[SPEAKER_00]: radius compared to the ulna.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anatomically, the radius is located
laterally to the ulna, placing it near the
[SPEAKER_00]: thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the radius, if you're looking at your
hand, radius would be located near your
[SPEAKER_00]: thumb, and the ulna would be on the other
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anatomically, the ulna is located
medially to the radius, placing it near
[SPEAKER_00]: the little finger again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your radius would be closer to your
thumb, and your ulna would be located
[SPEAKER_00]: closer to your pinky finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now looking at pronation and
supination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pronation and the forearm is the
rotational movement where the hand and
[SPEAKER_00]: upper arm are turned inwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're looking here, because if you
feel, if you hold your hand here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can feel that a bone is moving,
and that is basically the radius rolling
[SPEAKER_00]: over the ulna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supination is the forearm occurring when
the forearm and palm are rotated outwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of like exposing the palm when
both bones are essentially parallel to one
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's considered to be the standard
position.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've ever seen an image of anyone,
their palms are usually facing out because
[SPEAKER_00]: that keeps the bones parallel,
and that's considered the standard position.
