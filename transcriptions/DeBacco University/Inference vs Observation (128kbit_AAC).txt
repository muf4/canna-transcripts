[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at
comparing an inference and observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think they're interchangeable
terms, they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to learn what defines each.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to come back to this image in
a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make some inferences and
some observations based on this image.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting first, you should probably
explain what each is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, an observation is limited to a
description of actions or events without
[SPEAKER_00]: interpretation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part there is without
interpretation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, an inference is a
conclusion we draw based on what we
[SPEAKER_00]: observe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may be asking something an
inference or an observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that quick kind of also comparison
between the two, looking at an inference
[SPEAKER_00]: to start with, it's a conclusion reached
as based on evidence and reasoning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It involves a mental process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a logical interpretation of
observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be based on secondhand experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what an inference really comes down is
it's what you think about from an
[SPEAKER_00]: observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that observation is that description
without interpretation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It involves paying close attention and
gaining information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can use the five senses that aids in
the ability to generate an inference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be experienced firsthand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things you can kind of see and observe.
[SPEAKER_00]: No interpretation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go back to that first image and
make some inferences and some
[SPEAKER_00]: observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at this here, observation,
we see a woman getting splashed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now an inference would be it's a hot day
and she's getting splashed with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't know if this is just regular
water, if this is lemon water,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is ice water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are only inferring something there
again based on the observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, she's wearing glasses, getting
splashed in the face here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how we can infer a lot and
have very limited observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go through a couple more
examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's again our definitions between
observations and inference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see some footprints here in the
sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: One observation would be the footprints in
the sand have five toes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something we can count, something we can
observe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The footprints are about 25 centimeters
long to measure that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The space between each pair of footprints
is about 60 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are three observations for this
image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inferences, three inferences for this
image are an animal made these footprints,
[SPEAKER_00]: say a human made these footprints,
and the human was walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're inferring that because we're not
sure if it was walking, could be running,
[SPEAKER_00]: but based on the spacing we're going to
infer that this individual was walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go through our last example here,
observations and inferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want you to pause the video now and
make some observations and some inferences
[SPEAKER_00]: for this particular image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you paused the video there,
made some observations and inferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want you to do that same process
again with a little bit more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what observations and inferences can
you make from this position number two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're done pausing the video
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to do this one last time,
one third time here for position three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make some observations and some
inferences for position three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could see how as we gain more
information, we're able to make a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more precise inferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe and also be very careful on making
pure observations that aren't a mental
[SPEAKER_00]: process or aren't influenced by maybe
aren't opinions or biases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, last image here, taking the look
here, the ferry here located between Rocky
[SPEAKER_00]: Hill and Glastonbury, Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you just to observe this and I've
got a couple of questions on the next
[SPEAKER_00]: slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take about pause the video here,
take about 30 seconds to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: everything in and around the ferry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scenery in the background,
the foreground, what's on the ferry and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how good your observation skills
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you've taken a pause there,
see if you can answer these questions
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many vehicles are on the ferry?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the color of the van on the ferry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any other boats in the image?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the name of the barge?
[SPEAKER_00]: What direction was the ferry traveling and
how many people do you see on the ferry?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go back and compare and take a
look and see if you can compare your
[SPEAKER_00]: answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the last slide being the answers
and you're welcome to then go through and
[SPEAKER_00]: compare your answers to the ones I
provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're very good at making
observations and making inferences and
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to distinguish the difference
between the two.
Thank you.
