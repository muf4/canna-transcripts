[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a very brief overview
of the artificial lighting options and we
[SPEAKER_00]: see a bunch of them here in this bedroom
and just identifying which ones that they
[SPEAKER_00]: are and what their main purpose is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the types of lighting options are the
best uses here provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no in the picture here
fluorescence, but T5s are high energy
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient and they're typically used for
clones or seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: For HID, the high intensity output lights,
metal halide lights are typically used for
[SPEAKER_00]: veg, the veg phase even though they're not
pictured here.
[SPEAKER_00]: CMHs or ceramic metal halides are
propagation into veg and this is one
[SPEAKER_00]: example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a CMH light.
[SPEAKER_00]: High pressure sodium is used for flowering
and it has that kind of yellowish tint to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEP or light emitting plasma is veg or
used as flower supplementation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also produces a very white, almost
slightly bluish light here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then LEDs can be or light emitting
diodes and this can be for the full grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's not necessarily a full
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of purple and pink light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some that will produce a very
clean white light and those are used for
[SPEAKER_00]: full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just this gives you that quick little
comparison of how these different lights
[SPEAKER_00]: look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the different colors that they can
produce and how you can easily identify
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One potentially by their structure or two
by the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that we perceive that light to
produce.
Thank you for watching.
