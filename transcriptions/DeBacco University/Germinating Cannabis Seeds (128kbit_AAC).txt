[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go through the
process of properly germinating a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you can take a seed and turn
it into a nice healthy-looking seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: like the one pictured here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is germination?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's first define that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the development of a plant from a
dormant seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the same as emergence,
which is when the sprout actually breaks
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seeds can germinate but not emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an important note here,
these are germinating seeds, is that when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at the germination
percentage that's usually provided by
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, it's only the percentage that
actually produced, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: a small root.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not mean that they emerged from
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So germination rate will always be higher
than emergence rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how deep to plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important so that you have the
increased odds of emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to plant your seeds too
deep because the seeds will run out of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy reserves before it can emerge and
start utilizing light energy for the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically you want to plant seeds only
about an eighth to a quarter inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three mils to six mils deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rule of thumb is to plant the seed twice
as deep as the width.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an eighth inch seed should be planted
about a quarter inches deep here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this image here, again, it's just
shown planting the soil, this would be
[SPEAKER_00]: much too deep for cannabis seeds because
they'll run out of energy before they can
[SPEAKER_00]: emerge out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's a germination process require?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it requires a seed that has quality
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should be a quality seed on top of
the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need seeds that have these kind of
dark color coloration and are full.
[SPEAKER_00]: These typically come from a known source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's helpful for increase the odds of
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what defines a quality seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can see very consistent
conditions here, but the presence of
[SPEAKER_00]: stored nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even these full seeds here have a
limited amount of energy stored in their
[SPEAKER_00]: endosperm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what gives the seeds the energy to
emerge out of the soil before they shed
[SPEAKER_00]: that seed coat and are able to capture
light energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If planted at the proper depth,
energy reserves will allow the emergence
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, a quality seed, nice consistent
conditions we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, seeds only need water, heat,
and air to germinate, which sounds really
[SPEAKER_00]: easy, but having the right amount and
ratio of those is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: For water, soaking seeds can speed up
water infiltration, but this is not
[SPEAKER_00]: required.
[SPEAKER_00]: When water does enter the seeds,
it will cause hormones, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: cubarellans, to activate and produce this
radical.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the radical pops, this is the first
sign that germination has started.
[SPEAKER_00]: For temperature, more temperature is not
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to maintain about 78 to 82
degrees Fahrenheit to increase the odds of
[SPEAKER_00]: successful germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: If temperatures reach 90 degrees and
greater, this can kill the seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent germination from occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: This essentially roasts the seeds and
denature vital proteins, preventing this
[SPEAKER_00]: radical formation of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air, seeds do need to breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They especially need oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over soaking them will really suffocate
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: See an example of the scuba diver here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds need to breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to have that kind of air
exchange that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just soak them in water and kind of
drown them, you're not going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange important oxygen for the process
of respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advice, if you are going to seed soak,
providing time for seeds to soak in water
[SPEAKER_00]: can help increase germination rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purified distilled RO, which is reverse
osmosis, or quality tap water can all be
[SPEAKER_00]: used.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no one preferred source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers may even put some seaweed or
kelp to help the process along,
[SPEAKER_00]: but again, this is not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soaking the seeds no more than 12 to 18
hours is recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you soak in the bath for too long,
your fingers will get pruney.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to drown the seeds and over
saturate the water inside them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may notice if you do soak your seeds,
some may sink over time, which indicates a
[SPEAKER_00]: fully developed seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're denser, they're heavier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that float typically are hollow and
have poor endosperm development.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result is typically reduced
germination rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scarification is weakening the seed coat,
which increases water infiltration to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve germination rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: By carefully sanding the outer surface of
the seed coat can allow for easier water
[SPEAKER_00]: print penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're essentially taking away that solid
texture and just a little sandpaper
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing water to get inside the seed a
little bit more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you do over sand them,
you can damage the delicate embryo inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sanding could cause a delay in
water infiltration, which could reduce or
[SPEAKER_00]: increase germination time.
[SPEAKER_00]: With scarified seeds, soaking time can
often be reduced or may not even be needed
[SPEAKER_00]: in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can direct seed, and this is a
preferred method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture initiates the germination
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're planting them, you're
saturating the media ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should provide adequate moisture
levels to initiate the germination
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over saturating the media will suffocate
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need for additional hormones or
even kelp to aid in this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distilled water is advised for consistency
and lack of additives.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part here is having everything
prepared ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see even the corner, the middle,
and the side cells here are all evened
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's important to allow even
germination process and not having wet,
[SPEAKER_00]: overly wet or dry spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers have heard this paper towel
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a discouraged method for cannabis
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a process that involves starting
seeds in moistened paper towel prior to
[SPEAKER_00]: adding to media.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows you to see the radical
produced and transplant seeds that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know have germinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers think it's the advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while that is true, this process is
discouraged because increase of odds of
[SPEAKER_00]: damage to that very newly formed radical.
[SPEAKER_00]: This method is best suited for plants that
have large seeds, produce large roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis does not fall into that category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some believe that you can increase the
percentage of female plants by adjusting
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in white.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of these have supporting science
since gender is determined by genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some say increasing nitrogen and humidity,
lower K levels during the first two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: will make plants turn female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ensuring plants receive more blue than red
light for about 14 to 16 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not going to influence male or female
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And reduce plant stress to increase the
chance of producing female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, false statement there and not going
to influence whether that seedling is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be male or female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radical production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in about three to eight days,
the seeds will produce a radical
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating the germination process has
been initiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much as you may want to see this happen,
the best place is for this to happen
[SPEAKER_00]: directly in the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be transferring these seeds to
see how small some of these radicals are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The odds of damage are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: During that transfer process may lead to
damaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you break this radical, it may stunt or
even kill your new prospective plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember roots do not like sunlight or be
disturbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's best to just put them in
the media and let them be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That media that you're using is hopefully
a propagation or germination mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a finer mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a finer kind of substrate here and
allows for better soil moisture contact
[SPEAKER_00]: with the small seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less air pockets will develop causing more
consistent conditions for your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A growing media is coarser and may result
in potentially dry pockets and reduce your
[SPEAKER_00]: germination rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the germination process,
use a germination or a propagation mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radical can also be used for germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's tubes that can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially inert material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can allow for seedlings to be directly
planted into larger containers with
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal root disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some companies that make a small
area that you put your seed in and larger
[SPEAKER_00]: blocks that easily can accept the smaller
blocks there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless of your chosen media,
it's important to pre-soak the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have it ready before you soak your
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get everything ready and then start the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it the other way around in case
you're missing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start those seeds in water,
the germination process ideally will be initiated.
