[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, in this Tobacco University video,
we're investigating two scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: articles that will help us address the
topic of determining the chemical profile
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis via HPLC and HRMS methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll learn about what each of those is in
more detail here in this video lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the first reference
article here, again, with any reference
[SPEAKER_00]: article, I try to give you that first
page, the proper citation, and a direct
[SPEAKER_00]: link there so you can go investigate it
further if you want to look at some more
[SPEAKER_00]: of the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at cannabis variability,
and that's kind of where these methods are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at kind of trying to assess that,
the variability within cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis strains significantly vary in
their chemical compositions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concentration of cannabis' compounds
depend on the plant's tissue type,
[SPEAKER_00]: the age, the variety, the growing
conditions, such as nutrition they're fed,
[SPEAKER_00]: the humidity and light levels,
harvest time, storage conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as many other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Analyzing the chemical content,
the plants is of major importance
[SPEAKER_00]: considering that the concentrations of
these constituents and their interplay may
[SPEAKER_00]: determine medical effects and also
potentially adverse side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting a good idea of what the actual
compounds are present is well worthwhile,
[SPEAKER_00]: so what methods we go through to evaluate
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have two presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the gas chromatography,
or abbreviated GC, and HPLC, which stands
[SPEAKER_00]: for High Performance Liquid
Chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: So HPLC resolves the threat of the
phyto-cannabinoid decomposition as a
[SPEAKER_00]: result of the heating compared with gas
chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see kind of a great little quick
comparison here.
[SPEAKER_00]: HPLC can be directly applied for fractions
of extracts and to separate pure compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: unlike the gas chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fractions of extracts are of high
importance in medical research and for
[SPEAKER_00]: structure classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why typically when we're
comparing the two, overall the HPLC is
[SPEAKER_00]: typically favored over the more
traditional gas chromatography,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly, or especially, in related to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on to another research article,
if you want to look at some more
[SPEAKER_00]: information, again, same reference link
and copy of the first page here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to look at this one in more
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where we're looking at the
kind of the comparison of extracted ion
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatograms here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see is these kind of like
chemical signatures where liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatography methods coupled to high
resolution mass spec detection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where we get the HPLC HRMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: That high resolution mass spec is what
HRMS is standing for.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have been developed for the
identification of different cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis medical extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The HMRS technique can define the
cannabinoid profile of cannabis end
[SPEAKER_00]: products, which is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Current focus is on the main cannabinoids
such as CBD and THC, along with some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other, quote, minor cannabinoids,
which contribute to the final beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having these or knowing these,
a very precise measurement here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see looking at some of the
differences presented in that research
[SPEAKER_00]: study that I cited before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a great way to develop this
kind of detailed understanding of what is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually in that cannabis plant,
what it actually has produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the macro to the microscopic views,
as we kind of can see in the example here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf of a typical cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we zoom in, say the leaf of a typical
cannabis plant, then we have that zoom in
[SPEAKER_00]: version here with the magnifying leaf
showing the individual trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the surface swab of that leaf
conducting right here in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the mass spec of that sample
collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of the general process of
how we go about sampling that plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: developing those very particular mass spec
graphs there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be the process that would be
utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, actually taking direct
samples from the plant and getting an
[SPEAKER_00]: exact kind of profile, which is great when
we're looking at trying to evaluate what
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, particularly cannabis plants,
may or may not be producing.
