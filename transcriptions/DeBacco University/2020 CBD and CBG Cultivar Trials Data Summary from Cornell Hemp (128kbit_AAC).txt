[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video,
where we'll be investigating the 2020 CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: and CBG cultivar trial data summary from
Cornell Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this provides some great data,
and I'm going to go through here,
[SPEAKER_00]: share it with you, and break it down a
little bit so you can better understand
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, looking at the CBD
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: While they chose a large sample set,
we're looking at 41 cultivars used in this
[SPEAKER_00]: study, as can be seen in this list here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are like, well,
what CBD cultivars are there?
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be a good starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's additional information more
than just a list of cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also look and see the propagation,
whether it was from seed, whether that
[SPEAKER_00]: seed was dioecious, meaning expecting 50%
male and 50% female, or whether that seed
[SPEAKER_00]: was feminized, where we'd expect it above
that, ideally above 90%, 95% female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if it was from seed versus a clone,
the germination rate is provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for germination rate, we can see some
are very high germination rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: some much lower here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one here looking at only 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a good time to kind of go through,
pause and take a look, pause the video,
[SPEAKER_00]: take a look at some of the cultivars,
the propagation, the sources, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: sites that they were grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just, again, gives you some more
information to make a wise decision when
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while these are 41 CBD cultivars,
we also have a list here of CBG cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of growers are kind of
interested in this cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then are curious, what are some
cultivars that fit in this category?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the propagation material?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And where's the source for there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see them all listed out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can, again, provide a good
starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just want to see how these cultivars
perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this study specifically was looking at
the flower timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be the main focus here,
is looking at the timing of flower for
[SPEAKER_00]: these different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 23 of the 52 cultivars in the 2020 CBD
CBG trial have initiated terminal
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering before 8-17-20.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is August 17th, the year 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each dot on this graph here indicates the
date an individual plant was marked as
[SPEAKER_00]: terminal flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Violent outlines show the distribution of
points for each cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Percents indicate the percent of cultivar
that had flower by August 17th,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that listed right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning some were literally 100% into
flower by this date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some only 25% into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an important consideration when
we're looking at kind of outdoor growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: at timing of that flowering there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how necessarily, it's not always
they're all going to flower at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different cultivars are going to flower at
different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can impact when someone may
choose to plant them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can impact when we're looking at
harvesting, when to maximize that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to minimize the investment and
maximize the return.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is just good information
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, rather than highlight each
individual cultivar, go through,
[SPEAKER_00]: pause the video, take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is some great information to
growers when you're looking at making that
[SPEAKER_00]: selection of cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also maybe here, knowing what the
cultivars might exist that you may have
[SPEAKER_00]: not been initially familiar with.
