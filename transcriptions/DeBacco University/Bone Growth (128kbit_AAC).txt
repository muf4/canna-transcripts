[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to attempt to simplify the
process of bone growth and remodeling and
[SPEAKER_00]: see how this interrelates with the process
of our growing skeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with bone growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bones are remodeled and lengthened until
growth stops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bones change shape a little bit depending
on the conditions that they may face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bones also need to grow in width as we
progress from the embryo to the fetus to a
[SPEAKER_00]: child to ultimately the adult stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see at the embryonic stage we have a
high amount of cartilage present within
[SPEAKER_00]: the quote bones and over time we see an
increase in the replacing of that
[SPEAKER_00]: cartilage with more of this ossification
region in this newly forming bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this newly forming bone is occurring
and helping the length of the bone and
[SPEAKER_00]: also the width of the bone to help support
the increased weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cartilage will still be left even in
adults at the very ends basically the head
[SPEAKER_00]: regions of the bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a bone needs to articulate with
another bone to create a smooth surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this ossification process this is the
formation of bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this high amount of cartilage and
slowly being replaced with this spongy
[SPEAKER_00]: bone here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This diaphysis region remember that's the
long portion of the long bone and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what's increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember this contains our marrow because
we're talking a very young individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: We contain a lot of red bone marrow and as
we age that red bone marrow will slowly be
[SPEAKER_00]: replaced with yellow bone marrow to
suppose mostly a fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: An adult we're considering at the age of
25 because nearly all the bones are
[SPEAKER_00]: completely ossified in humans by the age
of 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now bone growth looking specifically at an
x-ray here of a 12 year old child showing
[SPEAKER_00]: the growth plates and these plates these
growth plates these epiphyseal plates are
[SPEAKER_00]: the regions that are actually growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new cartilage is continuously formed
older cartilage becomes ossified remember
[SPEAKER_00]: that ossification process is basically
forming that cartilage into bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cartilage is broken down and bone replaces
that cartilage over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a femur again this is our thigh
bone one of our longest of long long bones
[SPEAKER_00]: there and the mature long bone see in
comparison to that growing long bone we
[SPEAKER_00]: see the diaphysis reaching its full length
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other regions are maintaining very
similar shapes maybe increasing in width
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the age spread of this
individual but the key part here is that
[SPEAKER_00]: diaphysis is increasing in length.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now long bone growth and remodeling well
growth in length the cartilage continually
[SPEAKER_00]: grows and is replaced by bone as shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have cartilage growing right here
here and here the cartilage is replaced by
[SPEAKER_00]: bone at this distinctive line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cartilage grows in this region here
and the cartilage is replaced by bone in
[SPEAKER_00]: this more central portion of the long bone
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this growth occurs in length because
we're replacing this cartilage through the
[SPEAKER_00]: ossification process with bone causing
that bone to grow in its length.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is remodeling then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well remodeling is growing shaft is
remodeled in relation to conditions or
[SPEAKER_00]: stresses that this bone may be under.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our bone being reabsorbed in
this region bone is added by the
[SPEAKER_00]: oppositional growth here and bone is being
reabsorbed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're remodeling we're slightly changing
the shape of the bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this remodeling is actually can be
regulated under two different control
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: One could be hormonal which maintains
calcium homeostasis in the blood and
[SPEAKER_00]: another could be mechanical or
gravitational forces acting on the
[SPEAKER_00]: skeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll learn about these a little bit later
in this presentation but keep in mind that
[SPEAKER_00]: our remodeling is actually under two
different control loops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the structure of short irregular and
flat bones these are a little different
[SPEAKER_00]: choosing to compare these initially here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thin plates of compact bone just right
here and the outside of spongy bone and
[SPEAKER_00]: the dipole on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no ethicists here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can contain red bone marrow between
the trabeculae.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trabeculae are kind of these
structures that give this bone this kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of spongy look.
[SPEAKER_00]: In infants it's found in the medullar
cavity in the areas of long and spongy
[SPEAKER_00]: bone are red bone marrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember in adults found in the dipole of
flat bones and the head of the femur and
[SPEAKER_00]: also the humerus.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we age that red bone marrow is being
replaced with yellow bone marrow but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: still very important that as adults we
have red bone marrow to generate the
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary cells we need for the
circulatory system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Importance of ionic calcium in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium is necessary for many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transmission of nerve impulses,
muscle contraction, blood coagulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: secretion by glands and nerves,
and cell division.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important that we maintain a
distinct amount of calcium in our body
[SPEAKER_00]: more than just for bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: While bones themselves yes do compose
about 99% of the total calcium in our body
[SPEAKER_00]: that other 1% also has very important
functions in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: In class we read this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: So calcium intake, calcium bioavailability
and bone health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Discuss the bioavailability of calcium and
the impact that has on the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you're consuming the right
amount of calcium that calcium is not
[SPEAKER_00]: bioavailable that can impact the overall
health of the individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about this kind of regulating
calcium levels but there's two different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a hormonal mechanism where raising
blood calcium levels triggers the thyroid
[SPEAKER_00]: to release calcitonin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcitonin stimulates calcium salt
deposits in bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're having an increase in
calcium level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to get back to the normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are activating this calcitonin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of calcitonin as putting calcium in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stimulates calcium deposits in bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium levels are being brought into the
bone meaning they're being reduced at the
[SPEAKER_00]: circulatory system level and we're
returning to that normal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a normal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're increasing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're releasing calcitonin putting the
calcium in being reabsorbed into the bones
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is what's decreasing the calcium
levels in the blood causing it to reach a
[SPEAKER_00]: normal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to keep in mind we have to also
worry about the other side of things if
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium levels drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have falling calcium levels this
can signal this glands to release this
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone called PTH.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is released osteoclasts release
calcium from the bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium is reabsorbed from the urine and
kidneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is increasing our calcium levels and
getting them back to the normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind if we notice a decrease in
calcium levels we're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: osteoclasts release calcium, break down
calcium from the bone to maintain this
[SPEAKER_00]: very vital 1% in our circulatory system.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the hormonal conditions we
also have mechanical stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wolf's Law as a bone grows or remodels in
response to forces or demands placed upon
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long bones are thickest midway through the
shaft where bending stress is greatest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Curved bones are thickest where they're
most likely to buckle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows some compression and tension
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember compression forces are when we
push something together and tension would
[SPEAKER_00]: be pulling something apart here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common if you've ever researched stresses
on bridges your bones are going through
[SPEAKER_00]: that same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This mechanical stress can cause bones to
be remodeled in a way where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: strengthening the weakest part on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trabeculi remember form along the
lines of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a webbing material here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large bony projections occur where heavy
active muscles attach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind on the ways to move these
the muscles need points to attachment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also going to be an area where
we're having this increased response to
[SPEAKER_00]: this mechanical stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the forces that are applied we want to
make sure our bones are nice strong and
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy and they can remodel or strengthen
areas of potential weakness to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of them buckling breaking or even
fracturing.
