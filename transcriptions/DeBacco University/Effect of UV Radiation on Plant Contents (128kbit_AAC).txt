[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to be looking at
the effects of UV or ultraviolet radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: on plant contents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one may be familiar with UV radiation
as being something to be of caution to,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also can be used to kind of reveal
certain things when we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: developing money that's hard to
counterfeit and can make certain liquids
[SPEAKER_00]: glow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is something, UV radiation is
something to be concerned about,
[SPEAKER_00]: and typically we will see that associated
with sunglasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So UV light, there's different forms,
UVC, UVB, UVA, UVA accounts for about 95%
[SPEAKER_00]: of the UV radiation reaching the Earth's
surface, while UVB is a chief cause for
[SPEAKER_00]: skin reddening and sunburn, and tends to
damage the skin's more superficial
[SPEAKER_00]: epidermal layers, and that's the outer
portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: UVC is filtered out by the ozone and the
stratosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are in addition to visible light,
as we see here, there's UVA and UVB,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see the different wavelengths
that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That UVA can penetrate deeper into our
skin than UVB, which extends to stay more
[SPEAKER_00]: in the epidermal layer closer to our
skin's surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's being shown here is that
lettuce is affected by UV light
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing the right type of green leaf
lettuce during the winter in a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: and exposing it to the right type of
ultraviolet light can boost levels
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritionally of carotenoids according to
the agricultural resource service.
[SPEAKER_00]: So supplementing UVA plus UVB greatly
increased the carotenoid and chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations in green leaf lettuce
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's one example of how adjusting the
light can affect the outcome of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This master's thesis also looked at
lettuce production, and this thesis was
[SPEAKER_00]: published in the year 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they showed that the use of
supplemental light to improve the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of red lettuce is common practice in
today's greenhouse production,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the use of UV light treatments leads
to an increase in the synthesis of
[SPEAKER_00]: health-prone compounds, phenolic acids,
and flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's just another example of light
affecting the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now since we're going to relate this to
cannabis here, the importance of UV light
[SPEAKER_00]: in trichome development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in cannabis, increased UVB radiation
resulted in increased THC levels in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just referred to the study here.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC just being a cannabinoid, maybe
something like this could also be applied
[SPEAKER_00]: to CBD production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichomes can block harmful UVB rays from
reaching the sensitive photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, these trichomes that are
being produced increase numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought the function almost is like a
shading effect or a sunblock for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went a melon and protects the skin
from UVB damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, plants are producing higher
trichomes, which in return are producing
[SPEAKER_00]: higher cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the plants that we're giving the
artificial light to, we may want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: considering lights that produce the UV
light part of the spectrum to help
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the cannabinoids that they can
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
