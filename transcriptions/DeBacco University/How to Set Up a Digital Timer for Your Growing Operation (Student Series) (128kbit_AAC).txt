[SPEAKER_01]: In this DeBaco University Student Series
video, we're going to go over how to set
[SPEAKER_01]: up a digital timer for your growing
operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're a little confused exactly
what all those buttons do, hopefully this
[SPEAKER_01]: will provide you with the explanation so
you can utilize it to its greatest
[SPEAKER_01]: effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, today we're going to be showing you
how to set up a digital timer so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could automate your grow by using this
timer to time your pumps or your lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what you will see when you open
up your digital timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little different from the
mechanical timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, we have a few more
buttons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the ability to adjust the day of
the week, the hour, the minute,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even the second.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our reset button to set the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hold down this clock button and hit
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first I'd want to change the day of
the week to reflect that it is Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd hit clock and week until it hits
Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then while still holding clock,
I would change the hour to 4 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still holding clock, I'm going to change
the minutes over to 4
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to set when we want our timer lights
to come on and off, we're going to hit
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is when we want our lights
to turn on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like how we were setting up our clock,
we're going to hit the hour button.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want mine to turn on at midnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just those same buttons for the
hour and minute to adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to set for when you want the
lights to turn off, you hit program again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to set it for 6 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights turn off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hold down, it'll make it go faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once you're done setting the on and
off time, you can hit clock again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that it says auto on
the bottom down here, since that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: only way this timer will automatically
turn your lights on and off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the option for on, which keeps
them on constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or off, which turns them off constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want auto so that it reflects the
timing that you just set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're done programming your
schedule, you're going to want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that the timer says auto on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will make sure that it'll perform to
the hours that you set it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also turn it on so that it is on
constantly or off so that the lights are
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
Thanks for watching.
