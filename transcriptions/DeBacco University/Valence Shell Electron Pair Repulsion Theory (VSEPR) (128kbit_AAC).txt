[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at the
valence shell electron pair repulsion
[SPEAKER_00]: theory, or VESPR, which I know is a
mouthful, but we can kind of break it
[SPEAKER_00]: apart and understand at least the pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Valence shell electron, those are the
electrons in the outer most shell,
[SPEAKER_00]: pairs to repulsion theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, because electrons have negative
charges, two negative charges want to
[SPEAKER_00]: repel one another, so this is kind of
taking on the particular shape that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the purpose of this video lecture,
we're looking at can you identify certain
[SPEAKER_00]: shapes of molecules?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the valence shell electron pair
repulsion theory, or VESPR, assumes that a
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule will form a structure that will
minimize the repulsion between valence
[SPEAKER_00]: electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also known as the AXE notation,
A standing for the central atom,
[SPEAKER_00]: X for the terminal atoms, E for the free
electron pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we try to depict here is when
there's a line that's in the same plane,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we see the black kind of triangle
that is kind of like coming towards us,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when we see the dots that's going away
from us here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another YouTube video, if you want to
check it out, I hear it from a different
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, you'll want to check that one
out also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting into it, why is this important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we need to understand shape?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, molecular shape and function are
very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: A molecule's shape is very important to
its function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biological molecules recognize and
interact with each other with specificity
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the molecular shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molecules with similar shapes can have
similar biological effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just, I did the example here of
hemoglobin and chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you kind of look at them quick,
they look very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hemoglobin's going to be in red blood
cells, chlorophyll, and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we study bones, how they kind of have
a lot of similar shape and function here,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see the human, which is the dog,
the bird, and the whale, how these
[SPEAKER_00]: particular bones may have similar
functions for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the five basic structures, and we'll
get into them in detail, I presented them
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's linear, trigonal planar,
tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramid,
[SPEAKER_00]: and octahedron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with the most basic, a linear
molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Linear molecule has bonding orbitals 180
degrees apart, producing a molecule of
[SPEAKER_00]: linear geometry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I gave you a picture of this,
could you identify this as a linear
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule is what I'd be looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: This example is just carbon dioxide,
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example here, trigonal planar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one atom at the center, and three atoms
at the corners of an equilateral triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you understand for this one,
trigonal planar, there's three here
[SPEAKER_00]: forming a triangle all on the same plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all on the same plane there,
so it's trigonal, there's three of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're all on the same plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a way you can easily identify
and recognize a molecule with this shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boron tetrafluoride is an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more concerned that you can recognize
the shape, identify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on, tetrahedral.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a tetrahedral molecular geometry is a
central atom located at the center with
[SPEAKER_00]: four substituents that are located at the
corners of the tetrahedron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this tetrahedral, tetra meaning four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we count them, one, two,
three, four, which four here binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Xenon tetraoxide here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of a tetrahedral
molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on, trigonal bipyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trigonal bipyramid has one atom at the
center and five more atoms at the corners
[SPEAKER_00]: of the trigonal dipyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one gets a little confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trigonal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we remember trigonal planar,
here's our three in the same plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bipyramid, this forms a pyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be pyramid one, and then this forms
a pyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be pyramid two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's our two pyramids, and here's
our trigonal planar area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the proper term for this molecule,
phosphorus pentafluoride, trigonal
[SPEAKER_00]: bipyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one here, octahedral.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an octahedral molecular geometry
describes the shapes of components with
[SPEAKER_00]: six atoms or groups of an atom or ligands
symmetrically arranged around a central
[SPEAKER_00]: atom, defining the vertices of an
octahedron.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the heck does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's break that down as an easy way
to recognize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfur hexafluoride is an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Octahedral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, there's one, two, three,
four, five, there's six binding points.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only one with six points here,
that would be an octahedral molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, for purposes of this,
I just want to identify the shape with the
[SPEAKER_00]: name and not go any further.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get into chemistry, you'll get into
this in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for right now, if I show you a shape
of a molecule, can you properly describe
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
So let's go ahead and do that.
