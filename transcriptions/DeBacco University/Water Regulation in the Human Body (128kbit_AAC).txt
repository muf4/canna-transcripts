[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to look at water
regulation in the human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a separate video with osmo
regulation relating to fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at the human
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an extreme case of water
dehydration in the case of the mummy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get a little bit more of a
realistic situation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anti-diuretic hormone, ADH, is part of a
negative feedback system that regulates
[SPEAKER_00]: water in the mammalian body.
[SPEAKER_00]: ADH increases the permeability of distal
tubules, allowing for greater water
[SPEAKER_00]: recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a person is given a dose
of ADH, then more water will be retained
[SPEAKER_00]: by the kidneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does this look in an actual
situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're outside, heat will cause water
loss through dehydration through the
[SPEAKER_00]: process of sweating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Receptors in the hypothalamus,
which is located in the brain,
[SPEAKER_00]: detect the increased blood osmolarity and
signal the pituitary gland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the pituitary gland located right
here that will release ADH into the
[SPEAKER_00]: bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that ADH is released into the
bloodstream, that will cause an increase
[SPEAKER_00]: in the permeability of the distal tubule
in the nephron in the collecting duct.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows more water to be reabsorbed
into the blood to get our nephron
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water will be retained in the body and
concentrated urine is produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that urine is concentrated because the
body is retaining more water, meaning that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's excreting less water, concentrating
the urine, giving it more of a yellow to
[SPEAKER_00]: dark yellow appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now caffeine and alcohol and diuretics,
alcohol inhibits ADH release while
[SPEAKER_00]: caffeine interferes with its activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the symptoms of a hangover are
actually due to dehydration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what causes dehydration in this case?
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is a cup of coffee not a good cure
for a hangover?
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at some of the items here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our brewed coffee having,
in this comparison, the highest amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: caffeine per cup, instant coffee,
Red Bull, black tea, can of cola,
[SPEAKER_00]: shot of espresso, green tea is decreasing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decaffeinated coffee, though, will have
less caffeine because it is decaffeinated,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it still does not contain zero,
contains less, but not completely
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminated entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diuretics and weight loss, so many
over-the-counter herbal diets claim to
[SPEAKER_00]: detoxify the body or flush fat out of the
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, many of these contain dandelion
leaves or parsley or other herbs known to
[SPEAKER_00]: be diuretics which increase the amount of
water and salt expelled from the body as
[SPEAKER_00]: urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that's the case, we want to consider
if a person tries one of these products
[SPEAKER_00]: and appears to lose pounds, what are they
actually losing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they actually losing fat?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are losing weight, but is it actually
in the form of fat?
[SPEAKER_00]: So consider what's going on particularly
with the kidneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if they continue to use these for an
extended period of time, could there be
[SPEAKER_00]: health problems associated with these
products that are claiming to flush fat
[SPEAKER_00]: and detoxify the body?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're diuretics, an increasing amount
of water and salt expelled from the body's
[SPEAKER_00]: urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So consider that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, and in the last case, the kangaroo
rat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This long tail, the kangaroo rat is
adapted for the desert life and being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to survive with very little water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to consider some ways in which
its kidneys might be different from the
[SPEAKER_00]: human kidney to allow it to conserve as
much water as possible, even if it was in
[SPEAKER_00]: a very arid environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may say looking at these pictures
here, well, it can just get water from the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It just eats the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's not a lot of plants
available in the desert environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has kidneys adapted to help it
survive with very little water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want you to consider how the kidneys
of the kangaroo rat may differ from a
[SPEAKER_00]: human kidney.
[SPEAKER_00]: What might be going on there to help it
live in an environment where water is very
[SPEAKER_00]: scarce?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comments below.
