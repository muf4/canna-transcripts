[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this tobacco university video,
going over using aeroponics to clone
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll not only go over some of the steps
here in a video lecture, at the end I will
[SPEAKER_00]: actually show you the process that you
would go through to utilize this and take
[SPEAKER_00]: what you learn and put it into action.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into using aeroponics
to clone cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, realize that aeroponics,
you can purchase them or you can have a
[SPEAKER_00]: homemade kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants really don't care as long as the
basics are provided on a consistent basis
[SPEAKER_00]: to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not great swings or variability
as you're going through this propagation
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purchase systems offer a quick plug and
play option and have increased upfront
[SPEAKER_00]: cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Homemade kits may take a little bit of
refinement to go through to make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: get it dialed just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Easy Clone is one of the standards in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very efficient aeroponic cloning
machine and I'll use this one as an
[SPEAKER_00]: example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also on this channel, I have a more
detailed video specifically going over the
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy Clone there because it is such an
effective system and used on a large
[SPEAKER_00]: scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the key step to any aeroponic cloner is
you want to have all the equipment set up,
[SPEAKER_00]: functional, stabilized, and tested before
you take the actual cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers get in and want to take
the cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be the very last step.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure you have everything
set up ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a system that has several parts,
it's possible for a small, seemingly
[SPEAKER_00]: insignificant component to hold up the
entire operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give the example here of these little
misters.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you break one or if it's not sitting
right, may not spray right, and that could
[SPEAKER_00]: affect the entire system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So key step, have everything set up ahead
of time, equipment wise, before you even
[SPEAKER_00]: think about taking your cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to focus on the physical
parts first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you have everything that is
needed physically set up, check
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, make sure all the pieces are
present, make sure they all fit together,
[SPEAKER_00]: and make sure they're all working
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: With an aeroponic cloner, you want to make
sure you have the pumps working,
[SPEAKER_00]: the filters, you have enough foam disks,
your spray nozzles are all clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you also have a drain plug oriented in
the right methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're done, it will be easier to
take down this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this again shows you the Easy Clone,
some of the assembly of materials that is
[SPEAKER_00]: required to make it operate properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now checking that support equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's that support equipment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're growing in a grow tent,
make sure that's all set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the zippers are all working,
make sure your lights are functional and
[SPEAKER_00]: hung properly, you should get the right
bulb in there, the right intensity,
[SPEAKER_00]: the right spacing, your ventilation,
make sure your fans are all working,
[SPEAKER_00]: your temperature is not getting too hot,
too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have a water monitoring
system, put the water in it, along with
[SPEAKER_00]: any nutrient solutions you might be
adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just check all these to make sure
they're all 100% functional and ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: receive the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that water and related items that I
mentioned, the water quality is the PPM,
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperature, the pH, make sure those
are all dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's typically done with a water
monitor, here I used a blue LabGuardian
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor, and any water additives here,
I'm using the clone X clone gel on the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual plants, and then also the solution
in the actual aeroponic cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the general targets that I shoot
for, 730 parts per million, 74 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit, and a pH around 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now put it all together, make sure
everything's running properly,
[SPEAKER_00]: allow for everything to run for a period
of time, it's also important to ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is stable and within acceptable
ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your temperature might fluctuate a little
bit when that pump's running, that pump
[SPEAKER_00]: gets warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, make sure everything is within
acceptable ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding the clone is the very last step,
and it's probably the most fun step,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is definitely the last step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant additions are at the very end,
make sure everything else is checked and
[SPEAKER_00]: also rechecked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to minimize the transition
time to enter the propagating,
[SPEAKER_00]: supportive environment, help reduce the
chance of plant loss, help maximize your
[SPEAKER_00]: chance at cloning or rooting of those
vegetative-propagated clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that I've kind of gone through this
all, well, let's see it in action.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'll go through the process,
and I hope you enjoy this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here I'm gonna show you the
cuttings we took earlier, how to get them
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to go into the aeroponic cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is one of the clones we took
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's wet because it just came
out of this beaker full of water to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one doesn't need too much trimming,
but we are gonna do it to try to maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: the rooting potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm gonna do is I've got some
Clonex gel here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a rooting hormone, it's a simple
oxen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And take our clone, we're gonna put that
into the gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see now it's got, it's coating
with that purple coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take our little foam, foam cube here,
sorry, foam circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gonna take our little, take our little
foam circle here, put that around the
[SPEAKER_00]: collar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this area is gonna be what's
gonna root.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gonna be the area that's gonna be
rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is gonna be the top growth
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna add this to our aeroponic
z-cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm gonna show you how we go about
cloning a cannabis plant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here was one cutting we just took from
the mother or stock plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, because we're gonna be putting it
into an aeroponic cloner, we're gonna have
[SPEAKER_00]: this foam collar to put around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, we do not wanna have
anything in that dark environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just gonna rot and have a chance for
mold or disease to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna take this node right here,
we're just gonna break that section off
[SPEAKER_00]: right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can discard these portions,
we don't need those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw those right in the trash there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got our clone basically ready to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, to increase the odds of rooting,
I'm gonna take some Clonex gel,
[SPEAKER_00]: put some of that on the end there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here that gel really sticks
well to the bottom of that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it's gonna be rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I go through and I take the foam
circular disc there, put that around,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's ultimately what's gonna hold the
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we can start to see how this is
going to increase the odds of a favorable
[SPEAKER_00]: rooting environment while also keeping the
top growth quite well established there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is ultimately gonna go in to the
z-cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
