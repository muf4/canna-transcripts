[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at
isolating mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: What things may keep certain individuals
apart from one another that will influence
[SPEAKER_00]: the genes that are passed on to a
generation or that are prevented from
[SPEAKER_00]: intersecting with another species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reproductive isolated populations,
populations whose members do not mate with
[SPEAKER_00]: each other or cannot produce fertile
offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reproductive isolating mechanisms are the
barriers that prevent genetic exchange
[SPEAKER_00]: between species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have an original population here and
we're seeing a shift into two different
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated species here.
[SPEAKER_00]: With our examples of the flies we have
some that like starch and maltose and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a favoritism for one versus the
other and therefore we have individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: that may only mate with those that like a
certain food source separating out and
[SPEAKER_00]: causing subsets of the population to
develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowers, examples here, can select for
their pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some flowers have evolved to attract
only certain species to help them
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the white foxglobe flower is adapted
for bees and this long tube-shaped flower
[SPEAKER_00]: is better for hummingbirds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of flowers selecting
for certain pollinators to help attract
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is reproductive isolation because
the bees will not be going through and
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinating these flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This flower will be trying to match the
habits better of the hummingbird than the
[SPEAKER_00]: bee.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's pre-zygotic isolating mechanisms
and this prevents the formation of a
[SPEAKER_00]: zygote.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a barrier that somehow prevents
the sperm getting to the egg or the pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: to the egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's post-zygotic isolation
mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: These prevent the proper functioning of
the zygote after they've formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the zygote is forming but then
there's something that's preventing it
[SPEAKER_00]: from growing to a fully developed and
normally functioning individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temporal isolation occurs when two
populations differ in their periods of
[SPEAKER_00]: activity or reproductive cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examples of leopard frogs and the wood
frogs, they reach sexual maturity at
[SPEAKER_00]: different times in the spring and hence do
not interbreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of temporal
isolation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Behavioral isolation occurs when two
populations exhibit different courtship
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two crickets here and certain
populations produce different mating
[SPEAKER_00]: songs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a mate is only going to find the proper
individual that has the right song.
[SPEAKER_00]: If an individual is producing a different
tune or song or ritual, they will not be
[SPEAKER_00]: selected as part of a mate for that
particular population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the behaviors that an individual
exhibits can result in its isolation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's geographic isolation and this
occurs when two populations occupy
[SPEAKER_00]: different habitats or separate niches
within a common region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examples be lions and tigers occupy
different habitats and do not interbreed,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in different geographical areas,
therefore they're not breeding together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of gives a nice summary table of
both pre and post-zygotic isolating
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: One over the temporal, that's when they
mate at different times of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecological is when two species occupy
different habitats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Behavioral is when they have different
courtship behaviors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mechanical occurs when physical
differences prevent pollination,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, different sized dogs simply
mechanically cannot produce offspring
[SPEAKER_00]: because they can't physically mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post-zygotic isolating mechanisms could be
hybrid in viability, which means the
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids are produced but failed to develop
to reproductive maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also hybrid infertility, where hybrids
fail to produce functional gametes and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're sterile, an example of our mules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hybrid breakdown, where F1 hybrids are
fertile but F2 fails to develop properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are giving you some examples and
these are some more specific examples of
[SPEAKER_00]: the general pre and post-zygotic isolating
mechanisms.
Thank you.
