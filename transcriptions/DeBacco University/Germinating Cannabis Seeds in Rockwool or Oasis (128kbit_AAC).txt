[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at this video,
you're probably looking at germinating
[SPEAKER_00]: your cannabis seeds in Rockwell or Oasis,
and Tobacco University here is to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: you with some helpful tips and tricks to
increase the odds of your success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the video specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, when we're looking at
germinating seeds, we have to keep in mind
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have some basics to be sure we're
adhering to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure the seed is from a
certified source.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're keeping the temperature within the
accepted ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture level, target level, air
percentage, depth, and light all need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be adhered to for the basic environment to
help ensure the environment is supportive
[SPEAKER_00]: of basic seed germination properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now why would you use Rockwell or Oasis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, natural properties of both are
conducive to early plant establishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both materials hold water well while still
providing roots adequate air exchange,
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing them to respire and essentially
breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they often come in space efficient
trays with individual cubes per cut,
[SPEAKER_00]: which allow for very efficient production
on both a small scale as well as a large
[SPEAKER_00]: scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some specifics, particularly
to Rockwell?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to typically soak your Rockwell
first before planting seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes this may require soaking in
water that's pH tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's not required, it might be a
good idea and should be something pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: quick and easy for you to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically the small cubes are recommended
no matter where the seedling will be going
[SPEAKER_00]: for the rest of the growth cycle,
because they can be put into larger blocks
[SPEAKER_00]: as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common used example would be the GroDan OA
cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of a name brand, but they're
very established, particularly in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwell arena there for propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as the plant grows, we want to keep
this in mind that as the plant's growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cubes are designed to fit into larger
blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can see here, as a small cube,
they can easily be placed into this larger
[SPEAKER_00]: block as a pre-cut hole to allow during
the transplanting process, minimal root
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where GroDan Block Delta,
for example, they sell a series of
[SPEAKER_00]: different sizes that all fit into one
another that allow for that natural
[SPEAKER_00]: progression for a growing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now both substrates, this is again for
Rockwell and Oasis, are easily put into
[SPEAKER_00]: trays for easy mass production in a small
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow a lot of plants in a very
small square footage, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave one planting spot empty though,
if you're using a tray, particularly in
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle, so that the water in the tray
can be properly determined to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you're now under or over watering your
newly developing seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is true for both
substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also be used for clones as well
as seeds, but here provide you hopeful
[SPEAKER_00]: with some quick kind of general tips for
germinating your seeds in either Rockwell
[SPEAKER_00]: or Oasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, I hope you enjoyed
this video.
See you next time.
