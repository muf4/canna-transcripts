[SPEAKER_01]: In this Debaco University student series
video, we're going to take a look at
[SPEAKER_01]: proper fluorescent light settings to use
for clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be utilizing a PAR meter,
so I know many people can't justify the
[SPEAKER_01]: expense of a PAR meter, so hopefully this
video will give you some insight to know
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly how far and how to set up your
fluorescent lights so you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: successful cloning operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, now just before we get into the
video here, just realize these clones or
[SPEAKER_01]: these plant leaves are about eight inches
away from the light as a source of
[SPEAKER_01]: comparison.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the light used was an Agrobright
Designer T5 324 watt fluorescent light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was used and that's what we're going to
see because it offers these great
[SPEAKER_01]: adjustments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to see what adjustment
works best for our operation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've just switched over our lights
from our LED to our fluorescent lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because the LEDs were providing a
bit too high of a PAR reading for our
[SPEAKER_00]: liking, and so we wanted to move to
something a little less intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for this lighting setup, we have a few
different options.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has four of our lights on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This option has all of our lights on,
or this option has just two of our lights
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we need to figure out which is the
best for our grow operation, so we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to use a PAR meter to read each of
these lighting settings and determine
[SPEAKER_00]: which one is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we're at our lowest light
setting of just two of our lights on,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're reading at about 104,
103 PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend that you hold your
sensor just as a note at plant level
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of too high or too low just to
make sure that you're getting an
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're at our medium lighting option
with just two of our lights off,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're reading at a good 210 PAR
reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're at our highest setting with all
of our lights on, and we're reaching about
[SPEAKER_00]: 340 for our PAR reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on the size and shape of our clone
so far, our ideal PAR reading would be at
[SPEAKER_00]: around 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all of the lights on at 300 is a
little too much, but fortunately we have
[SPEAKER_00]: the option to dim it down by just turning
our middle two lights off to give us the
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect PAR reading of about 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and we'll see you
next time.
