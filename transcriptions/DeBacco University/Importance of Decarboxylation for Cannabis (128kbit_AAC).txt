[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBacco University video,
I'm going to go over the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: decarboxylation for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go over a brief introduction of what
this actually is from a chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint, as well as go over a
scientific study to give you some
[SPEAKER_00]: specifics that you can look for when going
through this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a research article.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find the screenshot of the first
page right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as a proper citation if you want
to look at this study in more details.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll provide you with a brief overview
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, starting with the very
basics, is just what is decarboxylation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, all cannabinoids that are contained
within the trichomes of raw cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: flower consist of cannabinoids in their
acidic form and have an extra carboxyl
[SPEAKER_00]: ring or group attached to the chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from a chemistry standpoint,
that's a carbon with two oxygens and a
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The decarboxylation, or typically called
decarbing, is where raw cannabis is heated
[SPEAKER_00]: so that the chemical structure of the acid
cannabinoids changes to a neutral or
[SPEAKER_00]: non-acid form.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also, if you notice right below me
here, can also change in visual
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're simply breaking off that bond there
through the process of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the acidic to neutral form conversion,
what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is when one states that the
cannabinoids are in their acidic form,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're referring to the chemical
structure of the compound itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: A cannabinoid that is in its acidic form
has a carboxyl group attached and the
[SPEAKER_00]: neutral forms will have the carboxyl group
simply removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So acid is the raw plant material and the
neutral form is a decarboxylated compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does that look from a structure
standpoint?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we can see THCA and CBDA in their
acid form or how they'd be found on the
[SPEAKER_00]: raw plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: When heat is added, we can see they both
convert to their neutral form with the
[SPEAKER_00]: loss here of carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that also pictured on this
side as well, where we see the acidic
[SPEAKER_00]: forms are considered to be the inactive
forms and then through the deep
[SPEAKER_00]: carboxylation process with heat and time,
you get into the active forms or the
[SPEAKER_00]: neutral forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the chemical structure changes just to
show that in a little bit more detail
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This transforming of the cannabinoid acids
into their neutral forms needs to simply
[SPEAKER_00]: remove that carboxyl group there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weak bond holding the carboxyl group
can be broken by a combination of heat as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This describes the process of
decarboxylation because you're removing
[SPEAKER_00]: our carboxyl group due to high temperature
or combustion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The major difference chemically between
the acid cannabinoids and their neutral
[SPEAKER_00]: counterparts is that extra bond there of
that carboxyl group.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's known as a carboxyl group again from
a scientific chemistry standpoint,
[SPEAKER_00]: which consists of a carbon, oxygen,
oxygen, hydrogen molecule cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's simply what's being broken off
and removed causing the conversion from
[SPEAKER_00]: the acidic form to that neutral form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a loss of carbon dioxide in the
process as shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why do we need to go through this
process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this even important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we need to go through carboxylation
or decarboxylation?
[SPEAKER_00]: This process essentially converts the
chemicals to an active form by increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: the body's ability to absorb and bind the
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially the body can use the active
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carboxylation happens naturally when the
plant material is ignited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through that heating process,
through that combustion process,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a natural way to add heat and
through time to convert the acidic form to
[SPEAKER_00]: that neutral form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the importance of this process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Converting of THCA versus just regular
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while THCA is non-psychoactive,
not a decarboxylated form, it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: precursor to THC, which is the
decarboxylated form.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does not bind to the CB1 and CB2
receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just note that THCA binds with other
cannabinoid receptors in the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why active is usually in quotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although THCA poses some therapeutic
effects, like anti-inflammatory and
[SPEAKER_00]: neuro-predictive qualities, it is not the
most beneficial, nor is it the
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not saying that THCA is
completely not able to be utilized by the
[SPEAKER_00]: body, but it doesn't seem like it binds as
well to the CB1 and CB2 receptors compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to its neutral form, THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this decarboxylation does require heat
and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two main catalysts for this
process to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drying and curing cannabis over time will
cause a partial decarboxylation to occur,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the heat and time will speed up that
process and make it more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heating of the cannabinoids to a lower
temperature over time allows the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids to be decarboxylated while
preserving the integrity of the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically here we're talking about
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is used so that it can be
incorporated into what is ultimately going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see this kind of like conversion
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice that THCA is decreasing,
at the same time THC would be increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's that general conversion graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of, I have the picture of the
seesaw here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that like inverse
relationship here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shows the theoretical conversion
of the acidic forms of THC and CBD to the
[SPEAKER_00]: neutral forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice the inverse relationship as the
amounts change.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end, THC and CBD remain in high
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's basically happening here,
this line is representing THCA and you see
[SPEAKER_00]: when that starts to drop and go down,
the presence or concentration of THC
[SPEAKER_00]: increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing can be applied to CBDA
and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that inverse relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's being converted to another,
so that's where you're getting kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: that seesaw-like conversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now test results before and after
decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis flowers are often tested for both
THC as well as THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that THC is often found in small
percentages in fresh flower because it has
[SPEAKER_00]: not gone through the heat and the time to
decarboxylate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see here, here's THC and
there's THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see after that decarboxylation
process, we can see that conversion here
[SPEAKER_00]: is a lot more THC compared to THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just important note there,
and a lot of times labs do test for both,
[SPEAKER_00]: even in a regular dry flower, so that
grower can have an understanding as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as a consumer of that potential conversion
to the amount of desirable cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's the best decarboxylation
temperature for CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we're going to look at CBD as
well as THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some dispute over the exact
decarboxylation temperature for CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to studies, however,
it appears to be approximately 213 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit or 110 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for the timeframe, neither THC nor CBD
will decarboxylate instantaneously at
[SPEAKER_00]: their precise decarb temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like you hit that temperature
and you get that automatic conversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is still a time factor to take into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: A longer period, typically between 40 and
60 minutes, will be required for that
[SPEAKER_00]: carboxyl group to break down into water
and carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit of a range there to
give you a general idea, but it's not like
[SPEAKER_00]: instantaneous you hit that temperature and
100% converts, there needs to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: duration of time also considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, don't get decarboxylation
temperatures confused with boiling points
[SPEAKER_00]: because they are not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now boiling points for cannabinoids,
terpenes, flavonoids, have been much more
[SPEAKER_00]: thoroughly studied than decarboxylation
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boiling points for the compounds are all
provided here in Fahrenheit and Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's kind of more of a pictorial
graph here giving you some more
[SPEAKER_00]: information, but this is what was provided
in the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: These boiling points are not the same as
decarboxylation temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit easier to study, a little bit
more published, but you have to be aware
[SPEAKER_00]: of what number you're looking at,
what that correlates with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you want to avoid high
temperatures, it's important to keep a
[SPEAKER_00]: tight temperature control applying
cannabis to various technological
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: While heat is needed to decarboxylate the
acids into the active form of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, our bodies can use extreme
temperatures can destroy many of these
[SPEAKER_00]: important plant materials that contribute
to positive health outcomes such as
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If cannabis is heated above 300 degrees
Fahrenheit, you need to run the risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: denaturing many important other plant
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just the concept of more heat
is better, there we have to be careful
[SPEAKER_00]: with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's also compounds that will
volatilate and evaporate at higher
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures and this can result in an
unpleasant odor as well as an unpleasant
[SPEAKER_00]: taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So too much heat, too much is just going
to cause a degradation of that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you simply want to use the minimum
temperature basically to try to preserve
[SPEAKER_00]: those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is advisable to keep the
decarboxylation temperatures at a low
[SPEAKER_00]: point to preserve terpenes as well as
other compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each individual terpene may have its own
therapeutic benefits, but this also
[SPEAKER_00]: carries its own sensitivity to heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If terpenes are to be stored, the
temperature in the range of 230 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit should be maintained there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not looking at heating up too high,
start getting above certain theoretical
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures and they will break down and
we don't want to lose those terpenes that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've spent so much time in the plant
growing, breaking those down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now maintaining consistent temperature is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this process, a digital oven,
a safe thermometer is recommended so that
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperature that works best for the
final product can be continually
[SPEAKER_00]: monitored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're using an oven, limit the
number of times you open the door during
[SPEAKER_00]: the decarboxylation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will cause temperature
fluctuations and will reduce consistency
[SPEAKER_00]: and total yield of the decarboxylation
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at a graph of the
temperatures, you don't want to have these
[SPEAKER_00]: that have these like large swings in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have very minimal noise,
data noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have a graph that looks more
like this because that will ensure a more
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent temperature and a more
consistent repeatable process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now speeding up the process, what a lot of
people want to do, kind of we see here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just as if you drive too fast,
that can have negative effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the key to faster decarboxylation is
known to be greater heat and this should
[SPEAKER_00]: be a clear process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also speeding up the process can result in
a reduction of the quality of the end
[SPEAKER_00]: product and we don't want to kind of
avoid, we want to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now cannabis trim, trim is what is removed
from the final flower after harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trim includes sugar leaves, bits of cut
off buds, and knocked off trichomes or
[SPEAKER_00]: keef.
[SPEAKER_00]: This portion of the plant is considered
low quality and is usually reserved for
[SPEAKER_00]: making edibles, hash, pre-rolls,
or simply just used for extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I mention this and
define this is we're going to see this
[SPEAKER_00]: study uses these terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want you to understand what this
plant material it's referring to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now going to the other portion here,
the keef explained.
[SPEAKER_00]: When trichomes dry and break off the plant
becomes this keef product, which is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a popular byproduct of weed
consumption and is often used for edible
[SPEAKER_00]: creations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keef has oxidized and lost its freshness
when separated from the plant buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually has a darker color than trichomes,
ranging from a light gold to kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: brown coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of the rendition you see here in this
image.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a powdery appearance and a texture
that is somewhat sticky, often less so
[SPEAKER_00]: than trichomes on the actual bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keef tends to decarb faster than an intact
flower, so keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at the temperatures and
suggestions for the decarboxylation
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the temperature and times chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So suggested times for different
temperatures are provided for the type of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid, either THC or CBD,
and the material being decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it flower or is it keef?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see here the temperature
ranges here, the heating mode,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant material time for high THC and
high CBD, keef or hash time, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis oil time is all provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see how they're fluctuations in
time based on temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really didn't do a lot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this one, the hot oil bath focused
more on the oven and they used a boiling
[SPEAKER_00]: water bath as well here with the suggested
times below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a link.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely pause the video or
search the primary source as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now THC content does change over time
exposed to different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the highest concentration of THC,
which in this case was about 15 milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: per gram, is about obtained when the
material is decarboxylated at 122 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius for 27 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of see the graph provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at kind of this,
this one right here being kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal for 27 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of lining up right here and
you'll notice again, it doesn't happen
[SPEAKER_00]: instantaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does start to break down and then it
kind of peaks out and tapers off kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: plateaus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to run it for too long
because we could get a degradation at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that 20 to 27 minutes, 27 minutes being
suggested by the data presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now changes in content at least in
percentage of the main cannabinoids before
[SPEAKER_00]: and after the decarboxylation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's the cannabinoids, THCA and THC,
the acidic form, the neutral form,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBDA and CBD, CBN and then the moisture
and the total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing before decarboxylation,
the content again in percentages and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can notice that THCA quite high and then
we see THC being relatively low.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 minutes of decarboxylation compared to
60 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that THCA almost degrades to
nothing, which as we would expect and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: being converted because it's simply being
converted to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see the same pattern here for CBDA
being converted to CBD and then CBN and
[SPEAKER_00]: then a moisture there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's important just to remember that
the acidic forms are being converted to
[SPEAKER_00]: their biologically active neutral forms
during this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that the longer 60 minutes in this
case, basically right below me,
[SPEAKER_00]: time caused a reduction in total
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that highlighted right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We peaked here at 30 minutes at the 30.3,
went down to 27.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the content of CBDA before
decarboxylation was 0.6 and an hour after
[SPEAKER_00]: decarboxylation decreased to 0.3 and we
can see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the CBD content before was 0%,
we see that right here and after 30
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes was increased to 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're seeing that time,
we're seeing that conversion process
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the heat and the time from the
acidic form to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I just want to leave you with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to understand that there's
other factors of variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't just a necessary set cut and
dry chemical process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The variety of the cannabis being used,
the age or freshness of the product,
[SPEAKER_00]: the equipment being used and the flower
uniformity all play a role in this
[SPEAKER_00]: decarboxylation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So variety of cannabis being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just touch on that here for a
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go into each of these a
little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each type of cannabis contains different
amounts of ratios of different
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and terpenes, which impact
the optimum decarboxylation time as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also be impacted by the physical
structure of the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take that into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since each cannabinoid and terpene
decarboxylates at different temperatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing what the plant naturally contains
will impact the temperature protocol that
[SPEAKER_00]: should be implemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're focusing on a type one,
a type two, a type three, what specific
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes might be of high presence in your
particular cultivar variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being used also age and freshness of the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a noticeable differences in
the final product, depending on the age or
[SPEAKER_00]: freshness of the material you start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This really impacts the amount of
degradation that may occur before
[SPEAKER_00]: decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the decarboxylation process only
converts the acidic form from the form to
[SPEAKER_00]: the bioactive neutral form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not create CBD or create the THC
molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a conversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're taking the egg and you're breaking
that carboxyl group off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're left with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a creation of a molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a conversion of a molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now also the equipment being used and this
could be a high source of variability
[SPEAKER_00]: because you want to reduce that
variability and the ability to maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: precise temperature will have a direct
impact on the total yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing monitoring the temperature is
also important.
[SPEAKER_00]: In oven or other systems such as a cooker,
slow cooker or instant cooker is used,
[SPEAKER_00]: there will be a small variability in the
cooking equipment that may affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may also affect the repeatability of
your protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why equipment intended for this
purpose is recommended such as a
[SPEAKER_00]: decarboxylation jacketed glass reactor or
other professional oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have more repeatability.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have less variability,
but you are going to pay more for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower uniformity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another factor to take into
consideration as this can refer to the
[SPEAKER_00]: size, but also the density of the final
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greater the consistency of the size
and density will allow for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent decarboxylation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an extreme example, a fine cannabis or
powdered Keef will require a much shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: cooking time to prevent burning and
denaturing of the important compounds in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant compared to an intact flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the flower consistency varies widely,
then grinding up the plant material will
[SPEAKER_00]: help increase the uniformity of the
decarboxylation process or doing runs or
[SPEAKER_00]: batches of flowers with the same
uniformity will help increase your ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to have this repeatable and consistent end
result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just some general key points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep in mind that you need to have at
higher temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keef and hash tend to decarboxylate faster
than dried flowers simply because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: More surface area all ground up there,
going to have a greater chance of that
[SPEAKER_00]: heat penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: High CBD strains tend to decarboxylate a
bit slower than those with high THC
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just having that knowing what you're
expecting from your compounds can help you
[SPEAKER_00]: plan for that in the protocol process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three main factors with any
decarboxylation, it's important parameters
[SPEAKER_00]: to perform a good decarboxylation are the
time or duration, the temperature at which
[SPEAKER_00]: you keep the oven or heating device at,
and the quality of decarboxylation
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment for consistency as well as
repeatability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lastly, if you just want the basic
suggestions here, if you've made it this
[SPEAKER_00]: far into the video, suggestions for
decarboxylation in your own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the review of the published
literature, highest concentration of THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is about 15 milligrams per gram,
is obtained when the material is
[SPEAKER_00]: decarboxylated at 122 degrees Celsius for
27 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're looking at converting CBD
to CBD, a higher temperature is required,
[SPEAKER_00]: about 150 degrees Celsius, and a suggested
time for about 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at decarboxylating Keef
or hash in an oven, bake it for about 10
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes at 300 degrees Fahrenheit,
which is about 149 degrees Celsius there
[SPEAKER_00]: for consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this gives you a general idea of
a really good starting point as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: other factors to consider that you may not
have originally thought of to ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting the most quality end
product from your starting material.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't have a good grow or good
protocols to begin with and you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: good flour, this will do the best it can,
but keep in mind you need to have it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant to be able to decarboxylate it
to get that final end product result that
[SPEAKER_00]: you desire.
Thank you.
