[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're looking at symbiosis,
and this is a prime example of the title
[SPEAKER_00]: image right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the rhino, has a symbiotic
relationship with the red-billed oxpecker
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the symbiotic relationship between
these two different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go into a little bit more of what
this actually means.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we look at this, well, symbiosis,
let's define it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the condition in which two or more
kinds of organisms live together in close
[SPEAKER_00]: associations with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's major kinds that try to,
this kind of image gives you a good kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of comparison between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a communalism where one species
benefits and the other neither benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: nor is harmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one that's benefiting and one
that's not harmed but really doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit either from their relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have parasitism where one species
benefits while the other is harmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have the species benefiting and
the other one is actually harmed in this
[SPEAKER_00]: case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mutualism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both participating species have a benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the third type of symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can occur in aquatic environments
as well as terrestrial ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be mindful that this is
occurring not just on land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look more specifically at mutualism
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A symbiotic relationship in which both
species benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example with ants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, aphids provide the ants with food in
the form of continuously excreted
[SPEAKER_00]: honeydew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's honeydew from the leaves or
piercing the leaf parts and sugars coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what the ants are feeding off
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ants transport the aphids and protect them
from predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aphids typically are fed on by lady
beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, the ant offers protection
for the aphids in exchange for the
[SPEAKER_00]: honeydew that it will provide from the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a mutual benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aphid is getting the benefit of being
moved around and protected and the ant
[SPEAKER_00]: gets the benefit of the honeydew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ants and archaids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So archaids provide the ants with food in
the form of belton bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ants provide these archaids with organic
nutrients and protect them from herbivores
[SPEAKER_00]: and shading from other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, mutualistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both species are benefiting in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parasitism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a symbiotic relationship that is the
form of predation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the predator or parasite is much
smaller than the prey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the prey does not necessarily die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in parasitism, we have the example of
the mosquito and the human here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one benefiting and one has a
native effect here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the mosquito and the human.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the sea lamprey and the fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the lion and the wildebeest here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So parasitism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, external parasites is an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ectoparasites feed on the exterior surface
of an organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an example of this is ticks feeding at
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are ectoparasites because they're
feeding on the surface of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parasitoids are insects or wasps that lay
eggs on a living host.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a parasitic wasp will lay eggs inside
of an insect and then they'll grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: multiply, and divide within that insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prime example is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hornworms that feed on tomato plants could
be infected with a parasitic wasp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here the offspring here is
basically eating the hornworm from the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I included a little bit of a video here if
you want to check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the link to the slides is in the
description.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have here with this hornworm scanning
fed from the inside out that will stop its
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it not only saves the tomato plant,
but also cause more parasitic wasps to be
[SPEAKER_00]: in the local area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have something called endoparasites,
which live within the bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endo-mean inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the bodies of vertebrates and
invigorates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marked by much more extensive
specialization than external parasites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So external parasites are kind of like
grazers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here endoparasites need this very specific
match.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be in a specific area of the
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be targeting certain organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're much more specialized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But endoparasites refer to parasites on
the inside of an organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brood parasites are birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lay eggs in the nest of other
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So brood species reduce the reproductive
success of the foster parent host.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all these eggs and one looks like
it doesn't belong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is actually a cowbird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a brood parasite, meaning the female
cowbird lays its eggs in the nest of,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, the Eastern Phoebe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Eastern Phoebe is going to take care of
all the young, all the eggs, just like
[SPEAKER_00]: they were their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's going to be this one that is
actually a cowbird that will be taken care
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of a parasite
because this Eastern Phoebe has to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: much more work to feed another individual,
even though it's not the same species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Communalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Symbiotic relationship that benefits one
species and neither harms nor benefits the
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our example here is the clownfish and sea
anemones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clownfish gain protection by remaining
among the anemones' tentacles here,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of able to hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also immune to the
stingingness that they may produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also glean scraps from the
anemones' food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, not really harming or benefiting
either or, but these are typically seen in
[SPEAKER_00]: close proximity to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another example of that is the cattle
egrets in African Cape buffalo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So egrets eat the insects off the buffalo,
but there's no clear distinction between
[SPEAKER_00]: communalism and mutualism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Difficult to determine the second part of
benefits at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while the egret here is eating the
insects, the African Cape buffalo is not
[SPEAKER_00]: really a direct kind of benefit,
nor a direct kind of harm to that one
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of relationship may even be
parasitic in some cases, but this is just
[SPEAKER_00]: one example of communalism where in the
symbiotic relationship, we often see the
[SPEAKER_00]: buffalo, you'll see the birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The birds are benefiting by eating the
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buffalo is really neither harmed nor
benefited from this relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing here with our sea anemones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, we can occur in aquatic and
terrestrial ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just some examples of
symbiosis that does occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
