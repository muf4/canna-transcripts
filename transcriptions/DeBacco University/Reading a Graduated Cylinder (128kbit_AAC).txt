[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm going to go over reading a
graduated cylinder accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while this may seem kind of obvious,
keep in mind there can be different scales
[SPEAKER_00]: used depending on the size of the
graduated cylinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every line in every graduated cylinder
does not necessarily mean the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, it could be 0.2,
it could be 1, it could be 10 mils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be mindful of the scale of the
particular graduated cylinder you're
[SPEAKER_00]: reading at that moment in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to look closely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're looking at the cylinder,
the liquid does not create a flat line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it forms actually a U shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for water, it'll look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mercury, it'll look like this,
which odds out your prinect could be
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring mercury.
[SPEAKER_00]: This curve is called the meniscus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be familiar with that for
anatomy and physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: The meniscus is in the knee area,
knee joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the diameter and the material
used of the cylinder, this will impact the
[SPEAKER_00]: degree of that meniscus being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on how wide it may be,
you might see it to a lesser extent or a
[SPEAKER_00]: greater extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the liquid and the interaction that
liquid has with the walls of the container
[SPEAKER_00]: can also influence it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part is where you position your
eyes when you're reading that meniscus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to read the liquid on a level
surface with yourself parallel to the
[SPEAKER_00]: height of the liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want your eyes to be at the same
parallel line as the bottom of that
[SPEAKER_00]: meniscus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while the meniscus exaggerate will
look like this, you want to always,
[SPEAKER_00]: always read from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go back to the previous slide for
just one moment, it's the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's facing this way, it'd be the top
if it's facing down this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of that tangent point there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the reason why you want to have your
eyes level there is if you read the
[SPEAKER_00]: correct, that's how you get the level.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're standing too tall and looking
down, that's going to create an
[SPEAKER_00]: artificially low reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the graduate cylinder is higher
than you and you're looking up,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to give an artificially high
reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both sources for error in your measuring
technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, practice reading graduate and
cylinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would suggest each one starts with
what is the reading?
[SPEAKER_00]: You pause the video and you look at and
see what you get and then compare it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the correct answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at 18.0 milliliters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be 15, this would be 20,
15, 16, 17, 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right on the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of these is worth one milliliter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you get for reading?
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got it correct, you're looking at
36 and a half milliliters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is directly in the middle of
those two lines there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do another example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, looking here, we're looking at 42.9.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not quite on that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just below it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we get the 0.9.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this example, what's the reading?
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're looking at 61.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where someone else looked at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might get 61.1, but again, this is where
we have a little source of error.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one, because it's right on the
line, is 47.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to put that 0.0 there
because you are having that degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't want to write 47.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to write 47.0 because that shows
the degree of accuracy of the instrument
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this gives you a little
insight and a little brush up on how to
[SPEAKER_00]: read graduated cylinder properly so that
this does not become a source of error in
[SPEAKER_00]: your lab.
