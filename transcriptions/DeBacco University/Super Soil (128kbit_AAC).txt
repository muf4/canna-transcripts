[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to describe a little
bit about what this concept of super soil
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the picture here of Superman
because the idea is to create this
[SPEAKER_00]: superior soil that's really going to help
plants take off and produce maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this term super soil is very common in
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's typically used to define a
quality-based material, growing material,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is both beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungi, bacteria, micronutrients,
macronutrients, good porosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like the best of everything
for plants to grow in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a combination of recipes here to
create the ideally the best growing media
[SPEAKER_00]: for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the advantage of super soil is it
allows the growers to dial in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: type in exact nutrient ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, with great control comes great
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like the mixing table here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these little adjustments you can go
through and do that may or may not make a
[SPEAKER_00]: great impact at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that super soil allows growers to have
all of this availability and control over
[SPEAKER_00]: some very minimal conditions to very large
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making your own super soil,
well skilled growers will incorporate a
[SPEAKER_00]: precise mixture of a wide range of
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a combination of compost,
manures, and cocoa fibers, perlite,
[SPEAKER_00]: peat moss, and lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: These soils often need a cure time and can
be very labor-intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have all these ingredients at your
disposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have this entire pantry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to go through and make the
perfect dish, a perfect super soil here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and requires when you're building from
scratch all of the necessary components in
[SPEAKER_00]: very precise and pre-measured quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like putting something in the oven
that needs to bake, sometimes super soil
[SPEAKER_00]: needs time to cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And making your own super soil,
it's often a good soil-less mix will
[SPEAKER_00]: provide the base material, kind of like
the foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growers will then add some materials
too to kind of create the house,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they'll add some specialty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes what they like to think is
secret materials to kind of create the
[SPEAKER_00]: final touches here to the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This often takes a lag time in the sense
of letting it sit, letting it cure,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this entire process is very
labor-intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super soil complex recipes growers are
posted as examples all over the internet,
[SPEAKER_00]: including two links down here to take a
look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could think of creating a super soil
like a recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to look behind what makes the
best super soil, or what someone considers
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the best super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, many are based on more field
than actual science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like thinking that adding
this, and this is going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: synergistic effect, and then they're going
to add another product, and that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to give them this benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of can sometimes get out of
control based on some of the recipes that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've even seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, many of these super soil recipes are
a seller's dream because growers are
[SPEAKER_00]: buying a wide variety of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two examples, as I said, links provided
here, just so something you can take a
[SPEAKER_00]: look at what an example of a recipe or
that someone says for a super soil may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super soil recipe examples, some growers
swear by prepackaged products such as
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Frog and ProMix, and these can often
add a good base material that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: modified from there, but they take a lot
of that incorporation and building of that
[SPEAKER_00]: simple core porosity and those core
components out of the mix there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of starting with a good base
material that you can tweak or modify from
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole reason why people come up with
these super soil recipes is to have soil
[SPEAKER_00]: not to be a limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at yield, I can think
about filling up this barrel of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always going to be a lower slat
here, and that's going to be the largest
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants can get because that's the
most restrictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have good light intensity,
temperature, CO2, then this becomes of
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration of the next limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if light is up here and
temperature is maximized and CO2 is great,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, if the soil's the limiting factor,
creating a super soil will bring that up,
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing your overall yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, super soil can have a super price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recipes can get very expensive,
and in the end, products may be added that
[SPEAKER_00]: are not needed or are repeated by another
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of get this kind of diamond
ring approach where something looks nice
[SPEAKER_00]: and sparkly, but is extremely expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like planting money,
and sometimes it's often wasting money,
[SPEAKER_00]: which again is not good at increasing
yields and also increasing costs there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep yields as high as
possible with costs as low as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this begs the question, is super soil
worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: While soil is important, adding 20 plus
different amendments can be overkill,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into the time versus money thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no perfect soil or product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to focus on a few key
ingredients in having your soil balanced,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a super soil's not necessarily going
to produce a super plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: More often I see people who over-add
amendments to try to get into more
[SPEAKER_00]: problems than essentially that they have
created themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I said starting with a base
material, especially if you're a new
[SPEAKER_00]: grower, and tweaking or modifying that is
probably a great option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting completely from scratch,
maybe if you're seeing or trying to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: something very particular, that might be
worth it, but just starting off and
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, I'm going to build a whole super
soil can really cause some issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start with a good base material,
add some nutrients to it as the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: respond to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn that base material and go from
there, and then determine if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: go into developing your own recipe for
super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not recommend you starting out with
that because you can create more problems
[SPEAKER_00]: than it's worth.
