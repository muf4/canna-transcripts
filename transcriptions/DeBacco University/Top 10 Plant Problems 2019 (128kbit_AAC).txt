[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to be going over the
top 10 plant problems from the 2019
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season, even though I'm sure that
these have been seen in the past and will
[SPEAKER_00]: very likely be seen also going forward in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about disease,
we want to first talk about the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that it takes in order to get a disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a pathogen, this could be a
bacteria, a fungus, or a virus,
[SPEAKER_00]: a susceptible host, a favorable
environment, and time for all these to
[SPEAKER_00]: interact in order to get the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all three or four, if we had time,
of these factors, must come in contact
[SPEAKER_00]: with one another to get a full-blown
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So counteracting or preventing any one of
these will prevent the disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: which might seem like it's really easy,
but they can be very common and very quick
[SPEAKER_00]: to spread given the right lineup of
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we have an issue, we want to
classify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Virus, nutrient, insects, fungi,
bacteria, and the grower are all main
[SPEAKER_00]: classification areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: With viruses, it's kind of tough in plants
because they're not living, there's really
[SPEAKER_00]: no cure for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients, we tend to see occurrences
happen across a field, and they can have
[SPEAKER_00]: some very characteristic appearances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insects seem like they can happen
overnight, or in other cases, they'll only
[SPEAKER_00]: attack certain varieties we may have in a
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungi, that's one of the fungicides
because it's a major area of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacteria can be difficult to control,
not necessarily super common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Northeast, but certain years,
they definitely are more common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the grower can also be the issue,
which can be the hardest one to admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're looking here, we have blossom
end rot in tomatoes, and that's that
[SPEAKER_00]: sunken, darkened region here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also occurring on this fruit down
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is a calcium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in all these slides, I'm gonna include
these resource links.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are also in the description,
so if you go down in the description of
[SPEAKER_00]: this video, find the links to resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll also find these links, and they
were all checked after the day this video
[SPEAKER_00]: was posted to be active, so hopefully they
still are when you go to look at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, speaking particularly to calcium
deficiency, it's a rot spot that tends to
[SPEAKER_00]: start towards the blossom end,
and this can be occurring typically in
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes that are longer because that
calcium basically runs out before it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: to the end, and that's why you get the
rotten appearance down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can occur particularly in high tunnels
with a lot of irrigation events because
[SPEAKER_00]: simply we're flushing out, leaching out
some of the calcium that would be in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, getting a soil test to know if
you're low, a tissue test as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And making sure you're fertilizing with
calcium in particular if you're doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of irrigation events in high tunnels,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I list two products here and a resource
link to give you some more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, we have potassium and
magnesium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can occur both in melons and
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a zoomed in version here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium in particular, looking at the
margins, and magnesium here on the tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So speaking specifically to potassium,
okay, what to look for is browning of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't just say leaves are browning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look particularly at this tomato
leaf, this bean leaf here, the margins are
[SPEAKER_00]: what's burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing tomatoes, it can also
know sometimes yellow shoulders can be
[SPEAKER_00]: another indication of that occurring
within tomatoes, particularly again in
[SPEAKER_00]: high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when you're irrigating, you might
want to irrigate with potassium product,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly during the plant growth or at
the end of the plant growth into fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: development phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfate potassium 0050 is a very potent
source, so you don't have to use a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: it to get the necessary amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelp is often touted as being great in
potassium, but you may find it difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: to add the quantities of kelp potassium in
kelp that you may need when your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to maximum fruit load and fruit
set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple of resource links here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on to magnesium deficiency,
again in tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those lower leaves will start to get this
yellow appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This interveinal chlorosis is what you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically starts at fruit set,
and you want to monitor your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fix can be actually quite easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epsom salts starting at a rate of one
tablespoon per gallon, and that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: applied to the leaves and also as a soil
drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're using a Kalmag product,
it can be advised that you're getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium to prevent blossom end rot in
tomatoes and also some magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just keep in mind down here,
we also have a resource link for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, we have squash bug nymphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are insects, of course,
that can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you tend not to find just one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tend to find them in clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just as they're basically
hatching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is then a little bit more
advanced, but not quite at the adult
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two stages are the key points if you
want to apply a control product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our management of squash bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what to look for, they're always
large brown beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they crush them, they smell like sour
apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is actively laying eggs here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, insect netting is the only real
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray products, if you are going to apply
them, this would be the time to apply them
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're much easier to kill here
before they get this kind of armored
[SPEAKER_00]: plating to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple control products mentioned here,
as well as some resource links.
[SPEAKER_00]: Altenaria or early blight in tomatoes,
this is a very classic sign here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there might be a little magnesium
deficiency going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're focused on here is this brown
region right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost looks like you've cut down a
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see the rings of a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is classic altenaria or early blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, early blight on tomatoes,
we want to look for our small black
[SPEAKER_00]: specks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're located on the lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll start out as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it will kind of progress to this more
brown region that have rings like a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to limit soil splash and ensure
light penetration into the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, some control products and some
information here provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Verticillium on cucurbits and eggplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of looking at the brown regions,
which you might initially get confused
[SPEAKER_00]: where it looks similar to potassium
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some key factors here with
verticillium.
[SPEAKER_00]: For verticillium, what you look for is a V
burn in the leaf margins is
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some cases, verticillium will only
affect half of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those potassium would be across the
whole leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very common in eggplants,
especially if they're growing in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: area year after year.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cucurbits, the more of the entire leaf,
you don't quite get this dramatic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent it is crop rotations and
keeping an eye out for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do see it, no one can need to
rotate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it's soil-based, there's very little
you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why that in season, you want to
keep those rotations going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple of resource links provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: A resource link provided there at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf mold on tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like from the upper
portion of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like from the lower
portion of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might make a good hand model sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is looking at the comparisons of how
leaf mold looks at the top and underside
[SPEAKER_00]: of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I look for is those fuzzies,
lesions either in the top or bottom of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, typically in areas that are
protected, commonly in high tunnels and
[SPEAKER_00]: shady areas where there can be a lot of
moisture that's kind of accumulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: This disease can spread very quickly,
especially if there's high humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you first detect it, it's
recommended to kind of get a control
[SPEAKER_00]: product applied and try to maintain good
air circulation with tomatoes that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: through pruning and avoid overfeeding
plants with nitrogen because that will
[SPEAKER_00]: cause excess foliage and increase the odds
of creating those high humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple control products and also some
resource links provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, then this is spray control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So powdery mildew, we try to identify at
this stage because once we see it at this
[SPEAKER_00]: stage, it can spread very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit more common.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is typically what you'll see in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this leaf is very unique because
this girl was actually applying powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew control products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, well, they still have
powdery.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you notice in the center portion of
the leaf where that liquid is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulate and kind of run down the center
stock here, where that product had the
[SPEAKER_00]: most contact time with the leaf was
definitely preventing it from occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: These upper curled up portions of the
leaf, higher odds of getting powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: simply because there's less contact
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very important to notice that this
grower is actively spraying and they
[SPEAKER_00]: should continue because it is working
where it's coming in contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: What to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is kind of that early
detection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The early you can detect it, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to look in the shadier regions,
the underside of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the top portion of the leaf that
was shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to pull down and get in the sun
to get the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when you're looking for powdery,
it's actually wise to take your sunglasses
[SPEAKER_00]: off because the polarization of the lenses
as you turn your head can actually hide
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the smaller kind of fungus because
it's a 3D especially when it early starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If possible, you want to select resistant
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole bunch of organic and
chemical options for powdery.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of research has been done on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of resource links here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best organic approach would be 40%
milk and 60% water.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you apply that at least once a
week, that can really slow down the spread
[SPEAKER_00]: of powdery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two that look very similar are leaf mold
and powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is leaf mold on the underside.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the upper side where we're seeing
these leaf mold regions are here and here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the powdery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery tends to have that cleaner,
whiter appearance while leaf mold that
[SPEAKER_00]: more brownish kind of lesions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf mold compared to powdery.
[SPEAKER_00]: What to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that left image is those white
spots of the powdery.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yellow spots are the leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here on the right image, we're seeing that
same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white spots seem non-existent.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, powdery is occurring at the
top of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lower portions here are the brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to have something on hand
because once you see this, you want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get out and spray to control it,
to slow down its spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting on to bacterial leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomatoes and peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pepper plants, tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is characteristic of bacteria leaf
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also a bacterial leaf spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like on a larger
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts as a small little dark specks
that are typically circular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be seen on both the leaves and the
fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another concern for retail sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be varied by the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you want to prevent it is trying to
reduce soil splash, which this grower did
[SPEAKER_00]: here by putting the mulch down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see it was a very wet year and it
tends to affect that lower region first
[SPEAKER_00]: and was spreading down the whole row and
also off the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungicides will not work, so you want to
use a bacterial side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copper or oxidate or co-side are
recommended options that fall under this
[SPEAKER_00]: classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check your local laws for what can be
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a couple of resource links to help
learn a little bit more if you identify
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial speck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow vine decline, YVD.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of yellowing to the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily the vines that
yellow, so it's kind of misleading,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we kind of get this limey green
appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can start as a single plant and spread
to other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's becoming a bigger issue that is kind
of getting misdiagnosed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to come in, at least I'm
noticing, a little more common in southern
[SPEAKER_00]: New England at times of high heat,
so it's getting misdiagnosed as heat
[SPEAKER_00]: stress simply because it will cause the
actual fruit, in this case squash,
[SPEAKER_00]: to abort, which typically when we get high
heat that can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow vine decline is a little bit more
serious than that because those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: will continue to abort even after the
temperatures may cool down after a recent
[SPEAKER_00]: heat wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to control this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's nearly nothing you can do
because it is a bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to control the squash bugs
because they are the vector, so preventing
[SPEAKER_00]: or controlling squash bugs will prevent
and control yellow vine decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using insect netting would be the best
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something needs to get a little bit more
attention because I think it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, getting misdiagnosed and it's
happening in more fields than we may
[SPEAKER_00]: originally think to this point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, getting the last of the top 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't order them, didn't number them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really no exact order.
[SPEAKER_00]: These grower errors with the advantage of
high tunnels or even field growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure we're keeping
everything nice, neat, organized,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean, and easy to spot potential errors
that may be occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having irrigation set up, having things
pruned correctly, getting ready for the
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest, and being able to walk down,
being able to see down the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all key things that a grower can
be doing correctly, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the ideal situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The season extension, talking particularly
to high tunnels, you want to be sure at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the season you are cleaning
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Issues can occur, usually not just one
plant, they'll occur across the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be taking the time to scout
these and document your practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do something right or good,
you're able to document that and repeat
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something doesn't go right,
you've got to go back and see what you may
[SPEAKER_00]: have done wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to control it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's kind of a self-reflection,
kind of hope you don't get to the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, you know, swear darts pulling up
a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're able to kind of prevent problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping the structures clean is a great
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can often be overlooked, especially
in the busyness of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to reduce the potential for
disease carryover into next season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insect netting would be a great thing to
add to your high tunnels, both the vents
[SPEAKER_00]: and doorways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you limit also local pest pressure
because you're creating a nice warm
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be mindful, document what you
need, what you're doing so that it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: repeated in the case of a good season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this was helpful in the top
10 plant growing problems for 2019 season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've seen some problems you've
had in the past or going forward,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be hopefully these links and
gets you ahead to at least identify what
[SPEAKER_00]: issue you may be having so you can help
control it to reduce the reoccurrence of
[SPEAKER_00]: the spreading of the issue.
