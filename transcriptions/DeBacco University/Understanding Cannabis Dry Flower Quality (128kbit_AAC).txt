[SPEAKER_00]: Ever wondered how to assess the quality of
dry flower cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: This DeBaca University video will help you
understand this exact process.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into understanding
cannabis dry flower quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, what is dry flower
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is the product of cannabis
cultivation, typically referred to as the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry flower cannabis is the final form of
the marijuana growing process after the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has been trimmed and cut and dried
and then cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has many medical purposes due to its
relieving effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most widely popular cannabis
product as it's unique to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most consumer-based products come from dry
flower cannabis in one way or another
[SPEAKER_00]: through extraction or through the actual
sale of the actual buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how is dry flower kind of graded?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're looking at the color of it,
the trichomes, the bud structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: and overall the uniformity.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an extreme case, this would be
considered your good color, good
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes, good bud structure,
good uniformity, good quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be your lower quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see just kind of the sparseness,
the different coloration, the lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: uniformity and density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, looking at these parameters in a
little bit more detail, the color varies
[SPEAKER_00]: widely based on the cultivar and therefore
should not be the sole basis for your
[SPEAKER_00]: grading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for the trichomes, they are high
density, or that's what we're looking for,
[SPEAKER_00]: an amount of trichomes correlates to a
large amount with the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, potency does not necessarily mean
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to the actual structure of the
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A larger, denser bud structure usually
indicates higher quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing practices, which hopefully
translates to higher quality end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The uniformity, while a bud cannot be
truly uniform, the greater amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: uniformity is desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see two bugs that look very
different, but are both determined to be
[SPEAKER_00]: of high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: The colors are very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just based on the variety and
the shape very different, but we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is some degree of uniformity
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, chemically grading dry flower
cannabis, so that's kind of looking at it
[SPEAKER_00]: from a visual standpoint, and also look at
the chemical profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And testing is the best way to get a grade
of the quality of the cannabis dry flower
[SPEAKER_00]: that is required to be supplied with
customers when they demand that when
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing dry flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because this is required, this
paperwork, or at least some paperwork,
[SPEAKER_00]: should go along with any lot of dry flower
cannabis produced and available for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be your right, they don't
provide it.
[SPEAKER_00]: From where you're purchasing, you should
be able to request it and get the report.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high quality dry flowers we see here
in the pictures, vibrant orange,
[SPEAKER_00]: purple, and green colors, larger,
denser, heavier buds, thick coating of
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes, usually has a sweet floral
aroma if you're able to sample it,
[SPEAKER_00]: few stems, no signs of imperfections,
and proper trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these kind of would be examples of
this, even though this one has yet to be
[SPEAKER_00]: finally trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That low quality, kind of that comparison,
this is your lower quality, up here would
[SPEAKER_00]: be your higher quality kind of as a direct
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lower quality is usually kind of
transporting compressed bricks,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually has a darker colorations with more
browns and kind of darker deep green hues.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of stem and leaves with very leafy
appearance, dry earthy smell and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: harsh taste, tends to have a low
cannabinoid production and trichome count.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could be evident in disease or
infestation or just really poor quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing practices are really just lower
grade buds, maybe on the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also failed dry flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that when we talk about
that documentation, not every bud,
[SPEAKER_00]: not every dry flower passes inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ones that fail the inspection
and that could be for microbial analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: that could be for heavy metals,
a whole host of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the failed dry flower refers to dry
flower that has been tested, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: required, and has results that are outside
the acceptable range for whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing, as I said, includes mycotoxins,
heavy metals, biological contaminants,
[SPEAKER_00]: mold, pesticide residues, and there's
going to be many subsets under each of
[SPEAKER_00]: these categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on what the lot failed for
determines if it could be used for
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction, because usually this would
remove whatever reason why it had failed,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it can go on to that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, realize that the sale price can
be expected to be at most only 10% of what
[SPEAKER_00]: the past product would bring in,
just as a comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's very important to have
good quality growing practices,
[SPEAKER_00]: produce good quality product that ends up
passing inspection so you get a good
[SPEAKER_00]: return on your investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
