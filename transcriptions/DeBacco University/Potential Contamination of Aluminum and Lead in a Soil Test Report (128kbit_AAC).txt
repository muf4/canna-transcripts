[SPEAKER_00]: So many labs will provide you with soil
test reports of aluminum and lead,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it may not be part of
nutrients you're looking for for your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these two can be potential
contaminants, so it's a good idea to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at those numbers and to realize what harm
they can cause and what levels are
[SPEAKER_00]: considered high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this Tobacco University video will
hopefully answer some of those questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into potential contaminants
of aluminum and lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, aluminum is not an essential
plant nutrient, though it's commonly seen
[SPEAKER_00]: in some soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: High levels of aluminum in the soil can
also interfere with plant uptake of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus and may cause injury of
sensitive plant species like lettuce and
[SPEAKER_00]: beets.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soil pH decreases, the solubility of
aluminum increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an inverse relationship here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here there is our aluminum
concentration in parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our changing pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we become more acidic, we're noticing
an increase in the aluminum concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically above five parts per
million, considered toxic to tolerant
[SPEAKER_00]: species, less than two parts per million
is generally considered nontoxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see just how a simple change in
pH can really impact that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I said, pH does impact aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also be seen with plants in the
degree that they are able to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil test results often indicate elevated
aluminum levels in soil with pH levels
[SPEAKER_00]: below 5.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liming soils, which will increase the pH
to an acceptable level for the crop being
[SPEAKER_00]: grown, will typically reduce the amount of
aluminum that's available to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acid loving plants like rhododendrons,
blueberries, azaleas have high tolerance
[SPEAKER_00]: to soil aluminum levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those plants, perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, aluminum is also responsible for
the blue color of hydrangeas because of
[SPEAKER_00]: its effect on pigmentation formation,
which is why the blue flowering hydrangeas
[SPEAKER_00]: are grown in low soil pH levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're seeing just the example
that pH of 5.1 to 4.0 can have on the root
[SPEAKER_00]: development simply because of the
alteration in the availability of aluminum
[SPEAKER_00]: in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now going on to lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lead is a naturally occurring element
in soil and typically is present in soils
[SPEAKER_00]: in the range of about five to 100 parts
per million total lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil test results indicate an estimation
of the total lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always good to just have an idea and
look at that number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you determine whether or not
your lead levels are of reason of concern?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, only when total lead levels
typically exceed about 400 parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million does a U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental Protection Agency,
the EPA, list it as an element of concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the lead levels are elevated,
you should receive appropriate information
[SPEAKER_00]: about potential problems with elevated
lead levels and guarding practices to
[SPEAKER_00]: minimize exposure to lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see just a general example here
of soil lead concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, as we get above 100 parts
per billion, we should be keeping children
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the garden, do not grow root crops,
safe to grow legumes, fruiting,
[SPEAKER_00]: and leafy vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting above 400, that's bringing into a
lot more restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even at just above 100, typically want
to start to take caution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are seeing lead levels above 100,
you may want to contact the lab or see if
[SPEAKER_00]: the lab has any information about what
might be safe or not safe to grow there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the soil lead levels, and here we see
another little comparison chart here
[SPEAKER_00]: interpreting the estimation of total lead
in soils, because there's no federal
[SPEAKER_00]: standards for soil lead that has been
determined for soils where vegetables will
[SPEAKER_00]: be grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is well known that plants vary in their
uptake of soil lead, but generally lead
[SPEAKER_00]: will accumulate in leafy green tissues and
in plant roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The University of Connecticut Soil
Nutrient Analysis Laboratory strongly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommends that soils containing 400 parts
per million total lead, or greater than
[SPEAKER_00]: that number, should not be used for
growing vegetables, herbs, or other food
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, even levels under that,
there still might be reason for some
[SPEAKER_00]: concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically 100 and less, no real
precautions necessary, but as we get over
[SPEAKER_00]: 100, we start getting more and more
suggested actions and restrictions
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially on crops to grow in that
particular soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So best measurement practices for garden
soil containing lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've got a whole bunch kind of
listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you're welcome to pause the video
and take a better look at it, but
[SPEAKER_00]: generally garden should be located away
from older painted structures and heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: traveled roads because there was once lead
in the gasoline and also lead in paint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Giving planting preference for fruiting
crops like tomatoes, squash, peppers on
[SPEAKER_00]: soils with elevated lead bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remove outside leaves of green leafy
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peel the root crops and wash all
vegetables thoroughly to remove soil
[SPEAKER_00]: particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintain a soil pH of 6.5 to 7.0 by
applying limestone recommended rates
[SPEAKER_00]: because this will reduce the availability
of lead uptaken by the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we see that pH being very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintain soil organic matter between 5 and
10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic particles will bind the lead,
making it less available to plant uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, we want to be shooting for
that general 5% is just a general target.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10% is getting up there, but that can help
reduce the availability of lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintain soil phosphorus levels by
applying the recommended amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer to the garden plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus can reduce lead uptake by
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minimize dust and exposure to bare soil
through the use of mulches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wash hands thoroughly after contact of
lead contaminated soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not bring food or drinks into the area
with contaminated lead soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil on tools, gloves, shoes have elevated
lead levels also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean before storing or bringing indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless they considered raised beds or
containerized plantings in soils with
[SPEAKER_00]: elevated lead levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put the resource there at the bottom
for a fact sheet if you want to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind, knowing if your soil is
high in lead, you cannot tell by looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go through and take a soil
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's highly recommended you do in general,
but also take a look at the lead levels
[SPEAKER_00]: because that may determine what you can
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely good to know what the
nutrients and pH are and whether that soil
[SPEAKER_00]: is safe to grow whatever food crops you're
planning on.
