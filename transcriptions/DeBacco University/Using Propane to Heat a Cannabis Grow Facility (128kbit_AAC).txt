[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here on Tobacco University,
I'm going to go over using propane to heat
[SPEAKER_00]: a cannabis grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we see the propane burners here
on the stove, we'd have a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient to heat our growing area for our
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over some of the
details with using propane to heat our
[SPEAKER_00]: grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, when we're talking
propane or in natural gas heaters,
[SPEAKER_00]: just in general, they're certified for
residential agriculture as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have quiet operation from relatively
small, lightweight units.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their power exhaust options can be used in
small diameter vent pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are optional right or left-hand
piping for installation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be installed easily due to flexible
positioning of the piping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're sealed from a lubricated motor
for trouble-free dependability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some models come with a 10-year
warranty on the heat exchanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these are very positive aspects
for a reason why propane or natural gas
[SPEAKER_00]: heating for a grow facility is a very
common practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, agricultural, residential,
even industrial use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this applies more than to just the
agricultural aspect of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, propane is similar to natural gas,
but typically a little more costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we sometimes use them
interchangeably terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be kind of mindful of exactly
which one we're going to be using for our
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's typically easier to access though
than natural gas, depending on where your
[SPEAKER_00]: geographic location may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Propane offers minimal maintenance,
but a storage tank and preheater are
[SPEAKER_00]: required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Propane is best purchased by the transport
load, which requires about a 30,000 gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's usually buried, depending on
your regulations, but usually it's buried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purchase can be made during a time of the
year when prices are the lowest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be the most advantageous to the
person looking at making that purchase to
[SPEAKER_00]: be very cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, natural gas is one of the most
economical fuels that's not available to
[SPEAKER_00]: growers in all areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind that you have to
check to see if it's availability,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in your area or your
particularly growing area there to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: it is possible to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: No on-site storage is required since it's
piped in from transmission lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the reasons why it is
limited on its availability, simply
[SPEAKER_00]: because is it kind of sitting at the
street?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it below ground that you can tap into?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it something that is just not
existent in your area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural gas burns cleanly, requires little
equipment and maintenance, and used for
[SPEAKER_00]: central boilers or remote unit heaters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should not be the only heat source
for dedicated growing spaces because some
[SPEAKER_00]: suppliers includes a interoperable clause,
which allows them basically to turn off
[SPEAKER_00]: your supply in time of extreme need,
usually during cold spells when the fuel
[SPEAKER_00]: is needed to heat homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a backup fuel supply and equipment to
burn it, are essential under these
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you're an agricultural
area heating up a grow facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not necessarily high in the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to look to see if there is
that interruptible clause where if the
[SPEAKER_00]: demand is very high and the supply is low,
they can actually with their clause turn
[SPEAKER_00]: off the natural gas flow to your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: For larger users, it's best to buy a
direct purchase from one of the large
[SPEAKER_00]: suppliers near a wellhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding the transmission cost to the
pipelines will give you a total fuel cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to take into consideration
the total fuel costs there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, not every heat source is ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is great and worth consideration
if it is an option in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, consider all the pros and cons
with any heat source that you plan on
[SPEAKER_00]: using.
Thank you very much for your attention.
