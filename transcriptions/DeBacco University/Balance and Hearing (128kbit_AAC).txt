[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're going to look at the balance
in hearing sensor receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with hearing, but not from a
human standpoint, but from a fish's
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish have a lateral line, and this is
their sense of hearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to sense objects that reflect
pressure waves in low frequency
[SPEAKER_00]: vibrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This red line shows where they might be
located in this shark.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see this distinctive line here on this
fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, on this fish, the striped bass,
you might initially think there's multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: lateral lines, but there's technically
only one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look very closely at this line
here, the darker line is actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: lateral line.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fish only has one lateral line
despite many stripes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a striped bass caught in the
Connecticut River after launching from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocky Hill boat ramp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, continuing on, in fish, under their
skin, they have these canals that have
[SPEAKER_00]: sensory structures containing hair cells
projecting into a gelatinous cupula.
[SPEAKER_00]: These vibrations produce movements,
and hair cells bend and depolarize
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with sensory neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here the events of this moving back
and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see how it's all kind of attached to
all these different nerve fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how the fish is able to sense
these pressure vibrations through the
[SPEAKER_00]: movement of this cupula.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit more intensive in image here,
we see how it's kind of organized in all
[SPEAKER_00]: these different sensing outer hair cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this movement back and forth of these
low pressure waves that's being
[SPEAKER_00]: interpreted by the fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their sense of hearing without
having a distinctive ear like we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in humans, the sensation of gravity
and motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be wondering why this is located
here when we're talking about hearing and
[SPEAKER_00]: ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's very important because your
sense of balance is related to your inner
[SPEAKER_00]: ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's receptors in the ear that inform
the brain where the body is in three
[SPEAKER_00]: dimensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gravity is detected by the shifting of
otolith sensory cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are located in a gelatin-like
matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're composed of your inner ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: The force of gravity is what's causing
them to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tilt your head forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gravity is pushing them all down,
and that's your sense of where you are in
[SPEAKER_00]: three-dimensional space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your ability to walk as a youngster is
actually dependent on development of your
[SPEAKER_00]: inner ear, so you're able to sense three
dimensions so that it helps you be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain your balance, and this is the
reason why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Balance is like motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you tilt your head forward,
the force of gravity moves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Motion is detected by the deflection of
these hair cells by fluid in a direction
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite of that motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That acceleration standpoint, they're
going to go the opposite way.
[SPEAKER_00]: These hair cells are found in the cupula,
and they're tent-like assemblies in three
[SPEAKER_00]: semicircular canals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very similar structure to the fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also using sensory receptors in the hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're just using it now to detect
motion, and this is kind of related here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acceleration at rest or deceleration is
all sense of motion based on the movement
[SPEAKER_00]: of these hair cells in three-dimensional
space and your body's perception of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now properties of sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sound is simply a pressure disturbance,
altering areas of high and low pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: originating from a vibrating object.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a tuning fork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Composed of areas of refraction and
compression, represented by a sine wave
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and a wavelength, which is the
distance between two consecutive waves,
[SPEAKER_00]: either two consecutive peaks here,
or it would be two consecutive troughs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A frequency is the number of waves that
pass point per unit of time, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: amplitude here is the distance between the
origin and the crest, or it could be the
[SPEAKER_00]: origin and the trough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the amplitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: The speed is simply wavelength times
frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now frequency is the number of waves that
pass a given point at a given time,
[SPEAKER_00]: and pitch is the perception of different
frequencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hear basically from 20 to, if you're
lucky, 20,000 hertz, and it's determined
[SPEAKER_00]: by different frequencies calling different
parts of the membrane to vibrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different sensory neurons are fired,
and this is how you're able to determine
[SPEAKER_00]: different pitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now amplitude is the intensity of the
sound measured in dBs, the decibels,
[SPEAKER_00]: and loudness is subjective interpretation
of the sound intensity, relates to how
[SPEAKER_00]: often neurons fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for sound waves, wave corresponds to
pitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amplitude of the wave corresponds to the
volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sound wave shown with the dashed line
is softer in volume than the sound wave
[SPEAKER_00]: shown with the solid line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at our volume in
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you notice it's basically the same
pitch, same kind of different amplitude,
[SPEAKER_00]: same wavelength, I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our different amplitudes here,
but our wavelengths remain the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see here the kind of small talking
quiet bird.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the very angry large bird here
indicating that difference in our
[SPEAKER_00]: amplitude, even though our wavelengths are
actually remaining the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, when sound is heard,
the air vibrations detected is detected in
[SPEAKER_00]: your eardrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your eardrum is a membrane that's pushed
in and out by waves of pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's three small bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ocicles are the bones that are located on
the other side of the eardrum,
[SPEAKER_00]: an increase with the vibration force.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amplified vibration is transferred to the
fluid within the inner ear, and the inner
[SPEAKER_00]: ear chamber is shaped tightly coiled snail
shell called the acaclia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here in purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to investigate a little bit
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're transferring those sound pressure
waves to our eardrum, ultimately to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bones located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the cacula, there are hair cells
that rest on the membrane running up and
[SPEAKER_00]: down the chamber, and they're converted by
other membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cacula here in the region that's
coiled like a snail's shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sound waves entering the cacula cause the
membrane to sandwich and vibrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bent hair cells send nerve impulses to the
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like all these receptors
here, and they're basically movement is
[SPEAKER_00]: how we're able to interpret those
different pressure waves located in the
[SPEAKER_00]: air.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is found through transduction,
which are vibrations that travel up the
[SPEAKER_00]: fluid-filled interior of the cacula.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different thicknesses of the membrane
vibrate and respond to different
[SPEAKER_00]: frequencies of sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of see that evident here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's 7,000 hertz, 5,000, 4,000,
3,000, 2,000 hertz, 20,000 located right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not heard by very many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the same principle applies here
where there are hair cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the cross-section of the cacula here,
the top right figure, note that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: the addition of the upper canal and lower
canal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cacula also has a middle canal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our upper, here's our lower,
and here's our middle canal, so we're
[SPEAKER_00]: zooming in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom image is the site of the sound
actual transduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This movement of the stereocilia and hair
cells results in the action of potential
[SPEAKER_00]: that travel along the auditory nerve
that's ultimately being sent to the brain
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's how we are able to perceive
sound.
