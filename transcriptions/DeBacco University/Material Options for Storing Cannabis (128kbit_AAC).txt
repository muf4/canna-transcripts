[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've made it through a
successful growing operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had a good drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've cured all your cannabis buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're looking for storage and now
you're realizing there's a lot of material
[SPEAKER_00]: options for properly storing your cannabis
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well here at Tobacco University we're
going to give you some advantages and
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantages of some common materials so
you can make an informed decision so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can have the best long-term storage for
what you've worked so hard to grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right let's get into material options
for storing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off you want to keep the
environmental conditions optimum
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless of what material you're
actually choosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless of what material you choose,
environment is still important and those
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions are important to
monitor to help maximize the storing of
[SPEAKER_00]: your cannabis while also maintaining a
high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it can be a very high end regulated
kind of canador product here or it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: just the environmental conditions that's
being stored and does not have to be super
[SPEAKER_00]: high end can be large scale but keeping it
monitored and regulated is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are different material options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think of it like different
material options for water bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis can be properly stored in a
number of different materials and not just
[SPEAKER_00]: one correct material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each material does have its own advantages
as well as disadvantages that a grower
[SPEAKER_00]: must recognize to determine the best fit
for their given situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here in this video I am going to
provide you with a host of options as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as the advantages and disadvantages that
allow you to make that informed decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off storing cannabis in glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are typically easy to acquire and
commonly used for display as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mason jars are the industry standard but
there are other options that can be larger
[SPEAKER_00]: or smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the ball mason jars are probably the
gold standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get the lids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy new lids so you can steal up
really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to acquire these.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably considered to be probably
one of the more common options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now why is it more common option?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the glass itself is inert.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not biodegradable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes the glass material
advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: However most are clear which would require
a dark environment for storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different colors but also
present similar challenges as clear as
[SPEAKER_00]: they're still letting light in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while the material itself has a great
advantages because it is clear they should
[SPEAKER_00]: be stored in a dark environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily hard to do but something
to keep in mind if you're selecting this
[SPEAKER_00]: as your option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So others will look at what's called a
violet glass to basically store the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis buds in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Violet glass blocks visible light with the
exception of the color violet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see here lets some light in but
a lot of visible light is reflected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's semi-permeable depends on the
specific glass type as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: thickness to UVA and infrared light
allowing about 40 to 60 percent to
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind that you are getting
some degree of penetration but it is a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: less than clear glass for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the advantages of selecting this type
would be it does limit the light
[SPEAKER_00]: penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannot protect bud quality over clear
materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfalls wavelengths filtered may be
low exposure to buds anyway and this can
[SPEAKER_00]: be also difficult material to acquire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least this is storing in stainless
steel as we can see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many cooking safe containers can easily be
used for storing buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These containers offer great storage
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This material is less likely to become
damaged compared to glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's again some of the benefits and
pretty easy to acquire and easy to seal up
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reason why someone would use the
stainless steel was it is an inert
[SPEAKER_00]: material, seals the bud environment from
the outside and offers the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: block light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall is it can be heavy and they
come in limited sizes and shapes which
[SPEAKER_00]: could impact storage depending on how much
room you have for adequate storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that leads us to storing in plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis can degree in plastic
containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can often allow for easy stacking
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plastic materials can have great degree of
irritability meaning you can have plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: bags or you can have plastic buckets or
containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now storing cannabis in plastic the
advantage is that it's really easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: acquire, very easy to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bags or buckets or bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not likely to become damaged because
it is rigid.
[SPEAKER_00]: However the disadvantage is it can lead to
degradation of the buds particularly for
[SPEAKER_00]: really long-term storage which is why a
lot of growers choose not to use plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be good to be used in a pinch,
can be good for short-term operations as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep these in mind when looking at
selecting your material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can select material that's the best
fit for your situation to allow the
[SPEAKER_00]: longest storage of your buds and keep in
mind that the environment is also
[SPEAKER_00]: important as well as materials you select
actually store your buds in.
