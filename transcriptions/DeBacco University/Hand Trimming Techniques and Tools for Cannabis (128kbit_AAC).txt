[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over some hand trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques, tools and suggestions because
a lot of people get a start in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to provide you with a little bit
of background to exactly what hand
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming is and give you some tips and
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into hand trimming
techniques and tools for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, hand trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hand trimming is a process that
allows for attention to detail and for
[SPEAKER_00]: each bud to be treated in a very unique
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows the grower to best showcase
the bud through selective trimming to help
[SPEAKER_00]: the bud show its best qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you want to go through and have the
best qualities being shown?
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite this time consuming process,
the end result can bring top dollar to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the process worthwhile in the long
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, even though all these
individual people may have their own
[SPEAKER_00]: special unique kind of way of trimming,
the overall process is to kind of showcase
[SPEAKER_00]: that bud in the best way possible to,
again, so it can bring top dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do you go about this process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, step one, you want to remove the fan
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to cut away fan leaves as this
will aid in air circulation during the
[SPEAKER_00]: drying time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will also help reduce the chance of
disease developing because you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: allow allowing more air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here the fan leaves being
removed and the kind of what's remains is
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's remaining on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're seeing it stacked on a separate
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now next would be to remove the buds from
the actual branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is pertaining to dry trimming and
the buds should be removed from the
[SPEAKER_00]: branches after a few days of drying time
or a little bit longer, depending on your
[SPEAKER_00]: exact conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some length of supporting stem though
should be kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these buds will be transferred
directly to a container, ideally with
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal physical contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers will take them directly off
the plant and transfer just the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other growers will take larger branches
down and trim them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This method can be sometimes more
advantageous simply because it allows you
[SPEAKER_00]: better manipulation of that branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a little more difficult when
it's physically on the plant to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through, but if you have a smaller
operation, this would work just fine as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to fill your trimming
station.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most growers prefer a tray and some
will add a special light or magnifier to
[SPEAKER_00]: aid in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have a bud in hand, you typically
want to start at the base, basically near
[SPEAKER_00]: the stem, and remove the small branches
that may exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times they're known as crow's
feet, down this lower portion here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then proceed to remove additional plant
material around the bud with attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: detail favored over speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some trimmers will even use different
scissors at various levels of detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some use a certain set to kind of go
through and remove some of the leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: then a finer set as they get closer to
that core bud there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to go completely around the
bud at least once to ensure consistency
[SPEAKER_00]: and to inspect it, make sure you don't
forget anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: These trays are really advantageous
because they allow a great place to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of rest your arms there, and they're very
ergonomic, so they're very kind of grower
[SPEAKER_00]: friendly, because you want to make sure,
or trimmer friendly, because you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you're comfortable during this
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the equipment that you might need to
have around would be, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: scissors, comfortable sitting location,
a clean tray, indoor surface, cleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: supplies, and it's an optional light or
magnifier depending on your comfort or the
[SPEAKER_00]: room that you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at the trimming
scissors, the sharp, sterilized scissors
[SPEAKER_00]: are essential to any trimming process.
[SPEAKER_00]: While each trimmer may have their exact
preference, the goal is to get kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: these ergonomic scissors that have a
comfortable grip, and this is where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: paying more might be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some prefer kind of the encapsulated
kind of grips here, or some just prefer
[SPEAKER_00]: the straight handles, doesn't matter,
whichever you prefer is the one you should
[SPEAKER_00]: be getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to be trimming for long
periods of time, be sure to get scissors
[SPEAKER_00]: you can find that are comfortable and
comfortable to use for you, not because
[SPEAKER_00]: someone else recommended it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers get some different types of
scissors to ensure that they can have the
[SPEAKER_00]: proper tool for the different detail
pruning that bud may require.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others can go through and just use the
same set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that some might be very,
very small on the trimming end,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's great for that detail work,
but to initially remove those leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might be wiser to have a slightly
larger blade length to your scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I mentioned, comfortable sitting
location, that's comfortable for you or
[SPEAKER_00]: the person doing the trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does not have to be complex,
but should be comfortable for you or the
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting the chair and table heights
adjusted in space are very important,
[SPEAKER_00]: and depending on the exact table that
you're using or environment, that can
[SPEAKER_00]: change, but make sure, again, it's a
comfortable chair and location that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a clean tray and surface, so many
different types of trimming trays,
[SPEAKER_00]: but all have the same purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the color, as this can be your
background as you trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some may like a more stainless steel
approach, some may like a green approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's black backgrounds, white
backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep in mind that as you're trimming,
you're going to be looking at that in the
[SPEAKER_00]: background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black can be preferred as it does create
good contrast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others prefer more of a green color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just take that into
consideration if you have that option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned, cleaning supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can involve both sterilizing
agents as well as resin cleaners from the
[SPEAKER_00]: blades.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to have one of these on hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second goal is to actually use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers will just trim, trim,
trim, and then kind of as you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: later and later, it's getting harder and
harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the time, give the blades a quick
little kind of clean there, make the
[SPEAKER_00]: process easier, make your details much
sharper, and hopefully produce a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: quality end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, optional equipment would
be a light and magnifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be by grower dependent,
but some prefer to have an external light
[SPEAKER_00]: source, as this can depend on the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a very dark room,
external light source would definitely be
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a magnifier will allow the most
precise cuts to be made as the bud is
[SPEAKER_00]: being manicured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some come with this nice light and
magnifier option, which is great as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going through and trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to see it in much more
detail, particularly if you're spending
[SPEAKER_00]: long hours, as we can see here,
maybe have some coffee nearby,
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilizing equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this just shows the very basics that a
trimming station can include and ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be considering so you have a
very efficient operation as you go through
[SPEAKER_00]: and trim your final end product.
