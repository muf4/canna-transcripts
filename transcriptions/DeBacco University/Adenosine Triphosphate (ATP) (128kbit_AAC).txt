[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to investigate
adenosine triphosphate, or ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see these three letters
used quite a bit, so I figured I should
[SPEAKER_00]: help describe what this molecule actually
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I provided you with a basic picture here,
and again, it's adenosine triphosphate,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we can see the adenine, and then three
phosphate groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's look at this in a little more
detail, because it is important for
[SPEAKER_00]: cellular energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, adenosine triphosphate is a
multipurpose chemical energy storage
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's considered it powers cellular work,
and it's considered the energy currency of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at it here a little bit closer,
we have an adenine molecule, a ribose
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar, which you might remember from RNA,
both of these carbons are attached to
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen, and then three phosphate groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reason why it's three phosphate groups,
because we're talking about ATP and
[SPEAKER_00]: adenosine triphosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this shows here is the triphosphate
with all three of those phosphates.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were talking about adenosine
diphosphate, the D, there would only be
[SPEAKER_00]: two phosphates, and monophosphate,
there would only be one phosphate
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here's the image from the title
slide, and how do all these molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: differ?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, AMP, adenosine monophosphate,
has one phosphate group, and as a result,
[SPEAKER_00]: the energy from bonds is a very small
amount, and the energy stored is minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of the least energetic of the
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then go up to adenosine diphosphate,
where there's two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have more energy, and a greater amount
of energy stored in those chemical bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, we have adenosine
triphosphate, which has substantial
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of energy, and has the greatest
amount stored in its chemical bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we typically refer to ATP
being the energy currency of the cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it has the most energy,
but realize that ADP and AMP also do
[SPEAKER_00]: exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talk about this bond energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the energy is stored in chemical
bonds of molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chemical bonds are where energy is
stored, and when the bond breaks,
[SPEAKER_00]: the energy is released.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why ATP, with our three
phosphates, has the greatest amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy, because it has these high energy
bonds linking these phosphate molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see adenosine diphosphate
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we need to think about this for is
the law of electrical charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the bonding of phosphate groups to
adenine require a considerable amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think of this as the energy
required to kind of compress a spring
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the attachment of phosphate
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of each phosphate group being
another spring that's being compressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you break those bonds, you can think
of the spring here kind of letting go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This energy is released when that bond is
broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, ATP, if you have three of these
bonds together, you have that much more
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the third phosphate we're adding to ADP
would be ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with AMP.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we add one phosphate, we're going to
see diphosphate, and another phosphate
[SPEAKER_00]: group, we're going to see triphosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phosphorus is eager to get away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bond is broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great amount of energy becomes released,
energy available when ATP loses a
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we're releasing energy, we're
breaking that bond, going from ATP to ADP
[SPEAKER_00]: or ADP to AMP.
[SPEAKER_00]: AMP, adenosine monophosphate portion of
the molecules, stays the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding a third phosphate group or
phosphorylation adds energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it, I used the previous example
where we're compressing that spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Removing the phosphate group, which is
released through hydrolysis, is like
[SPEAKER_00]: freeing and uncoiling that spring,
releasing that energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, here's the ATP cycle, because I
want you to realize that it doesn't exist
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time as ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phosphate available, cell has
unlimited supply of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we're looking at phosphate groups,
as we're able to break them down here to
[SPEAKER_00]: form ADP, and attaching a phosphate group
between ATP again, we're creating and
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking those high energy bonds,
which is going to be used by this cell to
[SPEAKER_00]: perform all sorts of necessary tasks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this energy between ADP and ADP is
contained in the phosphate high energy
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphoester bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that's broken, energy is released,
and when we're attaching that phosphate
[SPEAKER_00]: group, we're creating that potential for
energy when that is broken.
