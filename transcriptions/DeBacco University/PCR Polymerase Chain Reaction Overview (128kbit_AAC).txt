[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to be going over the PCR
overview, which stands for polymerase
[SPEAKER_00]: chain reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this basically is, is a way,
an efficient way to amplify sections of
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, what is PCR?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, PCR stands for polymerase chain
reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an in vitro technique used for the
application of a region of DNA whose
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence is known or which lies between
two regions of a known sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's taking not just the whole DNA
necessarily, it's taking a small portion
[SPEAKER_00]: and amplifying that particular region of
the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does this many times and it can really
amplify exponentially the amount of DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: fragments that are produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what made this possible was one
particular key discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: This key discovery was actually occurred
in Yellowstone National Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may think about what does that have to
do with a laboratory technique used for
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology and biochemistry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a thermostable bacteria was
found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the hot springs of Yellowstone
National Park, they found a heat tolerant
[SPEAKER_00]: polymerase, which prevents denaturing and
the running of multiple cycles of this PCR
[SPEAKER_00]: site, of this PCR process at high
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the PCR requires these high
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most DNA polymerases would denature and
would lose their function.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, here, this bacteria, this hot
springs has found to have a thermally or a
[SPEAKER_00]: heat stable polymerase allowing for this
PCR process to be able to carry it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This polymerase is an isolated and is
known as now TAC polymerase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the required components for PCR
are DNA template, primers, enzymes,
[SPEAKER_00]: DTMPs, magnesium, and some buffers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these are mixed in that little
tiny tube to allow the PCR process to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through its natural sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with that DNA template.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's DNA containing a region to be
sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: The size of target DNA can be amplified up
to three kilobases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, looking at that, that the whole
DNA, we're looking at a section of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: the template of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this kind of primers that are
going to match up that to that DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: template.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these primers are going to be used to
match up with that template are usually 20
[SPEAKER_00]: to 30 nucleotides long, synthetically
produced and complement to the three prime
[SPEAKER_00]: ends of the target DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got that whole sequence of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only want a small portion of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use primers to kind of initiate that
area where that target sequence is
[SPEAKER_00]: located.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two sets of primers that are not
complementary to each other are used
[SPEAKER_00]: because remember we have those two strands
to our DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an upstream and a downstream
primer that will be utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 to 60% GC, that's guanine cytosine
content, is preferred for better annealing
[SPEAKER_00]: because those have three hydrogen bonds so
they're able to hold together a little
[SPEAKER_00]: tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature of primers can be
calculated based on the nucleotides.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a lot of G to C bonds as three,
we'll have a little higher temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's an A to T bonds, it'll have two
hydrogen bonds, a little less temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: These would be outlined in a protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that Taq polymerase that I mentioned,
it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this Taq polymerase or really any
one of the natural or recombined
[SPEAKER_00]: thermostable polymerases need to be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stable at temperatures up to 95
degrees Celsius and Taq polymerase does
[SPEAKER_00]: not have proofreading, which is one
downfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not looking at really
replicating these DNAs to be utilized in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at them to be used to be run
in, for example, gel electrophoresis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the PCR cycle is a cycle and it does
repeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's comprised of three steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the denaturation step where we
increase in temperature to about 95
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That causes our double-stranded DNA to
kind of separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the primer hybridization
where we cool the temperature down a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit to anneal those primers,
get those primers to stick on to those
[SPEAKER_00]: since separated DNA sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the DNA synthesis primer
extension where we're kind of going
[SPEAKER_00]: through, we heat it back up to speed up
the process and we have those DNA sections
[SPEAKER_00]: extended and then replicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll go through a repeat of this
process again and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that first part that I mentioned,
the denature of the template strain DNA by
[SPEAKER_00]: heat and 95 degrees, it's taking our
double-stranded DNA, heating up so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: denatured so it's being separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be 90 to 95 degrees Celsius
depending on the specific region,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the A to T bonds or G to C
bonds presence and the percentage of
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the temperature is then
lowered and the primers are annealed to
[SPEAKER_00]: the target sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we get the temperature at 95,
everything we bouncing around so quick,
[SPEAKER_00]: those primers would not be able to anneal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we cool it down a 45 to 60 degrees
Celsius to give a chance for those primers
[SPEAKER_00]: to stick on to the initial starting point
of this target DNA sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why there's a range of
temperatures, again, it depends on how
[SPEAKER_00]: many, what percentage of G and C bonds
that may be present or A and T bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step three, at 72 degrees Celsius,
the TAC DNA polymerase catalyzes the
[SPEAKER_00]: primer extension as complementary
nucleotides are incorporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we heat up to approximately 72 degrees
Celsius and this allows these nucleotides,
[SPEAKER_00]: this polymerase to go through and attach
these nucleotides to now make two new
[SPEAKER_00]: double-stranded sections of DNA over that
target sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the end of the first cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the end result is two copies of the
target DNA sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like a lot of work to go through
this, that one little cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, once we go through the second and
the third, the fourth and the fifth,
[SPEAKER_00]: this increase becomes exponential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we typically rarely do see a PCR run
for more than 30 to 40 cycles because you
[SPEAKER_00]: have literally millions of copies of DNA
at that stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this target amplification, as I
mentioned, this is an exponential
[SPEAKER_00]: amplification in DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's our first cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then each one of those are separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get four copies and we go to eight to
16 to 32 to so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 40 cycles, if you reach that number of
cycles, you can get about a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: billion copies from just ideally one
original template strand of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of that standard
thermocycle, as I said, 94, 95 degrees to
[SPEAKER_00]: denature, only about 45 seconds at that
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we cool it down for about another 45
seconds to allow those primers to anneal,
[SPEAKER_00]: heat it up to 72 degrees Celsius for
about, again, under a minute, let
[SPEAKER_00]: extension phase to occur and then repeat
and repeat and repeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the very end, it will chill down to
four degrees Celsius and hold there until
[SPEAKER_00]: you go through and pull your samples out
of the thermocycler.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, this is an exponential
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to give you an idea of these PCR
cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows the temperature fluctuations
that do occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of gives you a visual
representation of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows you the number of PCR cycles,
the number of target copies of that DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: template that are made.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see initially we go two to four to
eight to 16 and dramatically will increase
[SPEAKER_00]: and we go to 30 cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you could see just exponentially how
many more cycles or based on those cycles,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many more DNA sequences we are able to
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is great when we have a lot of
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think, why would you want that many
samples?
[SPEAKER_00]: What really makes it easy for the next
step, which is gel electrophoresis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the sequence of using those
amplified fragments run through a gel and
[SPEAKER_00]: then going through the southern blot
process to be able to visualize those for
[SPEAKER_00]: comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's PCR amplification.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genome mapping and gene function is
determination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biodiversity studies that can be used for
evolutionary studies, diagnostics,
[SPEAKER_00]: parental testing, genetic diseases,
early detection of cancer, viral
[SPEAKER_00]: infections, many things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Detection for drug resistance,
forensics DNA can be used for DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: fingerprinting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that this same basic
process can be used for many potential
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general advantages of PCR that's
automated, it's fast, it's reliable,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's reproducible results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you purchase the machine,
which can get expensive, it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: self-contained and you basically can set
all everything up, dial everything in and
[SPEAKER_00]: basically walk away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also very contained.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used on a lab bench.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's less chance for contamination to
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very high output, sensitive,
it's broad use, defined and easy to follow
[SPEAKER_00]: protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're starting in a microbiology type
lab, if you're starting in kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: genomics lab, odds are you're going to be
running some form of PCR because of all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these advantages, it does become very
widely used and is very much an accepted
[SPEAKER_00]: and a good protocol to learn to be able to
perform.
