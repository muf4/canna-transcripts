[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to be looking at
types of population pyramids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of gives you just a general
overview here of rapidly expanding
[SPEAKER_00]: population pyramid and expanding,
stationary, and a contracting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also how they look here in a
little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is the general shape,
and this is how they look when we break
[SPEAKER_00]: them out per age group here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at some of these
examples, but this is a good kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: reference slide to be able to understand
the different types of population pyramids
[SPEAKER_00]: that do exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, population pyramid is the total
population divided into about five year
[SPEAKER_00]: age groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: The percentage of people in each of those
age groups is presented, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of males and females in each
age group is shown in a very clean and
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctive manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shape of the pyramids is controlled by
the rate of birth, the rate of deaths,
[SPEAKER_00]: or migration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this kind of shows just those
examples again of expanding, stationary,
[SPEAKER_00]: and contracting populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evidence of expanding, or high birth rate,
rapid fall in each upward age group due to
[SPEAKER_00]: high death rates here with a very short
life expectancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at some of these in
more detail with some countries as
[SPEAKER_00]: specific examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, let's look at the general
shapes that we're going to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, an expanding shape is going to have
this kind of triangular appearance here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stationary is going to be kind of a box
shape, and negative contracting is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a triangle, with a point in the
downward direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be contracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be expanding in contrast to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this population pyramid,
what does this kind of look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's take a look at this one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a mock example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the males here on the left,
females here on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the age groups here down the
middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have our populations broken out
into millions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be 13 million, 26, 39,
52, and 65 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be for males and females.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have three little subsets here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This age group of 60 and older is
considered elderly dependents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have our working population,
which is about age 15 to age 59.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have our young dependents
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the young ones that are too
young to start working, the main core
[SPEAKER_00]: working population, and then the elderly
dependents that are depending on that
[SPEAKER_00]: working kind of population there for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now population's age structure and sex
ratio can be used to assess its
[SPEAKER_00]: demographic trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we see here with Christmas Island over
here, we see large portion of males
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to females, in particular a very
large population in the males of the age
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 to 29.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives us an idea of the
demographics of this particular island.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that very evident here with this
population pyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now triangle shaped pyramid, the expanding
pyramid, this is Kenya here expanded.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see very large base, and we see a
very small kind of up towards the top
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growth rates are slow, with a very short
life expectancy sadly in this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: This expanding pyramid shape is broad
based with high birth rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Narrow top, so there's a small elderly
population, which means there's a high
[SPEAKER_00]: death rate sadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proportion, there's a large portion of
young people, and it's a high young
[SPEAKER_00]: dependency ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sex ratio in this balanced pyramid,
there's a balanced sex ratio from males to
[SPEAKER_00]: females.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not favoring any one particular
gender.
[SPEAKER_00]: An expanding pyramid in contrast to that,
see expanding pyramid is expansive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This population pyramids have the classic
triangular shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's a little bit different than the
previous one that we saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a wide base like we saw at the
other one, which indicates a high birth
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a narrow top indicates a high death
rate, but we see there's deeper into the
[SPEAKER_00]: population here with a greater population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally speaking, an expanding
population is characteristics of low
[SPEAKER_00]: standards of living.
[SPEAKER_00]: High birth rate due to poor access to
birth control, lack of education,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a high death rate due to poor medical
care or potentially nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here with Syria and Haiti.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see a large population of kind of
that 29 and under, but then it decreases
[SPEAKER_00]: rapidly as that population, individuals
within that population age.
[SPEAKER_00]: A negative growth pyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is a shrinking population.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a long life expectancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Italy here, we see this negative
growth, meaning there's not as many young
[SPEAKER_00]: people as there are that working class as
they progress older.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Greece, we see the same negative growth
pyramid, and that's evident by the narrow
[SPEAKER_00]: base that occurs, which shows a low birth
rate, which is a decrease in population.
[SPEAKER_00]: A large portion of the working population,
that 15 to 59 year old, see that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of that population there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sex ratio again is a balanced
pyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an equal balance between
females and males in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: A negative growth pyramid would be evident
of Italy, or in this case, Greece.
[SPEAKER_00]: This negative growth population is a
population pyramid have narrower base than
[SPEAKER_00]: the reproductive age population.
[SPEAKER_00]: This indicates a decreasing population
trend, and the low birth rate is
[SPEAKER_00]: indicative of a well-developed country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as we saw with Italy and Greece,
we see the same thing going on here with
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, male to female ratio is also pretty
equal, but this is a negative growth
[SPEAKER_00]: population pyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a stable pyramid has low infant
mortality, a slow population growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a long life expectancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say it's stable, it's pretty much
consistent throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's not going to be consistent the
whole way we have to keep in mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: is just based on normal human activity,
people are not going to live to be 100
[SPEAKER_00]: plus, the same portion of the population
as is going to be the age 50 to 54.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be a natural
progression downward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see pretty much from age 65 to 69 here,
all the way down the base of being born,
[SPEAKER_00]: a pretty stable population overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a rectangular shape or zero
population growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a narrow base, so there's low birth
rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The life expectancy is high in these
stable populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about 80 plus years is the
expected life expectancy, low death rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a stable population,
bars of equal length, and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: balanced proportion here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, sex ratio is also balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we may see that in this case,
in Denmark, age 30 to 34 is a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: less, but overall, we're kind of looking
at general trends here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the stable population pyramids have a
base similar to the width of the
[SPEAKER_00]: population of the reproductive ages,
which indicates a stable population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally speaking, these stable
populations, and we see example here
[SPEAKER_00]: Aruba, are characteristics of a high
standard of living.
[SPEAKER_00]: This high standard of living is due to low
birth rate, due to good family planning
[SPEAKER_00]: and access to birth control, financial
planning, and education overall in the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a low death rate due to good medical
care, nutrition, and education.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said before, we can't have it a
complete box, but life expectancy of about
[SPEAKER_00]: 80 years old, or in this case,
over 70, is just indicative of good stable
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we see the balance or sex ratio
between males and females varying equal,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Aruba here, 2015, is showing a prime
example of a stable population pyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
