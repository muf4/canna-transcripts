[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this video lecture is in meiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest you watch the other one that I
have on mitosis first, because a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these same steps repeat and use the same
terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with meiosis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we're talking about meiosis,
we want to be mindful of comparing it to
[SPEAKER_00]: mitosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to see these comparisons
done quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitosis is starting with this diploid
cell, which is a normal cell in your body,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's making two identical copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meiosis here, we're taking that same
initial start to the cell, and we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to end up with actually four cells in the
end that each have half of the total
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do another comparison here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we see our parent cell, we have this
replication phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that replication phase,
we can go to mitosis, which you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: here is forming two identical copies of
the parent cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or meiosis here, we're forming four total
cells, each with half of the total genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, some of the terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sister chromatids is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This refers to either of the two identical
copies, chromatids, formed by replication
[SPEAKER_00]: from a single chromosome, with both copies
joined together with this centromere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our chromosome here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our centromere is at center
location, also represented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our sister chromatids are those two
things, two chromosomes, joined together
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's centromere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Together these make the sister chromatid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's also something called daughter
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these are paired chromatids,
or sister chromatids, eventually separate,
[SPEAKER_00]: keyword here separate, and become daughter
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of mitosis, daughter
chromosomes are properly spaced out and
[SPEAKER_00]: allocated to the different two daughter
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Together, they're sister chromatids,
forming a chromosome, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: represented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or separated, they're daughter
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know this just sounds a little
confusing, the difference between daughter
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes and sister chromatids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part here, the sister chromatids
are actually joined, and the daughter
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes are separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting into what's the purpose of
meiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for sexual reproduction,
and for plants, seed formation,
[SPEAKER_00]: is basically to get to the next
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spreading out the genes to then produce
either, in this case, it'd be pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: grains, it could be forming interseeds,
to be able to make a new plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a new person in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first we have to understand two key
terms here.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one is somatic cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are any cell in a living organism
that is not a reproductive cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have an endoderm line,
a mesoderm line, an ectoderm line,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the somatic cells, they go through and
they can form these stem cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're forming lung tissue,
the pancreas, the heart, or red blood
[SPEAKER_00]: cells, skin, or neurons, all these are
somatic cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are also diploid, meaning they
contain two sets of chromosomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: one from each parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one from mom, one from dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: If these were plant cells, it could be
leaves, and roots, and shoots,
[SPEAKER_00]: and stems, and they would also have one
chromosome from the male plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one chromosome from the female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about gametes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are single cells produced by adult
organisms that are specialized for mating,
[SPEAKER_00]: and only have half the number of
chromosomes, and thus we call them
[SPEAKER_00]: haploids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a single set of unpaired
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to form a zygote, we need a sperm cell
and an egg cell to come together,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is the first cell of a new
individual, this zygote here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see the ovules in a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see pollen grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: If these two come together, that's forming
a fruit here, and these, in example,
[SPEAKER_00]: would be tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking a little bit closer at comparing
the two, haploid is usually represented
[SPEAKER_00]: with just the letter N, and diploid is 2N.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haploid sperm fertilizes a haploid egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resulting diploid zygote receives one
copy of each gene from mother and one from
[SPEAKER_00]: father.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see the example here,
a haploid egg and a haploid sperm come
[SPEAKER_00]: together to form the diploid zygote.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the start of the new individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing here, haploid sperm,
haploid egg, forming a new individual
[SPEAKER_00]: also, and this is diploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: One copy from mom, one copy from dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are two divisions of meiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: One cell divides into two, and then each
of those divide again, resulting in four
[SPEAKER_00]: total cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unlike mitosis, where we were forming
two identical copies, here we're forming
[SPEAKER_00]: four unique cells through very similar
phases, prophase, metaphase, anaphase,
[SPEAKER_00]: and telophase one, and then the same thing
repeats, prophase, metaphase, anaphase,
[SPEAKER_00]: and telophase, all represented in two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go into these in a little bit more
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with prophase one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chromosomes coil become shorter and
thicker, nuclear envelope and nucleolus
[SPEAKER_00]: dissociate to break apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chromatids can be seen, centromeres form
and have microtubules attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of similar to prophase in mitosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing that condensing here of the
chromosomes, we could see our centrioles
[SPEAKER_00]: developing, the chromosomes are
condensing, the nucleolus breaking down,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this term crossing over is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: During prophase one, crossing over can
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very important thing that
happens in prophase one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a process where homologous
chromosomes pair up with each other and
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange different segments of their
genetic material to form recombinant
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have homologous chromosomes and
these could just be the same chromosome,
[SPEAKER_00]: one for example, and they line up next to
one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's crossing over is because these are
homologous, meaning they essentially code
[SPEAKER_00]: for the same thing, one could be from mom,
one could be from dad, crossing over,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning a section could break off this
chromosome and rejoin here, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: what we call crossing over, because a
piece is crossing over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a white and a black
chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we get crossing over, and we see we
get a kind of a striped appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a white and a black, and a white
and a black and a white and a black.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is crossing over, meaning these were
unique genetics separated out,
[SPEAKER_00]: now they're kind of joined together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important because it happens on
metaphase, the chromosomes align at the
[SPEAKER_00]: equator and spindle fibers become
apparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metaphase, remember they're lining up that
metaphase plate, that equator of the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: here is lining up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, this is metaphase one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it looks like on a real-world
image here, you can see everything aligns
[SPEAKER_00]: up distinctly through the dye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anaphase one is chromosomes migrate to the
poles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're getting the pulling part of
our chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the centromeres are not broken here,
that's an important aspect to keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are still attached, the centromeres
are still attached, but now if we got this
[SPEAKER_00]: one from mom and this one from dad,
these get pulled apart, here we notice a
[SPEAKER_00]: little crossing over did occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anaphase looks like that, pulling the
part of those chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Telophase one and cytokinesis,
this is a weak formation of the nucleus,
[SPEAKER_00]: because remember they're going to divide
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see, initially we're starting to have
a nucleus starting to form, but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to slowly divide and break apart
more here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So division two, similar but not the exact
same process repeats, so be careful and
[SPEAKER_00]: mindful what's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in prophase two, chromosomes
become shorter, they never really
[SPEAKER_00]: completely dissociated, but they become
shorter and more condensed, spindle fibers
[SPEAKER_00]: are forming, here in metaphase two they're
lining up again, and an important part
[SPEAKER_00]: here, between metaphase one and metaphase
two, if you look at these images,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's three here, this one and this one
look very similar, this one looks
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice here we're going to get
separation at the centromere, here we're
[SPEAKER_00]: just going to migrate the chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice this is evident in metaphase
two, same with this one, this is metaphase
[SPEAKER_00]: one, the centromeres will not be broken in
metaphase one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, metaphase two here, a little bit
harder to see on some of these stained
[SPEAKER_00]: images, but we get the sense for what that
looks like, everything kind of lined up on
[SPEAKER_00]: the equator region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anaphase two, same thing happens,
our chromatids separate, allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes to migrate to the poles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Important for anaphase two, we're actually
breaking those centromeres, and those are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually migrating to the poles here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Telophase two and cytokinesis,
the chromosomes become longer,
[SPEAKER_00]: new nuclear envelope develops,
and nucleoli reappear, new cell walls
[SPEAKER_00]: develop between each of the four groups of
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nuclear envelope forms around each set of
chromosomes, and the cytoplasm divides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see we're getting four distinct
cells that are forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meiosis stage one and meiosis stage two,
you can see kind of the comparison here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the key part here with meiosis,
we're ending up with four cells in the
[SPEAKER_00]: end, each with half of the total genetic
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to kind of give you a little bit of an
animation of what's generally occurring,
[SPEAKER_00]: notice everything lines up, we are just
pulling them apart, nothing was broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting our formation, and this is for a
single egg cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll talk about when we get to human
development, egg cells are only
[SPEAKER_00]: technically one total mature true egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can kind of see and replay this
again, what's going on, how things are
[SPEAKER_00]: migrating, what is, these are just moving
across, no centromeres broken,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then when they do get broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polar bodies, we'll talk about that when
we do human reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can hear the centromeres are
actually being broken, and for the
[SPEAKER_00]: formation of eggs, a single egg,
there's only one true egg that's formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, important and a good quiz question
between mitosis and meiosis, here's a
[SPEAKER_00]: great comparison between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mitosis, again, forming those two total
cells, meiosis forming those four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, being able to compare and contrast
these two is an important aspect to show
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want a couple more links to
some videos, here is a couple that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: provided to you.
Thank you.
