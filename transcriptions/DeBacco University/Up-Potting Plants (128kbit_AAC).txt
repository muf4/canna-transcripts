[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we can see a plant that's been
up-potted or transplanted several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the original plug that it
started in, then the larger container it
[SPEAKER_00]: went to, and its current container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these stages help kind of
maximize the space that a grower can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in, minimize the amount of lights,
and help the efficiency not only of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, but the growing operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transplanting, oftentimes plants will be
transplanted during the vegetative phase
[SPEAKER_00]: to encourage top growth and also to
maximize a growing space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of times that this is done is
transplanting action, and what size
[SPEAKER_00]: containers that are selected are mainly
grower-dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no set gallon amount or size
amount that you must go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, of course, the trend is
increasing, but what size you use as
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum is slightly grower-dependent,
most using seven or 10 gallon pots for
[SPEAKER_00]: their larger size, some as small as five,
and some as large as 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be mindful when you're
transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to harden off your
transplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are transplanting and changing the
lighting at the same time, be sure to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow time for the plants to transition to
reduce the chance of damaging those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be careful and mindful of leaf
burn, because this can be a sign that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're pushing that growth on that kind of
ragged edge there of really doing severe
[SPEAKER_00]: damage to the plants while you're trying
to help them out with the transplant
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be accomplished by sometimes
taking lights and hanging them further
[SPEAKER_00]: away to reduce the intensity, which is
great for growers because it can also
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the lighting footprint during the
vegetative stage of growth.
