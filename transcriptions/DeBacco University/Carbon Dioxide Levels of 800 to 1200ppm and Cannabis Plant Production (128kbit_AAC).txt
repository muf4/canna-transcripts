[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this tobacco university video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be looking at carbon dioxide levels
of 800 to 1200 parts per million in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at elevating your grow area to 800
to 1200 parts per million, let's look and
[SPEAKER_00]: see how it relate to cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, CO2 levels in that range,
while 400 parts per million is considered
[SPEAKER_00]: normal atmospheric conditions,
elevating levels above this will require
[SPEAKER_00]: the use of several pieces of a equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to increase the overall plant
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of see here, effective
carbon dioxide and net photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Realize though, it's not a linear
progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is kind of, it levels off, it kind of
plateaus at a certain air level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the equipment list, you're going to
need a source of carbon dioxide,
[SPEAKER_00]: a method to deliver that, a system to
monitor the carbon dioxide levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind the options I've
discussed in other videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: This video focuses on the chosen range and
its impact on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the image right here shows if you were
to use a bottle system, but there are
[SPEAKER_00]: other options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the 800 to 1200 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this level will allow growers to
justify using lights with high outputs,
[SPEAKER_00]: despite the increase in initial and
operating costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will allow for plants to pack on more
biomass in a shorter period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note, this may require an adjustment when
you flip your plants from veg to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants will also require greater
fertilizer to meet their aggressive
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this added cost needs to also be taken
into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here just a general par guy looking
at when carbon dioxide would be required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can also see different light levels at
different distances between the plant or
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf canopy to the light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would you select this particular
range?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this allows plants to maximize
highlight intensities.
[SPEAKER_00]: These levels have shown to maximize the
photosynthetic rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants can tolerate elevated temperatures,
86 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply put, because the Robisco enzyme,
which is a very crucial part to the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic process, it's an enzyme and
it can operate at greater efficiencies
[SPEAKER_00]: with carbon dioxide levels in this range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why plants are able to tolerate
those warmer temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, like most biological systems,
there is a theoretical maximum,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is the optimum rate for the
enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adding more will not improve the rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may actually have negative impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it shifts a little bit warmer,
you don't want to go much warmer than 90
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very important if you're growing
an auto flower to the fixed number of days
[SPEAKER_00]: from emergence to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers should be maximizing each and
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one highly recommended method
to be able to accomplish this with auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers that will produce a yield in a set
number of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can help growers maximize each and
every day that you have within that fixed
[SPEAKER_00]: time span.
