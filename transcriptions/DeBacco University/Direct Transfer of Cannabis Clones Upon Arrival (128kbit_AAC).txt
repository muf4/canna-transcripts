[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go over directly transferring
your Canvas clones upon arrival to both
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors, we see the image here,
as well as the indoor situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now that you've got those
clones, let's go through the transfer
[SPEAKER_00]: process once they arrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, when clones first arrive,
you want to be sure to inspect the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they're in good condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in good shape and can handle any
transfer stress that they'll be going
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can be a very efficient method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, you're inspecting the tops of
the plants, as well as pulling a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: samples out and also inspecting the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be fearful if some of the lower
leaves are kind of yellow or off in
[SPEAKER_00]: coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can simply be because if they were
packaged or grown together really closely,
[SPEAKER_00]: they might be getting enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a good root structure and a good top
growing point are all good things
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating that those clones will be able
to survive the transfer process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And grow into full size plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure the clones,
again, have those quality roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're looking at quality roots,
if the roots are not fully developed,
[SPEAKER_00]: this would be a reason to potentially hold
off directly transferring your clones to
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have only a couple roots coming
out or roots that are kind of weakly
[SPEAKER_00]: established, might want to hold on to them
on an indoor environment before you go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and transfer them to the outdoor
environment or hold them in a propagation
[SPEAKER_00]: environment before they go into a
vegetative stage of a grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a little bit more stress
for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hopefully ease that transition,
get them ready before they make that jump
[SPEAKER_00]: to the next stage of development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we're growing outdoors,
weather can influence how the direct
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer is or when you go about that
direct transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, transitioning plants from the initial
arrival to an outdoor growing location may
[SPEAKER_00]: be best on a cool and cloudy day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help reduce the overall stress
of the initial planting day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I was looking at this kind of
weather forecast, looking at right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see some rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be good for an outdoor location.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to get the ground saturated,
a couple days of drying and warming up
[SPEAKER_00]: that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these partly cloudy days would be
great days to transfer it, followed by
[SPEAKER_00]: showers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help ease that transition of
your newly arrived clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all part of the process of
easing that transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some color changes when you make
that transfer, both outdoors or indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stems may even turn purple, indicating
initial transplant stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But especially if planting in an outdoor
environment, don't take this into a major
[SPEAKER_00]: reason for concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are just making that
adjustment to your growing environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times that purple coloration will
go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will start to establish
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will all be just a history in the
past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're in an indoor location,
it's a little bit easier because you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to watch the initial light intensities to
reduce the chance of burning your tender
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a lot more control over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights are not dimmable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply putting the shade netting between
the plants and the lights can work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thin little sheet can help reduce the
chance of leaf damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you have a taller grow tent,
you can bring the lights up so they're
[SPEAKER_00]: further away as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep any materials closer to the plants
and the lights to avoid the chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you're looking at putting
shade netting, you don't want to drape it
[SPEAKER_00]: over your lighting structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to put it just above or support
it just above your plants to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of anything catching on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a nice safe growing
environment for both the plants as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and surrounding environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
