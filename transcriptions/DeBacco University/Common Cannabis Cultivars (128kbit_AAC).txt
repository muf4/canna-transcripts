[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here I'm going to go over some
common cannabis cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cultivars, we call them strains,
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivar is probably the best term to use
as it's botanically correct because there
[SPEAKER_00]: are some great variability, and you can
see here just the morphology of these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, but there's other differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So general cultivar overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, while some highlights are provided
in some cases, little is known about the
[SPEAKER_00]: origin of some of the cultivars I'm even
going to present here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows the lack of definable,
traceable, family trees, which is why
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporating genetic testing is so
important going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here on some very commonly
varieties, there's not a lot of great
[SPEAKER_00]: background information on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind also that the use of the term
cultivar has a relatively new concept to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, but it's botanically correct
method and should be used at increased
[SPEAKER_00]: rates of adoption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's so many to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: More breeders are not only exchanging
plant materials, such as clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: but sharing what they produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: This increases the diversity of plants
available, and part of the challenge is to
[SPEAKER_00]: have an accurate lineage record so we know
where these plants came from or what
[SPEAKER_00]: resulting cross they may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So general classifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see our THC group and our CBD
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get to the CBD group and
explain a little bit of kind of some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the issues with some of these varieties
and the THC group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I provide some links to offer some
other information to kind of get some
[SPEAKER_00]: background on these in addition to what I
provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, THC varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are strains that produce a
psychoactive high income associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: These that are high in THC are not the
main focus of this class.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to focus in again on that CBD
and hemp varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's common variety names that
you may recognize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to realize what is actually
classified as marijuana and what is more
[SPEAKER_00]: of the hemp variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sage Sativa afghan genetic equilibrium
is a high THC variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Created by Adam Dunn is considered to be
the main staple of TH seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains over 20% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very potent strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's S.A.G.E, not sage as in the
herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Placed second in the 2001 cannabis cup and
more information presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the sage plant in a kind of
relating to a herb would look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not quite too similar to the sage in the
cannabis variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's again, different derivative of
that name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Dream origin in California,
even though the exact creator is unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get into this variety too,
which again, high THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to focus on it in general,
but I just want you to realize here we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know the exact creator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has become a West Coast legend and we
still don't even know who created it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Known for potency and high production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour Diesel established itself in the
cannabis scene in the early 90s with
[SPEAKER_00]: increased interest on the East Coast in
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States, the name originated
by a grower who had a sour demeanor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has nothing to do with this taste of the
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, sometimes these names can be
misleading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, even though this is in the
marijuana classification, Sour Diesel,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's because the person was a sour person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pungent odor when growing typically
produces THC levels well above 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple Haze, buds of shades of lavender,
which is part of the name derived comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Known for high energy, creative,
and blissful effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made popular in 1967 by Jimi Hendrix with
the song Purple Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, it does have this kind of purple
coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: These anthocyanins are much higher in
Purple Haze and also THC is high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush, OG Kush is one of the most popular
and potent strains in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a broad category, but in general,
you can expect Kush to have usually dense
[SPEAKER_00]: buds, rust colored pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here that kind of brown
coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lemon fuel skunk and kind of spicy
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smooth herbaceous flavor and sedative
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, also high in THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl Scout Cookie or being abbreviated now
GSC, short for Girl Scout Cookie,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a hybrid across between OG Kush
and Durban Poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little is known about the origin other
than it started in California fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: recently, 2011, 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this just points to the fact
that these names that become very popular,
[SPEAKER_00]: little is known about their origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is increasingly kind of unknown in
the variability that we have even with
[SPEAKER_00]: some well established, well accepted
variety names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, then we get to ones that are low in
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: These low THC cultivars are ones that will
not get you high.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't produce very high amounts of
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to get you in that
psychoactive high.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be considered low in THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often this is considered to be below 5%
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind, in order to be
classified as hemp, the levels need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: less than 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some are arguing that federal maximum
level of THC should be around 1% as this
[SPEAKER_00]: will provide more cultivars to be used
medically and still not produce the
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have the picture of the limos here
simply because we're looking at where is
[SPEAKER_00]: that bar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where should that bar be placed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now it's 0.3%, very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's limiting the amount of
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: These next varieties I'm going to show are
low in THC, meaning they're below usually
[SPEAKER_00]: around about that 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are not acceptable from the federal
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would still be classified as marijuana
under the current law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kinetonic, while it's high in CBD,
again this is the medical benefits,
[SPEAKER_00]: 6% to 17%, there is still enough THC not
to be considered as cultivar as hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically has around that 6% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's still a highly regarded
medical cultivar and has been used to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat pain and anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, still above that federal level,
well above that federal level,
[SPEAKER_00]: despite its high CBD production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at ACDC and this
cultivar is derived actually from
[SPEAKER_00]: kinetonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a ratio of THC to CBD of about 1 to
25.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's typically around half to 1.2% THC,
which is still very low, but again still
[SPEAKER_00]: above that federal limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This unique ratio induces little to no
intoxicating effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can still have the CBD percentage
around 16 to 24%.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, typically test just above that
threshold for what's defined as hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's being replaced by Charlotte's Web.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, ACDC, we have the band,
we have ACDC and types of power
[SPEAKER_00]: conversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also have some great links located below
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's CBD varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp are high CBD and low THC,
which is low THC is defined as less than
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.3% THC, are the main focus of this
class.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there are many different varieties,
I've chosen to highlight really just a
[SPEAKER_00]: few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wife and abacus are two examples of
varieties being grown at UConn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see medical marijuana that we tried
to slash through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a misleading statement
because marijuana is an indicating of that
[SPEAKER_00]: high THC strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're focusing here on CBD and hemp
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Charlotte's Web is probably the one
that gets the most attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's biggest selling point is that it's
classified as hemp since it is less than
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.3% THC and also still remains high in
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been shown to reduce seizures
without any mental side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its name is actually derived from a young
girl whose name is Charlotte who was
[SPEAKER_00]: having epileptic seizures and that were
reduced with this cultivar, which has a
[SPEAKER_00]: web-like appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Charlotte's Web, that's where it comes
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a relatively rare cultivar,
but it's highly sought after in the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical community leading to increased
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have some great links here to the
article about it and some more information
[SPEAKER_00]: about Charlotte's Web if you want to learn
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a variety here we're growing at UConn
is entitled Wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a high CBD cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's high in CBD to THC ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the exact genetics actually though do
still remain mainly unknown as far as the
[SPEAKER_00]: lineage that it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used for chronic pain and
dealing with negative effects from
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, this is one of the varieties
being grown here at UConn.
