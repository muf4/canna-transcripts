[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this Tobacco University video,
we're going to go over some mathematical
[SPEAKER_00]: equations so you know how to adjust your
organic matter and not just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: eyeballing it where you could add way too
much or if you're looking at purchasing
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you might not purchase enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into adjusting
organic matter in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as I said, this will be a math kind of
based kind of approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're suggested to maybe let me go
through it once, pause it for yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then go back over the information
there to apply your own information to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, when we're adjusting organic
matter in soil, we want to know the
[SPEAKER_00]: present organic matter percentage in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organic matter percentage in the
organic amenant will be adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, I'm going to use peat moss
as an example as well as compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the percentage organic matter desired
in the mix of the two, the volume ratio of
[SPEAKER_00]: the two that must be combined will be
determined as follows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to always start with that soil
test and having an organic matter
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage calculated on that soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is going to provide you with the
letter A here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be the kind of equation
we're going to go over.
[SPEAKER_00]: A is the current soil organic matter
percentage in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's based on your soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: B represents the organic percentage of the
organic amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as I said, you can assume it would be
100% for peat moss or compost are
[SPEAKER_00]: typically around 25 to 35%.
[SPEAKER_00]: C would be the target soil organic matter
percentage after amendment has been added.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to use about 5% for our
target.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will calculate X, which is the
fraction by weight of dry soil in the
[SPEAKER_00]: final mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 1 minus X is the fraction by weight of
dry organic amendment needed in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll also take this one step further and
go from weight to actually a volume,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what most people usually purchase
things in or tend to think in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at converting weights to
volumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the basic equation is going to be to
convert weights, which is X and 1 minus X,
[SPEAKER_00]: to volumes since you know how one will
work with the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: A conversion must be made using the dry
bulk densities of the material to be
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So PS located right here is the dry bulk
density of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for soil it's usually 1.0 to 1.2 grams
per cubic centimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can also be usually found on most
soil reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: PO represented right here is the dry bulk
density of the organic amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dry bulk densities for peat moss is
0.15 grams per cc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our compost is typically 0.5 to 0.7 grams
per cc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you're using a different dry
bulk density for your organic amendment,
[SPEAKER_00]: try to research and find out what the bulk
density is of that amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: S and T here, S is the volume of parts of
soil material.
[SPEAKER_00]: T is the volume parts of organic
amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you divide S by T, you obtain the
volume of parts per soil per one volume of
[SPEAKER_00]: organic amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while this is a lot of information
here, this is that background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go through an example and hope it
makes a little bit more sense here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's that example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind, right below me here,
I provide you with what I've shown before,
[SPEAKER_00]: what A, B, C, X, and 1 minus X stand for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've given us an example here to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this sense, if we send our soil out and
we get our organic matter percentage at
[SPEAKER_00]: 3.4%, we're going to be adding peat moss,
which is considered to be 100%,
[SPEAKER_00]: and our target organic matter percentage
would be 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question becomes, how much peat
moss do I need to add to my soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is 3.4%, to get to that target value
of 5.0% or soil organic matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we take 100 minus five, which is the
B minus A, which is the organic matter
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of the amendment, in this case
peat moss, minus the target organic matter
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We divide that by 100 minus 3.4,
or in this case it'd be B minus C,
[SPEAKER_00]: minus A.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100, which is the peat moss, which is the
organic amendment we'll be adding,
[SPEAKER_00]: minus the soil organic matter,
the A here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we take this and subtract those and
divide it by that, we get 9.834,
[SPEAKER_00]: and X minus one is to get the fraction by
weight of the dry peat moss needed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mix, which is 0.0166.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we want to convert these weights
to volumes, because that's typically how
[SPEAKER_00]: we think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is converted here to get to the
weights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now going to take this next step in
the next slide to go to volumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see the same numbers carried
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's our X.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our X minus one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PS is that 1.1 grams per cc.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the bulk density of the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then PO is the dry bulk density of the
organic amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is peat moss, we're using
0.15 grams per cc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see here we apply it to the
equation right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get our S.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get our T.
[SPEAKER_00]: We divide our S by a T.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get 8.076.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that number equate to or
mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that means, so you would add about
eight parts of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Per one part of peat moss, which
translated would be eight cubic yards of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil to every one cubic yard of peat moss
to get to that target level of 5.0%
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter from that original start of
3.4%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this kind of gives you some
information here to kind of go through
[SPEAKER_00]: your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to go back for just one moment,
with all this information here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can easily find what A, B,
and C are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could take your soil test reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apply that information to this example
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully develop a calculation so
you'll know exactly how much, how many
[SPEAKER_00]: cubic yards to purchase to ensure you're
getting the target soil organic matter
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want without over buying or under
buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says this is a lot better than
eyeballing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take a little time to go over this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be worth it in the end.
