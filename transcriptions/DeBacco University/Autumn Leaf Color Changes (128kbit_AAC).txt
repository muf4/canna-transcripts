[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, in this video I'm gonna give you a
brief overview regarding autumn leaf color
[SPEAKER_00]: changes and how we go from a deep green
leaf to slowly over time getting to a
[SPEAKER_00]: light green, getting to a yellow,
getting to an orange, to a red,
[SPEAKER_00]: to a deep red, and ultimately a brown
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on in the leaves through this
process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to start, what plants do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now all plants go through this color
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deciduous trees are the ones that go
through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones that drop leaves in the
fall time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When does this occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is the fall time or autumn.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a precise sequence of steps that
plants go through and have a very
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctive pattern that they follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is this advantageous to the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would a plant kind of like waste all
the energy it put into developing the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's using the most efficient time
of the year to maximizing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: then realizing in winter there's just not
a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very cold out and it drops its
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more efficient than just to chase and
go dormant during that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is only possible through a
very precise sequence of steps so the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant doesn't end up wasting energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, how do the trees know that
it's fall time?
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like every tree in a region knows
it's, quote, it's fall time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a couple key factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the shortening days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has reduced sunlight intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature is also decreasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's certain indicators that these
plants can sense that kind of oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's fall time, winter's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get ready and prepare myself to be
able to go dormant so I can survive
[SPEAKER_00]: through the harsh winter and come back
better and stronger in the springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it has to do with the position
of the northern or southern hemisphere in
[SPEAKER_00]: relation to the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we get our seasons because of
the tilt of the earth and how it rotates
[SPEAKER_00]: and then revolves around the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of this, this is how plants
know in our region.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we can develop these maps of
peak foliage times to be able to determine
[SPEAKER_00]: when might be the best time to go see some
of the better colors in different parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do the colors come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, color changes indicate changes in
concentrations of certain pigments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here kind of no change to trees
being bare and the coloration differences
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going on here as long as you're not
color blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically from late August or early
November is when we're seeing this
[SPEAKER_00]: transition occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this particular color palette here is
for sugar maple trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different trees may have different color
patterns they go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sugar maples in particular are known
for producing some very brilliant colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, leaves are green due to the high
percentage of chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as this gets depleted, other pigments
become more dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves don't actually change color.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a wrong misnomer that we
typically say.
[SPEAKER_00]: What actually happens is the colors are
always there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These happen to be hidden under the
dominant chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we reduce our chlorophyll,
the next most dominant pigment is this
[SPEAKER_00]: carotene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a yellow color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you break down the chlorophyll,
now we got our carotene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We break down that and we have our
anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as we break that down, we go from our
oranges to our reds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're changing the pH of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, the pH of the potential soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're changing weather conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what can cause a variability
in the color that may be seen in a region
[SPEAKER_00]: from year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: People always say it's going to be a good
color year or a bad year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bad color year, weather does play a little
bit of a factor in this to be able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the full color range that may occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's actually happening on the leaf
or the atomic level here, we're noticing
[SPEAKER_00]: that chlorophyll is, of course,
the most dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're breaking the chlorophyll
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carotenoids here may be maintained as
an orange or yellow color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robisco and other proteins are recycled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to realize this
transition of color is occurring because
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant is trying to conserve as much
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's breaking down the chlorophyll first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's breaking down the next stage
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that evident here, breaking
down the chlorophyll, then the carotene,
[SPEAKER_00]: then our anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's trying to conserve and store some
of this energy to be able to be ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: next spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it just simply dropped its leaves and
wasted all this energy that it put in,
[SPEAKER_00]: it may not have enough energy and reserves
to be able to produce these leaves in the
[SPEAKER_00]: following spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, it ends in cell death,
and that's the brown color that we
[SPEAKER_00]: typically see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And shortly after that, the leaves will
drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever notice when the leaves drop,
there's not much to them because the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: has tried to conserve or take back as much
usable products that it did produce and
[SPEAKER_00]: store them in the trunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: This then will be used as initial source
of energy to be able to push through the
[SPEAKER_00]: next leaves in the following spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people take advantage of some of
these stored sugars in the tree trunk
[SPEAKER_00]: through the process of making people's
syrup, where they need freezing
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures at night and above freezing
temperatures during the day to really get
[SPEAKER_00]: the sap flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're able to kind of harvest some
of the sugars that the plant has reserved
[SPEAKER_00]: in its trunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, that gives you some
appreciation for the color changes that we
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you a little bit of that
background of actually what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: from the plant standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
