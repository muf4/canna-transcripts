[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm gonna go over dihybrid
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've seen the Punnett square
basics, this builds on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see those were just monohybrid
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is dihybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see our Punnett square getting ever
larger here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, a dihybrid cross involves
two traits in a four-by-four Punnett
[SPEAKER_00]: square.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example is a pea plant that is
heterozygous for round yellow seeds is
[SPEAKER_00]: self-fertilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the phenotypic ratios of the
resulting offspring as we see here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So heterozygous round and yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So heterozygous for yellow also.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens if we cross two of these
individuals together?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how we got that trait by,
in this case, showing this potential
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome for the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at this F1 generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we need to first do is determine
the parental genotypes, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring, or the gametes that these can
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: To derive the gametes, we're gonna use the
FOIL method, and that's from math class.
[SPEAKER_00]: First outer, inner, last.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see this distribution that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, from this heterozygous and
heterozygous traits crossed together,
[SPEAKER_00]: two individuals, two parents, both
heterozygous for these traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice that parent one has big R.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go through and we cross it with big Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see our big R and our big Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big R also gets distributed,
though, to our little y.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big R, little y.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first parent, then, we need to also
recognize the other allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the recessive, the little r.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little r goes to big Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then little r goes to little y.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is parent one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, because they're both the same,
the parent two has the same potential
[SPEAKER_00]: gametes for offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big R goes to big Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big R to little y.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little r to big Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little r to little y.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are our genotypes that we're gonna
use in our four-by-four opponent square.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, this has a little
slightly different example, but we did
[SPEAKER_00]: find that was would be the gametes for
those individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at slightly different,
trying to make this example a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our gametes here, and our gamete
from this parent was all homozygous
[SPEAKER_00]: recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes it a little bit easier when we
go through and figure out this example,
[SPEAKER_00]: Punnett square.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as we saw in Punnett square
basics, we did the same cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: the same drag down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big R would be here, here, here,
and here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we remember big R with little r,
big R with little r, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: How this is gonna end up looking is like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of students I find put the R
and then do the R and the Y and the R and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not how you want it to represent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanna put like alleles together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, our big R and our little
r are put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our big Y and our little y are put
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go back and look, that would stand
for round and yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be the phenotype because round
is dominant and yellow is dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we notice that carry through
throughout the same here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can remember this individual different
than the initial example here is
[SPEAKER_00]: homozygous recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you notice all of the R's are kept
together and all of the Y's are kept
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we do that for organization is
when I ask for phenotypes, you're asked to
[SPEAKER_00]: give the phenotype, it makes it much
easier to follow and understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So providing this with a little bit of a
picture here, the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the homozygous recessive
individual, both is rough and green,
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: With homozygous dominant smooth and
yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The results in all plants will produce
this heterozygote here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at taking these
individuals and crossing them together in
[SPEAKER_00]: the F2 generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is our heterozygous and
heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crossing those together, this are
resulting offsprings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cross between two individuals from the
F1 generation increases variation due to
[SPEAKER_00]: the heterozygote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can notice here, it basically forms
a nine to three to three to one ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that represented right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, remember that yellow is dominant,
so it's smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rough in green would be the recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see one individual here from these two
heterozygotes would be that rough in that
[SPEAKER_00]: green color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know this is a little bit difficult
to follow maybe initially, but if you go
[SPEAKER_00]: back over and look at some of these
examples and follow where these gametes
[SPEAKER_00]: come from, I think it would be easier to
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is putting it all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a dihybrid cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have the initial generation,
the F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we take two of these individuals and
we want to cross them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where it gets a little bit more
confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we get to this four by
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the gametes are distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big R with big Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big R with little y.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little R with big Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little R with little y in the same hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just simply drag and cross them
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep like alleles together and it'll be a
whole lot easier.
