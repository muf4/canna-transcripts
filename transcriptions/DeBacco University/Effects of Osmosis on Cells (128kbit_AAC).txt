[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at the
effects of osmosis on cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three important key terms you want to be
familiar with are hypertonic, isotonic,
[SPEAKER_00]: and hypotonic, and how these relate and
how these change the structure of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cells and how some can lead to potentially
cell death and some basically just not
[SPEAKER_00]: functioning properly, and what isotonic is
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll look at each of these in detail and
how they relate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, starting with that same image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And defining our three key vocab terms
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isotonic is the one in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where solutions with the same
solute concentration as that of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytosol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, the cytosol is the interior
portion of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here we see water moving in and water
moving out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, equal, in, equal, out, isotonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hypertonic, solutions having greater
solute concentrations than that of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytosol, where water leaves the cell
causing this basic shrinkage to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hypertonic, the solution here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having greater solute concentration than
that of the cytosol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water leaving the cell causing it to
shrink.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is basically causing this
shriveled appearance to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opposite of that would be hypotonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where solutions have lesser solute
concentration than that of the cytosol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water enters the cell causing it to swell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it says here, potentially lice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Causing them, in this case, this cell is
licing or it's exploding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically breaking apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much water is coming into the cell
causing it to swell up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it looks a little more plump
than this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Causing, in this case, it to lice or break
apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, these are three kind of situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to think about how these cells are
being affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, those were animal cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually red blood cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're looking at a plant cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, plant cells have this exterior cell
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they have something a little
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant cells remain turgid or firm.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is generally the healthiest in the
hypotonic environment where the uptake of
[SPEAKER_00]: water is eventually balanced by the
elastic wall pushing back in the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here, turgid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have water coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This large vacuole is swelled up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of water containing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's able to keep and maintain
itself because plant cells have a cell
[SPEAKER_00]: wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, in our hypotonic situations,
if we go back to the red blood cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: this was the concept where they get to
ache and lice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, plant cells, a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have that cell wall and they can hold
that pressure and it keeps plants upright
[SPEAKER_00]: and vertical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isotonic, they become flaccid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can start to wilt a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, we're having some water come in
and out and that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we notice this little flaccid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here in extreme case, our hyperotonic
where a lot of water is leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is basically where the plant is
really wilting down pretty heavily where
[SPEAKER_00]: it can burn or cause severe damage to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hyperotonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do these situations look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hypertonic, osmotic flow out of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here's our solute molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is our cells here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, a great example of this,
Vika Cucumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you pickle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that pickling solution, the brine
solution, high amount of salt
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration in that liquid environment
causing our wonderful looking,
[SPEAKER_00]: nice, streamlined cucumber to become like
a pickle, to shrivel up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's occurring here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water molecules are leaving the cell in
this case to try to dilute the solute,
[SPEAKER_00]: or in this case, the salt that's located
on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what causes the pickle to get
that shriveled up versus a cucumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hypotonic, now is the opposite of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Osmotic's flowing into the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all swelling up.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, there's more solid molecules
inside the cell and there are outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be if you put something in pure
water, distilled water, free of ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can cause cells to swell up and if
they're red blood cells, they cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately lice or break apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isotonic has an equal movement of water
molecules both in and out of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the same as no movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the side molecules are the same on the
inside and the outside and water's coming
[SPEAKER_00]: in and out at the same rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each molecule in results in one molecule
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, there appears to be no change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this one says no osmotic flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be kind of misleading if I put it
down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: No osmotic flow, most people think that's
just not gonna move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's gonna stay where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's not necessarily the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water can be coming in, but for every
molecule that comes in, one comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: For every molecule that comes out,
one comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is where we get to equal
movement, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not no movement, but equal movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it appears there's to be no change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, hypertonic, hypotonic, and isotonic
showing the same images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, hypertonic is like the salt
solution causing it to kind of shrink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hypotonic, the cell is swelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isotonic, it's equal movement in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at our red blood cells,
this is the proper shape they should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they swell too big, they can lice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they shrink and shrivel here,
they're just not gonna perform their
[SPEAKER_00]: proper function.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how they look in real world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we can see a little bit harder to tell
on initial quick look, but isotonic,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's start with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how they should look.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are red blood cells, RBC is their
abbreviation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how they should look.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice in comparison to how the
properly formed red blood cells look,
[SPEAKER_00]: our hypotonic ones are definitely larger,
definitely plump.
[SPEAKER_00]: No real kind of depression in the middle,
no biconcave disc actually reducing the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface area in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't lice, they're just,
they don't have as great a surface area to
[SPEAKER_00]: volume ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hypertonic, notice that they're kind of
getting this jagged appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This jagged appearance is because they're
shrinking, they're shrinking down and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what's causing the jagged
appearance, the collapse of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of water is leading the cell,
causing it to kind of shrink and shrivel
[SPEAKER_00]: up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example of what's unseen out of
the microscope, where we have water
[SPEAKER_00]: exiting the cell causing it to shrink,
water entering the cell causing it to
[SPEAKER_00]: swell, and this is how it should look
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, flipping back, our hypotonic is
that swelling, that'd be represented as
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here where it's all equal, we flip back,
that's how they should look, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: isotonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And shriveling up would be hypertonic,
example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hypertonic, hypotonic, and isotonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Key terms to be able to know and
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plasmolysis is when the cell loses water
in a hypertonic solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is looking at a plant cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking specifically at the vacuole
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vacuole here, hypotonic all nicely swelled
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're noticing we're going into that iso
to hypertonic here where that water is
[SPEAKER_00]: leading the cell at a greater rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're noticing that vacuole is getting
smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we represented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it's taking up like 90% of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it's a lot less and it could even get
in a worse situation where it takes up
[SPEAKER_00]: even a smaller portion of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Importantly in our body system,
the hydrostatic and osmotic pressure is in
[SPEAKER_00]: our kidneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrostatic pressure is water pressure and
it's filtration that our kidneys go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and do is passage of water and
solutes through a membrane through
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrostatic pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pressure gradient pushes solute containing
fluid from higher pressure area to lower
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a brief overview here, the filtration
process that the kidneys go through is
[SPEAKER_00]: based a lot on this osmotic pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why there's a lot of folds here,
a lot of membranes, so we want to excrete
[SPEAKER_00]: certain waste products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to retain some water and some of
those things also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the kidneys throughout all these little
areas here, not going to go into great
[SPEAKER_00]: details here, go through this osmotic
pressure, this hydrostatic pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: filled up with water pressure that's
occurring allowing us to properly filter
[SPEAKER_00]: our blood and other fluids to be able to
excrete pure waste products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope that was helpful.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
