[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over some canvas bud
[SPEAKER_00]: storage options, some do's and don'ts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you can select a proper
location for good long-term storage of
[SPEAKER_00]: what you've put so much effort into.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into canvas bud
storage options here, ones to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, what not to store canvas
in ideally would be plastic is not
[SPEAKER_00]: advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plastic can be used for short-term
storage, but here we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term storage, and in this case,
plastic would not be advised either in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic baggy form or even in the plastic
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically not advised for the longer-term
storage, great for short-term or transfer,
[SPEAKER_00]: no problem with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the fridge, typically not an advised
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: The refrigerator and freezer, there is
likely an automatic defroster that can
[SPEAKER_00]: cause swings in humidity that can result
in potential for plant damage,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly if you don't have a
completely good seal on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be mindful of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Refrigeration temperature is a good thing,
but sometimes directly in the
[SPEAKER_00]: refrigerator, there's too much fluctuation
of those temperatures that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what is advised, I do recommend using
humidity packs and two-way humidity packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the Bodevo ones that can be used
to help maintain consistent conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're two-way, which means that they
can help raise or lower humidity to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it within that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, both of these would be
keeping it as close to 62% humidity as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this does not mean that if you have
wild swings in humidity that you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to regulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're already kind of close,
by inserting one of these packs,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll help it maintain definitely within
the desired range, and they come in
[SPEAKER_00]: different humidities.
[SPEAKER_00]: 62% for cannabis tends to be one of the
more common ones that's utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your general storage conditions,
well, stable inert storage container,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll talk more about those on other
videos on this channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minimal light, particularly UV light,
and temperatures of four degrees Celsius
[SPEAKER_00]: or lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if there's all these different
specialty storage options, as we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: here, does not need to be necessarily some
high-end store here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be kind of simple, put in a closed
cupboard here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as it's stable conditions,
the material it's made out of is inert,
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal light, particularly UV light,
and the temperatures are relatively cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All good advice here as far as keeping
your cannabis buds in nice long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: duration storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be more detailed videos on this
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to search, but hopefully
this gives you just general an idea to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider, and you can get more into the
specifics on other videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
Thank you.
