[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another DeBaco University
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be looking at
individual and class evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at identifying
potential evidence, does it fall into a
[SPEAKER_00]: category where we're looking at we can
eliminate large or make broad statements
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of put it into a class category?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are we able to refine that down to a
potential individual?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at evidence in
general, we want to keep in mind that
[SPEAKER_00]: typically we're looking at this class this
general category of physical evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physical evidence is any item that can be
established as a link between the crime
[SPEAKER_00]: and a victim or the perpetrator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examples are document, hair, fibers,
fingerprints, soil, and blood would all
[SPEAKER_00]: fall in the category of physical evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now class evidence, a little refinement on
that physical evidence, characteristics of
[SPEAKER_00]: this physical evidence that can be
associated only with a group and not a
[SPEAKER_00]: single source falls under the category of
class evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intention of this is to reduce the
number of suspects, but it cannot pinpoint
[SPEAKER_00]: one person or source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example would be blood type, fibers,
paint.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all examples of class evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're looking at and identifying
that there's a positive blood at the
[SPEAKER_00]: scene, well, that will eliminate the other
blood types, but it won't specify an
[SPEAKER_00]: individual person.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find certain fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might find a garment that they may
match closely with, but it doesn't say it
[SPEAKER_00]: was that garment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, when we have individual
evidence, well, the characteristics of
[SPEAKER_00]: individual evidence are that physical
evidence that can be connected to a common
[SPEAKER_00]: source with a high degree of certainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that contains nuclear DNA,
tool marks, for example, also
[SPEAKER_00]: fingerprints, can fall under the general
category of being individual evidence
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're able to eliminate a lot more
potential suspects and get ideally to that
[SPEAKER_00]: single person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind hair as an example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hair varies in texture from one region of
the body to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can only be used to determine
similarities and not a single source
[SPEAKER_00]: connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, hair falls under the category
of class evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example, how round or oval cross-section
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically Caucasians tend to have more of
that rounder kind of appearance to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oval, flat, and cross-section tends to be
more that of African Americans,
[SPEAKER_00]: but again, this is only class evidence and
not looking at identifying any one
[SPEAKER_00]: particular individual.
