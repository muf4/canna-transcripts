[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a fan of autoflowers, but wondered
why there are no cannabis autoflower
[SPEAKER_00]: clones available?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here in this Tobacco University,
we're going to answer that question for
[SPEAKER_00]: you right here in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into answering this
question on why there are no cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflower clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want you first to realize that if
this is possible, cloning an autoflower is
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the resulting plant will flower much
too early to produce any viable yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is this the case that it is
possible to get an autoflower to root,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's going to yield so much earlier?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that the case when we're taking a
small little clone from the original stock
[SPEAKER_00]: or mother plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is important because cloning
does not reset the plant's internal clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to keep this in mind that the
clone follows the timeline as the mother
[SPEAKER_00]: or stock plant, meaning if the mother or
stock plant is an autoflower plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes about 10 weeks or so as an
example from seed to flower and you clone
[SPEAKER_00]: it on week six, the clone will be in
harvest mode in only about four weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's still set on that 10 week
seed to flowering time scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the stress of cloning, this process
will result typically in minimal yields,
[SPEAKER_00]: a small plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that timing and resetting the
plant clock simply doesn't happen just
[SPEAKER_00]: because you clone that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind or as a reminder,
autoflowers are simply based on days old,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the duration of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once the plant emerges, the clock
basically starts on an autoflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you clone a plant material,
it's still X days old.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cloning process does not cause the
plant to start from day one again,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it's a small plant,
even though we're kind of going through
[SPEAKER_00]: that regrowing process does not reset that
plant's internal clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, the plant keeps counting from
when it first emerged.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why clones from autoflowers are
not going to be worthwhile for total
[SPEAKER_00]: yield, even though it is possible to get
them to root and to grow into plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are definitely going to be smaller
plants there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there a situation for cloned
autoflowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just speaking in general,
in isolated cases for potential breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: of lineages, but this does not pertain to
very many growers and therefore this is
[SPEAKER_00]: why you don't see autoflowers as an
example if you're looking at purchasing
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, see you next time.
