[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at cell
membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of one, a lot of
going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping in mind the cytoplasm is on the
inside of the cell and the extracellular
[SPEAKER_00]: fluid is on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the membrane that's dividing the
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there's a lot going on
here with our phospholipid bilayer and our
[SPEAKER_00]: protein channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to learn about a little bit
and hopefully explain what some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with what we're focusing on,
that membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the area located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see these large bluish purple kind
of ovals represent proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're just focused on this
perimeter of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone over cell organelles,
all these wonderful things on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're focusing just on the perimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first the overcoming the cell barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cell membrane is a barrier,
but nutrients have to get into the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: because the cell needs those to be able to
survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And products and waste must get out of the
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while this is a barrier, it can't be
completely solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be exchanging certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Permeability determines what moves in and
out of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have our red blood cells with
CO2 in this case coming in and then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: transported through.
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 will then have to leave the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this cell barrier, this membrane is
allowing certain things to come in,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also needs to allow things to go out
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cell barrier, the way to think
about this is it is not impermeable,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means it would let nothing in or
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this rock wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not freely permeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it lets anything pass through,
like this revolving door, it can come in
[SPEAKER_00]: and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what we call selectively permeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It restricts the movement, like the
bouncer here at the nightclub or bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overcoming the cell barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cell membrane is selectively permeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the key term here for cell
barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows some materials to move freely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It restricts other materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see here the larger molecules
are kept on one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: The small molecules are let through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only certain molecules are let through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are repelled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So restricted materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selectively permeable restricts certain
materials based on, could be their size,
[SPEAKER_00]: their electrical charge, their molecular
shape, their lipid solubility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any one of these can restrict the
materials to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrophobic materials are lipid soluble
and can pass right through the membrane
[SPEAKER_00]: rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polar molecules do not cross the membrane
very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now polar, remember, are water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lipids are kind of like those waxy
coatings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And transport proteins allow passage of
hydrophilic substances across the
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these transport proteins, these are
those things we saw embedded in the
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane, they can allow certain things to
come through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Membrane function.
[SPEAKER_00]: All cells are surrounded by a plasma
membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cell membranes are composed of a lipid
bilayer with globular proteins embedded in
[SPEAKER_00]: that bilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, let's look at another example of
this picture of this cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have our phospholipid bilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here with our heads and tails from our
lipid-based tails, phospho-based or
[SPEAKER_00]: charge-based polar heads, creating this
bilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In here we have our integral proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be channel proteins,
peripheral proteins just exist on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, glycoproteins are proteins of the
carbohydrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, glyco, think glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: A glycolipid is a lipid of the
carbohydrate attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain things here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are important for recognition
and also allowing things to pass through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's that same picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The function, again, the membrane,
the external surface, carbohydrate groups
[SPEAKER_00]: join with lipids and form glycolipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with proteins that form glycoproteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: These function for cell identity markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an important aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure we're identifying
things that are occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like you in school when
you're wearing your IDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a way for cells to identify what
they're bumping into or what's one cell
[SPEAKER_00]: differ than another cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This membrane is not a completely rigid
structure like we saw with the rock wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what we call a fluid mosaic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fluid, like water and the waves here,
and mosaic, all these little pieces coming
[SPEAKER_00]: together to form the mosaic of the eagle
flying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this fluid mosaic is, is we have
our hydrophobic, remember, purine water,
[SPEAKER_00]: tails, metal lipids, and our phosphate
heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fluid mosaic, this 3D model kind of
shows it rotating here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows a little bit better of an idea
that it's kind of like moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a completely rigid structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got this fluid mosaic-like model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's able to move a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this mosaic-like appearance is what's
causing the overall look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking specifically at the details,
we have our hydrophilic head and our
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrophobic tails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, our saturated and unsaturated
fatty acids from our macromolecules and
[SPEAKER_00]: our hydrophilic head, the phosphate and
the glycerol here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, we're saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is single bonds, including
tails are very straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's mixed with unsaturated,
you'll notice the double bond forms and
[SPEAKER_00]: are unsaturated, causing this little kick
in the tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phospholipid bilayer, mainly two
layers of phospholipids, the non-polar
[SPEAKER_00]: tails point inwards here, and the polar
heads on the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these contain cholesterol,
especially in animal cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fluid allowing proteins to move
around within the bilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those proteins that we saw are not
fixed in one location.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can move and put out some of these
and move their way through the
[SPEAKER_00]: phospholipid bilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can form the sheet or some of these
kind of circular vesicle-like looking
[SPEAKER_00]: structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cholesterol affect membrane fluidity
within animal cells in their membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here's cholesterol bound in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to keep our cholesterol low,
but we don't want it to be zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have some cholesterol in there
because it's going to affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: permeability of our phospholipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cholesterol that we're getting
measured in our blood is different than
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually bound up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cholesterol in our blood is moving
through our vesicles and involving and
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in contact with red blood cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is embedded within all animal cells
membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Membrane proteins, membranes are this kind
of embedded portion here in the lipid
[SPEAKER_00]: bilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peripheral proteins are proteins that are
loosely bound to the surface of the
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these peripheral proteins are on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be important for recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean they're not important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Integral proteins could pass the entire
way through and channel proteins also pass
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire way through the phospholipid
bilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind these peripheral proteins as
well as these integral and channel
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins can work their way and move
through the lipid bilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like you moving through a busy crowd,
same thing with these proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our integral proteins penetrate a
hydrophobic core in the lipid bilayer,
[SPEAKER_00]: often transmembrane proteins, completely
spanning the membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like our channel are integral proteins
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some other renditions and showing
that there is the external and internal
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions of the cell being spanned by
these proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solutions and transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember solution could be homogeneous
mixture composed of two or more
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cell vent and the cell ute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cell vent is the design of the
dissolving medium and the cell ute is the
[SPEAKER_00]: components in smaller quantities in the
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my example here of salt water,
the dissolving medium, that is the water,
[SPEAKER_00]: our cell ute in this case would be the
salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intercellular fluid, neoplasm and cytosol.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's inside the cell and
extracellular fluid that's on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a plasma.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about blood cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember intra is the inside and in this
case extracellular fluid could be our
[SPEAKER_00]: exterior cell fluid is an example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exterior of the cells or tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I want you to think about
when we look at our cells and our
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition and some of the other videos
might be helpful is are cell domains like
[SPEAKER_00]: nightclubs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they allowing certain things to come
in and basically bouncing or rejecting
[SPEAKER_00]: other things from coming in?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do they go about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does recognition and cell
communication and IDs come into play here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this cell membrane is important that it
doesn't want to let anything just come in
[SPEAKER_00]: and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to help regulate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are these integral proteins and the
basic structure of the phospholipid and
[SPEAKER_00]: pay attention that word phospho and lipid
bilayer coming into play?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question to ask and relate it to cell
membranes.
