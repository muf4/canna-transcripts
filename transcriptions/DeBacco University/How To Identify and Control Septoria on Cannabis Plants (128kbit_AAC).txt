[SPEAKER_00]: If you have leaves that look like this on
your cannabis plant, odds are you probably
[SPEAKER_00]: have septoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
we'll provide you with proper
[SPEAKER_00]: identification as well as control
techniques for this particular disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at how to identify
and control septoria on cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, proper identification is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And septoria leaf spot can cause leaf loss
and reduction in photosynthesis and is one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the most common leaf spot pathogens
among hemp leaf spot diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see a great image of that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scout lower leaves and within the inner
canopy where leaf wetness and high
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity occur, as this is likely a place
for the disease to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for small irregular shaped spots with
bright yellow margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spots expand to about a quarter inch in
diameter and appear brown with predominant
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow halo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here that predominant
yellow halo clearly evident.
[SPEAKER_00]: As spots enlarge, brown areas become more
regular and develop gray to white centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow halos expand outwards from those
spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire leaf rapidly becomes yellow and
can drop from plants in advanced cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the life cycle of septoria and looking
at from two different aspects here,
[SPEAKER_00]: showing you kind of what's happening in
those little spots, showing you kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: all those little fungal spores that are
developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pathogen can overwinter as mycelium
and then can reinfect plants the following
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to clean those portions up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing an example here of again,
wind and rain splash spores kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: knocking those off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those can then go through and develop as
early lesions as yellow spots on newly
[SPEAKER_00]: emerged plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cycle can repeat itself if conditions
are favorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: When those leaves do drop off the plant,
they serve as overwintering areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is showing soybeans, but the same
thing does apply to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the overwintering spore can occur,
proper conditions cause it to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: proliferate and affect new plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you go about managing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of shows a really good kind
of zoomed in version here.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this is not cannabis, this is
showing you the great image of what
[SPEAKER_00]: septoria can look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of it in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When excessive moisture or high humidity
is available, the fungal life cycles are
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter and larger number of spores are
produced, both negative things if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at trying to mitigate this
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can increase the chance of disease
later in plants' life cycle when the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are more dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: During rainy summers, disease can spread
rapidly through fields if you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: this in an outdoor application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Septoria species can overwinter in fields
on effective plant debris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under cool conditions with low relative
humidity, the pinnitia can remain viable
[SPEAKER_00]: for up to nine months in debris.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, pinnitia survives decreased
dramatically in hot weather and when in
[SPEAKER_00]: buried soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, tilling for less than one
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you already have infected material
of a large scale and you till that in,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be a way to reduce the life
expectancy of septoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although alternative hosts have not been
identified for septoria species that cause
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf spot and hemp, it is likely that
weeds and other similar green bridges are
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for survival from one growing
season to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're still looking at investigating
this more, but as are these green bridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spreads to another weed host,
another disease host, resides there and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the following year it can gen jump
from that original host that it carried
[SPEAKER_00]: over and infect your hemp plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this gives you a little
insight into septoria, which is sadly very
[SPEAKER_00]: commonly seen on cannabis.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for joining us.
