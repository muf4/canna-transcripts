[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to be looking at
cloning with the EasyClone, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially available product.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, this is the EasyClone Low
Pro 64, meaning that it will clone up to
[SPEAKER_00]: 64 cuttings at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a form of aeroponic propagation here,
and we'll go through just some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: basics of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some growers have a love-hate
relationship with the EasyClone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be very efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put in quotes here, it can be the best
system if there's attention to detail by
[SPEAKER_00]: the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people see this EasyClone is just
too intricate, too much detail,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like the small gears in a watch
here, and too difficult to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm here to shed some light on what it
takes to actually use this properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part is to optimize the EasyClone
conditions, with pH being the first
[SPEAKER_00]: priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing the pH and maintaining is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the pH is not monitored, this is
typically a result of poor to non-existent
[SPEAKER_00]: rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example here, a pH of 4.96 will be much
too acidic, and this would lead to poor
[SPEAKER_00]: rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is where a lot of people
go wrong with the EasyClone, is they're
[SPEAKER_00]: just not monitoring or aware of what the
pH is in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Managing heat is another issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So location cloners is placed,
can contribute to the reservoir heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the pump, the water pump that's
used, and this is the spray bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pump also does generate some heat,
so that's important to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a slightly warmer water temp is
advantageous, but only to a certain point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good that there's a little heat
generated, but if it's already in a warm
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, that could cause some issues
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: An area that may only have bottom heat
will only exacerbate the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to just be mindful of the area
you're putting it in, knowing that this
[SPEAKER_00]: pump will still produce a little bit of
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The BlueLab Guardian Monitor here is a
great all-in-one tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can monitor the EC, which is the
dissolved solids.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, I have it in parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also monitor the temperature,
it can go from Fahrenheit or Celsius,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also the pH here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's options to be linked to remote
devices, so you don't even have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: present to watch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a standalone unit in the image
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to add to the reservoir,
so plain water can work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrient solutions can also help speed up
the rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two popular products are the Clonex
solution pictured here, and also Olivia's
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, which rooting solution to use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've run trials on both,
and the Clonex takes an extra day or so to
[SPEAKER_00]: root in comparison to the Olivia's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Olivia does root the quickest.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the Clonex is pH stable,
while Olivia's does require almost daily
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to monitor and maintain a proper
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clonex, based on the recommended use by
the manufacturer, does cost less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Olivia's is slightly more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clonex does produce a clean solution
that's very pump- and filter-friendly,
[SPEAKER_00]: while the Olivia's does have leftover
particulate which can clog a filter if
[SPEAKER_00]: used over time and don't take that step of
cleaning that on a regular schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidity control on EasyClone,
so it can run without extra humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: added, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is if the lighting's not too intense
and the heat's kept to a minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: In certain instances, it may be necessary
to add some misting system if it's already
[SPEAKER_00]: in a warm environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But watch the amount and size of the water
droplets you use, because it is possible
[SPEAKER_00]: to unintentionally overfill the reservoir
stopping the continual water spray of the
[SPEAKER_00]: aeroponics that's needed to keep that
rooting environment going.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why you see examples here of a
plastic bag over it to help water sheet
[SPEAKER_00]: away and not get caught in the cloner and
overfill in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a result of the environment
it was placed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we want to eliminate water from
unintentionally being entered,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you're not adding extra humidity or
mist, this shouldn't be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long should you leave your cuttings in
the cloner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you want to see until the roots
emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: While plants can grow in this system,
once roots are about the width of the
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting foam, they should be removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, this would be a great
time to remove these cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you'll have some that root
earlier and some that root later.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage of this system is you can
remove individual clones when you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: they're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the basic setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this is in a greenhouse,
since cuttings do not need full sun,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is not a requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the misting system, this misting bar
here was used as the heat since it was in
[SPEAKER_00]: the greenhouse, but also notice that the
electrical outlets located up here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor are kept above the mist bar,
keeping them out of this high mist
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and only keeping the cloner in
that misting environment here to eliminate
[SPEAKER_00]: the stress on the ceilings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
