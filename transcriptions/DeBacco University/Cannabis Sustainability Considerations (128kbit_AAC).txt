[SPEAKER_00]: As the growing and production of cannabis
continues to gain popularity, we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: have considerations towards its long-term
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this Tobacco University video,
the goal here is going to be to cover some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these major topics regarding cannabis
sustainability for the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at cannabis
sustainability considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, cannabis cultivation is kind
of emerging.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the start of the increase in
popularity due to produced cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, this is the time to ensure that it
starts on the proper path.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just in the early phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start on the proper path and go
forward in a sustainable manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers need to be considering the
sustainability of their practices no
[SPEAKER_00]: matter the size of their operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times it's like, oh, I'm a small
operation, I have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Larger operations need to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, everyone needs to be considerate
of the sustainability of agriculture in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So correcting past problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going, looking back, maybe not
necessarily this far back, but seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: problems that have developed in other
industries, the goal should be that of
[SPEAKER_00]: prevention over sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: All
[SPEAKER_00]: right, so let's get into cannabis
sustainability considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, cannabis cultivation is
emerging.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the start of the increase in
popularity to produce cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the time to ensure that it starts
and continues on the proper path.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of just coming into this
kind of emerging industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We correct the problems now and make it
more sustainable now that can continue and
[SPEAKER_00]: be the path of the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers need to be considering the
sustainability of their practices no
[SPEAKER_00]: matter the size of their operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many growers think, oh, I'm a small
operation, I have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more for larger operations and
that's false.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone needs to be considering the
sustainability of their practices no
[SPEAKER_00]: matter how large or small of a growing
operation that they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to correct past problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we say past problems, we may not
be going back as far as kind of Egyptian
[SPEAKER_00]: times, but seeing problems that have
developed in other industries,
[SPEAKER_00]: the goal should be that of prevention and
overall sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to correct problems before they
become a major problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many seed cannabis has its own category in
kind of many ways it can be, but
[SPEAKER_00]: considering large scale production,
sustainability is important even if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: only going to be a small indoor grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be considerate of all the
environmental impacts that this plant may
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you must think big picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many growers come from a small under 10
plant growing perspective, or that's how
[SPEAKER_00]: they kind of perceive or see cannabis as
being this kind of small.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple plants go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, growers need to consider
scalability of their actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing 10 plants, could you
implement the same practices?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, given a limited budget,
would that be possible with 10,000 plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be the overall impact of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any little waste, you scale it up from 10
plants, it becomes a much larger waste
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to use phosphorus here as
just an example because a lot of growers
[SPEAKER_00]: over fertilize their plants with
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis, as many other plants,
do need phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, many growers are over-applying
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say over-applying phosphorus or
over-applying it without even realizing
[SPEAKER_00]: it, which is part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus toxicity is not as obvious as
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many growers are unknowingly
over-applying phosphorus with no,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least visual negative impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, phosphorus is becoming a limiting
resource and is a freshwater contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're using these heavy kind of bloom
based fertilizers to avoid any chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: yellowing the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that could be contributing to
freshwater algal blooms and contamination
[SPEAKER_00]: of that water supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yellowing leaves has a lot more
implications potentially than just
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a whole host of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But growers are often way over-adding
their phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, because you get into toxicity levels,
because the plants visually don't show a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of negative effects, growers are very
apt to do it because they don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: realize they're doing it at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want to waste a limited
resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phosphorus is a limited resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canvas growers need to be aware of how
much phosphorus their plants need and how
[SPEAKER_00]: much phosphorus their plants can uptake
and how that compares to the amount that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're applying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many are over-applying and do not realize
the waste and potential negative impacts
[SPEAKER_00]: on the environment they could be having.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important to have that
education there to realize that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: negative implications of over-applying
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why do we need to transform the
phosphorus use in the global food system?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this even goes beyond just looking at
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But phosphorus is basically food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's needed for a whole host of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growing food demand is equal to
growing phosphorus demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only a finite amount of
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to lead to potential for
geopolitical risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insufficient global food system to
distribute that food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased fertilizer cost as the
phosphorus that we're getting to in some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the mines is becoming less pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's really no guidelines or no
regulations of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give you an idea of this kind of
geopolitical risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five countries control almost 90% of the
global phosphate reserves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight countries account for about 65% of
the global sulfuric acid production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only five controlling 90%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a major area of concern with
China and Morocco being the greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: percentages as far as countries go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need to think when we're talking
about cannabis waste disposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this concludes all products that are
required for plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are disposable and some are short
term used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others may be longer term use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the end, they all must be disposed
of in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just consider where the products you
purchase end up and just have that mindset
[SPEAKER_00]: or that consideration for anything that
you're utilizing as part of your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lastly here, just to focus on one thing
is looking at artificial lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be considered of the physical
components of that artificial lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ballast, the bulbs,
the cords, as well as other lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the electrical needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All lights consume power.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where is this power coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're looking at growing outdoor
cannabis, you might think, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we want to be thinking of potentially
your weed control options, your plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption, and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no system is completely free of any
waste products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to have an idea of where that's going
to end up, how you're going to utilize
[SPEAKER_00]: that, and how you're going to grow your
plant in an efficient as well as a
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable way.
Thank you.
