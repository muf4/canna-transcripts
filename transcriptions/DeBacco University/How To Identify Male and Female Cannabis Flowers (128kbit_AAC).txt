[SPEAKER_01]: In this Debaco University video I'll go
over how to identify male and female
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis flowers both in pictures as well
as take you out in the field to do some
[SPEAKER_01]: identification there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in this image we see a nice female
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this video lecture we'll be going over
how to identify male and female cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers both in pictures as well as in the
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first off those important preflowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're looking at plants the first
ones are going to produce are those little
[SPEAKER_01]: preflowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers should first look at the nodes
which is the junctions between the leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: and branches and the stalks of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where you're going to find those
preflowers to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Preflowers begin to develop four to six
weeks into the growing cycle at the nodes
[SPEAKER_01]: and during this time growers should be
able to identify the gender of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: as being male as we see here or female as
we see down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These immature flowers will show the male
or female morphology well before they're
[SPEAKER_01]: able to produce viable components for seed
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're identifying a male plant here
no problem no pollen is produced or
[SPEAKER_01]: released and a female plant here they're
not ready to kind of receive any sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Removing the males at this time will help
ensure no chance of accidental pollination
[SPEAKER_01]: will occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Male preflowers we simply want to be
looking for small pollen sacs and for
[SPEAKER_01]: female preflowers want to be looking for
two stigmas which are typically white in
[SPEAKER_01]: coloration.
[SPEAKER_01]: These would be the areas that would be
receiving the pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: These would be the areas would be
producing the pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now those female plants just focus on
those just a little bit more specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well females are the plants that will
produce the cannabinoids and the greatest
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations within the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If female plants receive pollen though
from male plants seeds will be produced
[SPEAKER_01]: which will drastically reduce the
cannabinoid production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is grown via sensimila which
stands for basically seedless by removing
[SPEAKER_01]: male pollen producing plants to prevent
seed production.
[SPEAKER_01]: This allows the cannabis plant to focus
its energy on cannabinoid production
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Female plants will only be pollinated to
produce seeds for breeding purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part we want those buds we
can see right here female plant to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: higher cannabinoids not seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we go over to male plants now for
comparison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Male cannabis plants are grown for pollen
sacs instead of buds and are often
[SPEAKER_01]: discarded to avoid female plants from
becoming pollinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Male plants are important in the breeding
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now pollinating male plants shape,
rate of growth, pest and mold resistance,
[SPEAKER_01]: and climate resilience can be important
for breeding purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So knowing how the male plant performs
could offer some importance for breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: because that will influence the seeds or
the following generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Male plants can also be used for hemp and
fiber in some cases concentrate production
[SPEAKER_01]: but concentrate is much less than female
plants and how we're going to go about
[SPEAKER_01]: identifying those well these are going to
be our little early pre flowers for male
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've showed you some great pictures
give you some great information now let's
[SPEAKER_01]: take a second let's go in the field and
compare both male and female flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we see those brown pistils this is an
early indication of a female pre flower so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's important to identify these early
male versus female plants and this one
[SPEAKER_01]: will be a female and this will be kept in
the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an attempt to show you the stages
of development here we have a male flower
[SPEAKER_01]: very early on in development as we work
our way down the stem here you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: further and further developed male
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again none of these have opened yet so
no threat to the field but the earlier you
[SPEAKER_01]: can identify and the earlier you can row
out these plants the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we can see the structures of that male
flower definitely here is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: where we're going to be producing our
pollen so this is what defines it here as
[SPEAKER_01]: male flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that those are the most
developed we have some that are not quite
[SPEAKER_01]: as developed as at this moment in time
located right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is definitely the time you want to be
able to clearly identify them as male and
[SPEAKER_01]: these should be removed from the field if
you're looking at producing higher
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid and terpene products in
production rather than seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here you can see a very early male pre
flower it's located right here so I know
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a little difficult to kind of see
there but the earlier you can identify
[SPEAKER_01]: male pre flowers the earlier you can row
out these male plants in the field
[SPEAKER_01]: producing any chance of pollination in
producing seeds to get the maximum yield
[SPEAKER_01]: from your buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if we work our way down a plant you
can clearly see how those male flowers can
[SPEAKER_01]: really start to stack up there and this
plant if not removed would have produced a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That pollen would not be wanted in this
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see just the plethora of male
flowers and how they cluster and develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great look here at male pre flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great look at male pre flowers here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very early on you can see as you work your
way down they do get a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: advanced but trying to identify male
plants is important to rogue those out so
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have any cross pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look down the plant in general you
just get an idea of this male plant how
[SPEAKER_01]: much flowers they can produce and how much
pollen it is possible for them to release.
[SPEAKER_01]: One plant left in the field can really
cause an issue to all of your crops here
[SPEAKER_01]: to your entire field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here that one male plant could easily
pollinate these thousands and thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants or at least reduce the yield of
flower.
