[SPEAKER_00]: Watering your plants is often a necessity
as well as adding fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fertilizer applicators are going to be
gone over in this tobacco university video
[SPEAKER_00]: to improve your efficiency with cannabis
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over fertilizer
applicators for efficient cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the options?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's many options.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are going to be a few that will be
covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to provide you with the pros and
cons of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as when you select one,
hopefully search this channel and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to find a more detailed video on
that particular type.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these, though, are intended to be
able to deliver nutrients to plants via
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an efficient method since plants
will need to be irrigated anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irrigation with fertilizer can help
prevent deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see venturis, injectors, piston pumps,
pressurized tank, as well as a diluted
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation tank as all viable options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, looking at the venturi
injector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the advantages is low cost,
it is water powered, simple to use,
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrates while it's operating,
and there's basically no moving parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are great advantages to the venturi
injector.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, some of the disadvantages are
that pressure drop is created in the
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you already have a low pressure
system, this may not be the best option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the calibration depends on the
chemical level in the tank and can
[SPEAKER_00]: fluctuate as your tank level changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it gets to piston pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, piston pumps are very precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have linear calibration, they can
tolerate very high pressures, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: calibration is independent of the pressure
that they're being exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they offer a great level of
consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are probably the most popular used
in larger scale as well as smaller scale
[SPEAKER_00]: operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantages is that they do tend to
cost more compared to everything else
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may need to stop to adjust for
calibration and the internal parts do wear
[SPEAKER_00]: out over time and may need replacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when they are operational,
they're high precision and ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: really dial in a nutrient feeding program
is why they are so popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into pressurized tank mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of the middle cost range.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fairly easy to operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The total chemical volume is accurately
controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are all great benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantage is the pressure
differential is required and this variable
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical concentration provided to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also cannot be calibrated for
consistent injection rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're kind of having a little bit of
variability there, which might cause
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes plants to get over fertilized
and some plants to potentially become
[SPEAKER_00]: under fertilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last one, the most simple,
is looking at a diluted irrigation tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at a diluted irrigation
tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really no need for equipment
beyond a water pump and a tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why this can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Provides growers to know when fertilizer
is added and what concentration,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you're adding X amount of
fertilizer to the tank and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigating with that tank water,
then you know exactly what the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does require a large tank equal to the
size of the irrigation volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes as we see in the picture
here, multiple irrigation tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also does not allow for concentrated
mixes to be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go through dilute and make
sure it's evenly distributed there before
[SPEAKER_00]: you can go on and irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some options here when you're
looking at fertilizer and adding it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find one that you really like,
search this channel and hopefully you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: find a more detailed video to get you
dialed in even further.
