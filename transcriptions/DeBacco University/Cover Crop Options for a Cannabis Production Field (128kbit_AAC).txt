[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBacco University video,
I'm going to go over cover crop options
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis production field.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this will apply to basically any
field ground crops as cover crops are a
[SPEAKER_00]: great thing to incorporate as part of a
rotation to keep a healthy soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into some cover crop
options for field production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, just what is a cover crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in general, cover crops are any type
of plant that's used to protect and
[SPEAKER_00]: improve the soil and environment for the
next farming season.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does not mean weeds fall into this
category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using cover crop mimics nature and keeps
your ecosystem thriving through the off
[SPEAKER_00]: season with roots present in the soil,
helping that soil biology to continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: live, giving earthworms a sense of area to
kind of feed off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, cover crops are a great thing to
implement to really any production field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often would be recommended here with
cannabis because it may not get the
[SPEAKER_00]: attention that it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the benefits of cover
crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they prevent erosion, sequester
nutrients, reduce soil compaction,
[SPEAKER_00]: suppress weed growth, weeds that at least
you don't want, and then repel unwanted
[SPEAKER_00]: pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also provide a habitat for
beneficial organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a lot of advantages to taking
the time to go through and ensure that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're planting and establishing a quality
cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question is, okay,
if I want to go through and do a cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, what's the best cover crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it often depends on a few factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: What climate are you growing in?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the duration of growth that you
have?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what benefits the grower they're
seeking?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that field may need improvement
on?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what determines what, quote,
the best cover crop would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some common cover crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: We see kind of a nice image set here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cover these going rye, triticale,
winter wheat, clover, mustards,
[SPEAKER_00]: hairy vetch, tillage, radish, sorghum,
Sudan grass, buckwheat, and there's also
[SPEAKER_00]: blends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, rye, triticale, and winter
wheat, as we can see them kind of pictured
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rye is very common in colder climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can germinate in temperatures that are
just above freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does take a little time, but it will
still germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces a fibrous root system that can
reduce soil erosion and can really grow
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressively in the early spring if
conditions are favorable, although it may
[SPEAKER_00]: require some mowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the quickest to mature out of the
comparison list provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triticale is similar benefits to rye,
but does not grow as aggressively as rye
[SPEAKER_00]: in the early spring, making management of
triticale much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers will provide triticale
over rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply, there's less biomass to have to
deal with in the early spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also holds its feed value better,
triticale, than rye, into late spring for
[SPEAKER_00]: grazing or making it into hay or silage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why a lot of people will choose
triticale over just your common winter
[SPEAKER_00]: rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, there's winter wheat, which is
common in Southern Plains region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best if used for grazing or for grain as
what its main purpose is for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now clover, within clover, there's many
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, clover is a low growing and
can fix nitrogen from the air,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it should be inoculated with
rhizobacteria to allow for maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's crimson clover, which is good for
under seeding and easily killed by tilling
[SPEAKER_00]: or low mowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's red clover, which
performs best where corn does well,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, at the bottom here, there's white
clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be invasive as it can survive being
tilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, invasive necessarily a bad thing
in the sense that it'll spread everywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a mint, for example, but keep that in
mind, this can survive some tilling
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's mustard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mustard is a biofumigant for control of
soil fungi and nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kodiak mustard is known for its high
biomass, about four to five tons per acre,
[SPEAKER_00]: and soil fumigation properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of an example of what that
will look like when it's in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers should mow before plants set seed
and incorporate into the soil immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: to have best effect for soil pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty much when it flowers,
when you want to cut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of the image right below me here
is that perfect time when to cut it,
[SPEAKER_00]: mow it, and till it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: With proper management, this crop may be
used as an organic replacement for
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical-based fumigants, such as methyl
bromide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at 18 pounds to the acre, or an average
of 180,000 seeds per pound, just to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you an idea, in very small seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hairy vetch fixes large amounts of
nitrogen from the air, which can help meet
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen needs of the following crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great advantage of hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we want you to keep in mind that
in the field, it should be kept in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field, I should say, and growing until the
purple flowers start to form, which can
[SPEAKER_00]: take longer than other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the purple flowers that we see in
the image here, this is the sign it's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of reached its maximum effectiveness,
and it should be killed at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: With mid-August planting, peak nitrogen
concentration will typically not occur
[SPEAKER_00]: until late May.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, this cover crop needs a
long duration of time, longer than some
[SPEAKER_00]: other cover crops, making it not the best
choice for some growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in addition, it does protect the
soil from erosion, in addition to its
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen-fixing properties, can improve
soil tillage, and provides weed control
[SPEAKER_00]: during the vigorous growth in the spring,
and when left as a dead mulch on the soil
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there are some advantages to
using hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hairy vetch can also be grazed or
harvested as forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research has shown that hairy vetch mulch
can also increase main crop disease
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant for prolonged leaf
photosynthesis, the following crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also been utilized to help suppress
fusarium in some watermelon plantings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind though, if you do let it go
to seed as a warning, the nice vines that
[SPEAKER_00]: you see here will almost become like rope
and can make control of this cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you get it just at the time
pictured here, it will be able to be
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stems are relatively weak,
but it doesn't take long after those
[SPEAKER_00]: purple flowers start to kind of mature and
produce seeds, that these nice little
[SPEAKER_00]: supple vines initially will go right to
basically what looks like rope.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also gaining popularity something
called tillage radish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tillage radish can be used to what's
called biotilla field.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants produce large taproot,
as we can see here and here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can penetrate through compacted
layers and alleviate soil compaction down
[SPEAKER_00]: eight inches or sometimes even greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: The radishes decompose quickly in the
spring, leaving large holes in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, upon decomposition, there can be
a foul odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watch planting densities and proximity
of your neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: When broadcast use eight to 10 pounds per
acre of tillage radish.
[SPEAKER_00]: They suggested to precision plant or drill
with eight to 15 inch row spacing,
[SPEAKER_00]: as this will reduce the seedling rates to
half.
[SPEAKER_00]: The broadcast rate and to be getting the
maximum amount of tillage, biotillage,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say effectiveness from this
particular radish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's sorghum Sudan grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sorghum Sudan grass, it's tall grows
five to 12 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very fast growing, heat loving summer
annual grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very similar to growing a corn plant,
simply it doesn't produce an ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can smother weeds, suppress some
nematode species and penetrate compacted
[SPEAKER_00]: subsoil if it is mowed once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed cost is modest.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, growers need to be sure they have
the equipment to handle the massive amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of biomass that's produced here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it grows very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get out of hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure if you are planting this,
you do have the proper equipment to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to control it when it does reach its
peak biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see buckwheat in the images
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It offers a lot of advantages in the sense
that it's a fast germinator and grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dense canopy smothers annual weeds,
protects the soil from erosion,
[SPEAKER_00]: helps conserve soil moisture and attracts
pollinators and beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: When buckwheat residues return to the
soil, the phosphorus becomes available for
[SPEAKER_00]: the next crop if phosphorus is an issue in
your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are easy to control and should be
cut down shortly after flowering to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: reseeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, even if it's seeds, produces
seeds, it's not usually a major issue due
[SPEAKER_00]: to the benefits and ease of controlling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be applied at about two pounds per
thousand square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed is also kind of unique in the
sense it's kind of like a pyramidal shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, growers get all concerned
about, oh, it's finally to killed
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to take advantage of some of those
pollinators, you can let it produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have it come back, but usually not
that aggressively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it does come back, it usually can
be pretty easily controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to cover crop blends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often recommended or required in some
cases, the goals provide multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see kind of that mix of seed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there tends to be a dominant
species or two and others kind of get out
[SPEAKER_00]: competed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind having a cover crop blend
of 20 different species may not end up
[SPEAKER_00]: with 20 species in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some recommend 12 different species,
but this can be a little excessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically blends of three or so species is
advised to kind of target the particular
[SPEAKER_00]: soil type or climate that you're dealing
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some common blends are 50% winter rye and
40% winter oats and 10% hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that at a rate of seven to 10 pounds
per thousand square feet or 75% winter
[SPEAKER_00]: rye, 25% hairy vetch, so about five pounds
per thousand, about 1,250 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's many, many more options.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you are looking at spreading
these, we see the blends here.
[SPEAKER_00]: See a nice allocation of winter rye and
vetch cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's your winter rye seed,
here's your vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different shapes of the seeds,
are different sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may impact how you're able to
effectively spread that over a field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, fertilizing your cover crop simply is
not advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people want a really strong
cover crop, they want to fertilize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really it's not advised that cover crop
can be a little quote hungry, can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little nutrient deficient, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just looking at it establishing
itself to get some of those benefits and
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain roots growing in your particular
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, it's a great resource to kind of
look at and also a free resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be this kind of managing cover
crop profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would give you a link to the PDF here,
download it, take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some of the many and extensive
options that exist to ensure you're
[SPEAKER_00]: picking the best cover crop to fit your
conditions.
