[SPEAKER_00]: As the title suggests, we're going to be
looking at the animal phylum Arthropoda.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just kind of put this here to help
you get to remember how to pronounce the
[SPEAKER_00]: proper term there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see some species located
within this phylum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what makes this particular phylum
unique is the advent of jointed
[SPEAKER_00]: appendages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is the most successful of all the
animal groups, and these jointed
[SPEAKER_00]: appendages are one of the key
distinguishing factors for this phylum.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, there's also
exoskeleton made of chitin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The muscles attach on the inside of this
outer shell, as we see here, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: outer shell made of chitin protects
against predators and also water loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that evident right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very hard type structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now chitin cannot support much weight,
so that results in a limiting of these
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals' total size.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have segments, three in particular,
that often fuse into functional groups
[SPEAKER_00]: when the animal reaches the adult stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three segments are the abdomen,
the thorax, and the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are also important to be able to
identify on these particular animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do dissections of or we want to
refer to a specific region, these are the
[SPEAKER_00]: three regions, the head, the thorax,
and the abdomen you should be familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's certain subsets within this
phylum that lack jaws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cholesterol is one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just simply, they might have
mouth parts, but they lack jaws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spiders, mites, scorpions, and horseshoe
crabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horseshoe crabs are interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have fossil records going back about
630 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the only surviving type of this
particular arthropoda.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're found, again, they're not
extremely rare, found in pretty high
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers along the beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: In June in Long Island Sound is when they
can come in and they tend to group
[SPEAKER_00]: together when they're mating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can be one to be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have one hanging on the walls of a
preserved specimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now isn't that true for all arthropoda?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have actual mouth parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call those jaws properly termed
mandibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that in the human here highlighted
in green.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see that in the ant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These insects, centipedes, millipedes,
have these mandibles which are specialized
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth parts or jaws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might be a little bit of a shocker of a
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our arachnids, they have four pairs of
walking legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these two actually are not used
for walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just more for feeling,
for gathering food items, for moving
[SPEAKER_00]: things, but not specifically for walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within the arachnid species,
there's about 57,000 named species within
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just classify them as spiders and
kind of clump them in that category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's ticks and mites and daddy
long legs and scorpions and spiders all
[SPEAKER_00]: lumped into this same group of arachnids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within these arachnids, among the first to
live on land go in from water to air
[SPEAKER_00]: breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scorpions are thought to be one of the
first to make that transition from the
[SPEAKER_00]: water environment to the land environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason is their lungs have a strong
resemblance of king crab gills,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly something called the book
lung.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever opened the shell of a crab,
you see the lungs or gills really here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very similar to king crabs,
gills, and that's the lungs of a scorpion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lungs are specifically called book
lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called book because they kind of
look like the pages of a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is creating a high surface area,
a lot of efficient exchange of oxygen and
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: These crustaceans comprise of a diverse
group of mandibles, about 35,000 species
[SPEAKER_00]: such as crab, shrimp, lobster,
crayfish, and pill bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some can be really small and
some can be quite large.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all under this same general
classification here, but we can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity that does exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now most crustaceans have two pairs of
antennae, three pairs of chewing
[SPEAKER_00]: appendages and various number of legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may remember from one of my previous
videos, the importance of knowing your
[SPEAKER_00]: orientation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dorsal view is looking kind of from
the top down here, the back to the animal,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ventral is at underside of that belly
region, and here's the side view.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can require you to know all the
individual segments here, but again,
[SPEAKER_00]: could be advantageous for identification
purposes if we do a dissection of a
[SPEAKER_00]: crustacean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crustaceans just living in New England,
I want to point out some key items here
[SPEAKER_00]: with our lobster.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may think of a lobster in New England
and the Maine or American lobster here
[SPEAKER_00]: with its large claws.
[SPEAKER_00]: For most of the world though, the
Caribbean or spiny lobster is what most
[SPEAKER_00]: people think of when they hear the term
lobster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what makes the Maine or American
lobster so desired all over the world is
[SPEAKER_00]: its large claws, the meat in its claws.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the Caribbean or spiny lobster
has a good tail meat region, but not
[SPEAKER_00]: really anything great in the claw region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Millipedes and centipedes, I just want to
highlight some differences between these
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Millipedes and centipedes have bodies that
consist of head region, followed by
[SPEAKER_00]: numerous segments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our centipede and here's our
millipede.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice immediately there's some
very key differences between the two,
[SPEAKER_00]: and being able to identify the difference
between the two is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go over some of the key things to
look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Centipedes have one pair of legs per
segment, while millipedes have two legs
[SPEAKER_00]: per segment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, centipedes tend to be carnivorous,
meaning they eat, in this case this one's
[SPEAKER_00]: eating sadly a mouse that got caught in
the trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Millipedes are herbivores, and they eat
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ever have the option,
if you want to be put into a tank of
[SPEAKER_00]: millipedes or centipedes, despite the more
legs, I'd go with millipedes because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to be looking for a plant to
eat and not want to take a bite out of
[SPEAKER_00]: you, like a centipede may.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we have our insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the largest group.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the most abundant eukaryotes on
earth, and insects have those three
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctive regions that I talked about,
the abdomen, the thorax, and the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're the most diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what makes the reason why this
particular phylum is considered to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: most successful if you're looking at
number of species, simply because of
[SPEAKER_00]: insects are the most abundant eukaryotes
on earth.
