[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you have the best controller,
where you place the CO2 sensor is
[SPEAKER_00]: important for the function of your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a sensor we see like right here,
wired system goes right to a controller
[SPEAKER_00]: box, but where you place that in your grow
facility is important to ensure that the
[SPEAKER_00]: controller can work as efficiently as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to remember that carbon
dioxide will sink because it's heavier
[SPEAKER_00]: than air, so it naturally wants to go to
the bottom of a grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some growers like to inject it over
their plants, kind of at the top,
[SPEAKER_00]: and let it kind of work its way through
the plants as it will naturally fall
[SPEAKER_00]: through a system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also important to keep in mind
when you're looking at mounting or placing
[SPEAKER_00]: your sensor in a grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sensor placement is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you place your sensor is important
to ensure the proper evaluation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, the sensor is only going to be
as good as where you place it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be aware of exhaust systems, as I have
here a carbon filter for exhaust,
[SPEAKER_00]: the points of injection and the tubing
here, air circulation such as the fan,
[SPEAKER_00]: or other fans that you may have in the
positioning of the plants and how they may
[SPEAKER_00]: impact certain aspects of the carbon
dioxide and air in general environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while there's a whole bunch of
different situations, I'm trying to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you the main idea here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ideally a sensor should be above the
point or points of injection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this tubing comes down here and
runs through here, is where my CO2 is
[SPEAKER_00]: injected.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, my sensor is placed above
that, meaning because CO2 is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: sink, it should fill up this area and this
will kind of give me the assessment above
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it below here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as CO2 starts injecting,
it might get a false reading because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the CO2 naturally falling by the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want the sensor below your
ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, my ventilation's at the
top here to help exhaust the hot air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, I don't want to put it
above that because if that's pulling out
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2, I don't want it to be trying to fill
the entire grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also you want it generally at plant
heights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chose to kind of with the upper portion
of plant height here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's also an important consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also may want it in an area where it's
getting some fed or some mixing after the
[SPEAKER_00]: fan or circulation that you have in the
grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while each is unique, these are some
general ideas to keep in mind to ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: that your carbon dioxide sensor is
accurately placed to allow efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: enrichment of your grow space with carbon
dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
