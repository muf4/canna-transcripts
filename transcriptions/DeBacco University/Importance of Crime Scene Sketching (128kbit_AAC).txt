[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to go over the importance
of crime scene sketching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the importance of being able to
sketch a crime scene?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're essential documents in the
step within the processing protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be able to sketch a crime
scene or what's going on with the objects
[SPEAKER_00]: that you may have photographed,
what's going on in that room or that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be sure you're including,
which means you also need to take these
[SPEAKER_00]: dimensions, distance, content,
and relationship of items of evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these things must be taken into
account while you're there at the crime
[SPEAKER_00]: scene so you can generate a quality sketch
that will uphold in court.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, sketches versus photographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: While many may think photographs are the
most important item, sketches can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: show more comprehensive view of the crime
scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see an example here of kind of
one level of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photographs, I'm going to take into
account a portion of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives us a larger perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sketches should be supplements to
photographs in order to provide a
[SPEAKER_00]: comprehensive description of the crime
scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we may be looking at the table
here, this sketch is going to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: context to that photograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they kind of go hand in hand,
but keep in mind the sketches are very
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This includes a lot of those essential
elements, also including the direction of
[SPEAKER_00]: north.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also important consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the purpose of the sketch, to document
the exact location and relationship of
[SPEAKER_00]: physical items in the crime scene,
provide a permanent record of those
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here more sketches and more
dimensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to relate to the sequence of
events that may have occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in court settings, sketches help
prosecutors, judges, and the jury
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the crime scene by providing an
overall view of the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind these people very likely have
never been there and are relying on you to
[SPEAKER_00]: supply them with information.
[SPEAKER_00]: These lines here show doors, and it shows
the way that doors open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that knowing which way the
doors open can also be important when
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at angles of attackers or
potentially bullet trajectory can also
[SPEAKER_00]: something to take into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now sketching procedure, you want to
observe the entire crime scene kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: unbiasedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to outline area dimensions of the
room or rooms if you're sketching more
[SPEAKER_00]: than one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Draw objects and evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measure distances, record all details,
and add details such as a legend,
[SPEAKER_00]: title, scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Direction of north is also very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start with the blank sheet,
and you have to not only know you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be documenting all this, and a sketch,
but taking all of these into consideration
[SPEAKER_00]: while you're actively there at the crime
scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: General sketch notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of see a nice little example
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at, this is not to scale,
but do not measure through space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oddly shaped items such as puddles or
liquids are triangulated from the center
[SPEAKER_00]: of mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not cross measurement lines and always
have the sketch verified by someone other
[SPEAKER_00]: than yourself that was also there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at, you know, a place where
we're not having any lines crossed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're documenting sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the entry and exit door,
so indicating there's no other doors,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there is a window here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of information is easily provided
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to all these letters,
here's the legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the title block.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's who it was sketched by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note it's not to scale, and also the
direction of north.
[SPEAKER_00]: So types of sketches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example here would be a rough sketch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is kind of when you want to just start
with crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a finished product or polished
product, but it does contain measurements
[SPEAKER_00]: and other data, as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now within this rough sketch, we're
looking at, should show the proportions
[SPEAKER_00]: with accurate measurements, but does not
need to be to scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is speaking particularly to the
rough sketch.
[SPEAKER_00]: No changes should be made once you leave
the crime scene, and it requires a legend
[SPEAKER_00]: or a key.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something you're actually making
while you're actively there at the crime
[SPEAKER_00]: scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lying to ensure you have all the correct
measurements, you have all the basic
[SPEAKER_00]: information that you need, and a legend to
know what you found and where it was
[SPEAKER_00]: found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rough sketch specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see some more of the specifics
indicated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Audits should be marked with letters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evidence marked by a circled number,
and those should correspond with the
[SPEAKER_00]: photographs you've also taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: North is also indicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we have south, east,
north, and west also indicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically you just need to indicate north.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most relevant materials are documented and
typically done with pencil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see which way the doors are
opening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have the date marked as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a finished sketch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how does this different than a
finished sketch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a finished sketch shows the proper
relationships and scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: The finished sketch is more presentable
for court presentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be professionally produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: This finished sketch, in addition,
will omit measurement lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: All items in the rough sketch must be
included with no editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move myself over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note scale notations.
[SPEAKER_00]: All measurements should be oriented in the
same direction for easy reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the kitchen, the
countertop, reference points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's in that same orientation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Airheads should touch measurement lines if
you are using those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hidden objects should be indicated by
dotted lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: No conclusions should be noted on the
drawings.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an image of just what was
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Objects located by triangulation when
possible, and the numbers should match
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers that are on the photographs as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, north needs to be indicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can indicate the other cardinal
directions as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure you're including the legend,
time, person, and if it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to look at a picture
of two sketches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our finished sketch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how it would look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have a sketch here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we notice the details of
triangulation, measurements included
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere, the level of detail that's
presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though this is a rough sketch,
it is providing a lot of detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And information.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be included as the evidence and
would potentially uphold a court.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a lot of times to simplify
things, we might take the same image and
[SPEAKER_00]: simplify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we have the image here,
a little simplified with the legends still
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw the couch, the desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here we're kind of omitting some
details.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to maybe if we're
looking at just highlighting one
[SPEAKER_00]: particular object, we can simplify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to have this also included as
part of evidence because this is showing
[SPEAKER_00]: where the door is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is showing a lot more detail,
a lot more measurements, a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: information than the one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do see that it is incident reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the location, who it's verified by,
and the cardinal direction north.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep in mind that when we are
sketching things, it's very important to
[SPEAKER_00]: sketch them well and include the
information needed while we're there at
[SPEAKER_00]: the crime scene so we can have an accurate
portrayal of that information that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: upheld in the court of law.
