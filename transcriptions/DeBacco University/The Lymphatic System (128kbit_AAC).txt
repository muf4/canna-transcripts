[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we're going to do a brief overview
of the lymphatic system, which if we look
[SPEAKER_00]: at this image, it does have a lot of at
least visual similarities to the general
[SPEAKER_00]: circulatory system of our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does work in close proximity with
our circulatory system as well as our
[SPEAKER_00]: immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving on, so the lymphatic system
recovering lost fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is this kind of referring to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the cardiovascular system is
actually very leaky.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process of moving blood and going
through capillaries actually creates some
[SPEAKER_00]: loss of some fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal of the lymphatic system is to
collect and recycle leaked fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body uses a secondary circulatory
system called the lymphatic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can think of the reason why it
looks so similar to the circulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we can see with our capillaries
here, it's in very close proximity to that
[SPEAKER_00]: circulatory system as a way to kind of
recycle and collect leaked fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three main functions of the
lymphatic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is returns proteins to circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we're moving things through our
capillaries and things are diffusing
[SPEAKER_00]: across, we want to make sure returning
proteins are not lost outside the
[SPEAKER_00]: circulatory system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to bring them back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if proteins are not returned to
the blood, we have a condition here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is kind of stage one,
stage two, stage three, and extreme stage
[SPEAKER_00]: four here called edema.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is body swelling will ultimately
result if we have this accumulation of
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins and not returning them via the
lymphatic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blood pressure forces fluid out of the
capillary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why does this occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, most of the interstitial fluid
returns by osmosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, excessive fluid is drained into
the lymphatic system capillaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the lymphatic system, this fluid is
called lymph.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lymph nodes, the lymphatic system,
transport lymph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the vessels here contain a series of
one-way valves, and they permit movement
[SPEAKER_00]: only in one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's kind of our arteries and our
veins and our interstitial space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see things moving out, things
moving in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows the actual change in pressure
gradient at the capillary level.
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers represent the pressure of the
vesicles in millimeters of mercury,
[SPEAKER_00]: mm of Hg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what the unit is for these
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the arrows in the diagram show the
magnitude and the direction of the net
[SPEAKER_00]: movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can take a look at that and
clearly see our artery pressure is 37 mm
[SPEAKER_00]: of mercury.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the manual here is 17 millimeters of
mercury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going on to the second function here,
the lymphatic system transports fats
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed from the intestines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, lymph capillaries, so you hear
typically in the green color here,
[SPEAKER_00]: are called lacteals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This absorbs fats from the small
intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember back, remember that our
intestines have a very high surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do this with our villi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is increasing the surface here
for nutrient exchange, particularly for
[SPEAKER_00]: the intestines' nutrient absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see here our lymphatic system is
working in close proximity there,
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbing fats from the small intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number three, our last function of the
lymphatic system that we're going to focus
[SPEAKER_00]: on is aids in the body's defenses,
which is the immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lymph nodes are filled with white blood
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three particular areas of importance are
tonsils, you can see up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They contain many T and B cells and
inflamed in response to an infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spleen, located here, contains T
cells, B cells, and macrophages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our thalamus right here in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important during field development in
childhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time you reach puberty,
the immune system is mature and the role
[SPEAKER_00]: of the thalamus is reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not to zero, but it is reduced at
that later stages in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now tonsillectomy, if you may have had
this, may be wondering or a little
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned, going back for one second,
that if tonsils contain T and B cells and
[SPEAKER_00]: is important, may inflame in response to
an infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had those removed, would that be a
negative impact on us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, connecting these two with the immune
system, it's reasonable to say that there
[SPEAKER_00]: is enough evidence to conclude that
tonsillectomies has no clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: significant negative effect on the immune
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Provided a link to the article here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what infected or inflamed tonsils
will look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have kind of that whitish spots
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the representative image of a
normal and our abnormal or inflamed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This quote in this article was based on a
total of somewhere in 35 articles,
[SPEAKER_00]: including almost 2,000 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they came to the conclusion that
there's no clinical significant negative
[SPEAKER_00]: effects on the immune system if you've had
your tonsils removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a brief overview of the lymphatic
system here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to look at another video,
this is a Crash Course video, they tie in
[SPEAKER_00]: the lymphatic system to airport screening
analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also goes over regulating blood volume,
maintaining blood pressure, improvement
[SPEAKER_00]: with the immune system, and is the
appendix really useless?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're welcome to check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, hopefully you found this
video helpful.
Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
