[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I have another video on going over
the basics of population pyramids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is involved in interpreting them,
considering these main six categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Percent of dependents that are
economically active, birth rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: death rate, infant mortality, life
expectancy, and migration.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these play into how a population
pyramid can be used to help predict the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to interpret some of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the importance of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So importance of population pyramids at
the local level, for policy planning,
[SPEAKER_00]: future housing estates, future schools,
future jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a town of Rocky Hill, historic
populations based on consensus records.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll notice here back in 1850 to about
1930, very stable, very low, and then this
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid increase, this exponential increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at more current terms from 2009 to
2014, we're looking at the median house
[SPEAKER_00]: price on the count of home sales per
quarter, and the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the number and the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can help us indicate trends of
what may occur, whether homes are cheaper,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they're expensive, whether they're
trending up or trending down.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these are involved with population
pyramids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're useful to help track birth
rate, death rate, infant mortality,
[SPEAKER_00]: and life expectancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at a couple that are
looking more at the large scale at the
[SPEAKER_00]: country level, like a country of Germany,
United States, Finland, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also be applied to a local level
if you have that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if more homes for elderly
are needed, if there's an aging
[SPEAKER_00]: population, or fewer schools if there's a
declining birth rate, these are,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, ways to consider shifts that should
be made to a respective town.
[SPEAKER_00]: World population distribution,
urban versus rural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, urban plus rural have to equal
100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're noticing a slow increase or
predicted increase in the urban
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and a decrease in the rural
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our births per thousand, again,
Africa being at the elevated level here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So population pyramids are useful because
they show the effects of people migrating
[SPEAKER_00]: into and out of a region or a country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Population per square mile is Louisiana
and how things may change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The portion of a population who are
economically active and the portion who
[SPEAKER_00]: are dependent on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dependency ratio can also impact that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click this world population clock kind of
a little scary on how rapidly increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: overall the world's population is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you remember back from some of the
slides, one of the previous videos,
[SPEAKER_00]: this gives some examples of what an
expanding pyramid may look like,
[SPEAKER_00]: a negative growth and a stable growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the presence here expanding,
very high young population, sadly very low
[SPEAKER_00]: life expectancy, negative growth rate,
not a lot of young dependents,
[SPEAKER_00]: and stable relatively consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's consistent from age 60 and below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll look at Italy in particular here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember we have our males here and our
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look specifically at this
population and how things may change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll link here to some of where I get
this information from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it presents a really great way and
helps you interpret these population
[SPEAKER_00]: pyramids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Italy in 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have to remember we have our
different regions that we want to take
[SPEAKER_00]: into account.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be looking back at some of the
previous videos to help explain what these
[SPEAKER_00]: may show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This graph in particular stops at 80 plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the population over 80 years
old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to look at these specific regions,
we're looking at a declining birth rate
[SPEAKER_00]: here in this where variant one's pointing
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're two weeks into the cold of baby
boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the expanding population here in
this particular age group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, we're noticing fewer men due to
World War I and World War II compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the reason for the less
percentage of males versus females in this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular age group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And number five here, more 75 to 79 year
olds than zero to four year olds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is a science for the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: The worker shortage and overall declining
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also comparing different regions of this
population pyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: An aging population and a declining birth
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things to consider here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in general what's occurring in
Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking back, going back to our
population pyramid for Italy in 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: See this graph that we analyzed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we want to look and see how this may
change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a prediction of the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this is the population in 2000,
this is its predicted B in 2025.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll notice, let's flip back for a
second, we're noticing this change and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why I kept everything the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, 2000, 2025, 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flipping back, we're noticing this region
here is working its way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 2000, 2025.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's that population that shifted up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're making the inference that there
won't be as high percentage of birth rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we go back to the data we have
for 2000, we're noticing a negative
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will only get worse as we go into
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, it's declining birth rate in
this large expanse of the older aging
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Netherlands, this kind of shows you
it looking over a little bit of a longer
[SPEAKER_00]: term.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how this population is working
its way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from 1950 to 60, every 10 year
increments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This initial boom here working its way
through the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just gives you an idea of how these
pyramids can be used to help predict the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Population pyramids have different scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to look at the one in particular
that you may be comparing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A particular country, state, or the
county, different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it can be at this town level,
the state level, at the country level,
[SPEAKER_00]: the continent level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be mindful of the scales that you're
looking at for the particular pyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's United States of America in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see here's Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a very large state level,
or the United States level I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going down to the state level
here, in particular looking at Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now within Alaska, we're looking at a
small area within Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot more specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's a major shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, these are all people of Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're looking at this level,
we see a major shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: A major difference compared to what Alaska
in general looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alaska also looks different than just the
United States in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So broad, a little bit more specific,
and very specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a major shift in males between the
ages of 35 and 39.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well this particular area, it's located
right here on the Aleutians.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've seen maybe the show Deadly
Sketch, lots of fishing industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tends to be more of a male dominated job
occupation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very physically demanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, this area tends to have a
greater percentage of male population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go back to that population pyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing 35 to 39 year olds able to
work, able to handle the demands and
[SPEAKER_00]: rigors of, in this case, crabbing or
fishing may require.
[SPEAKER_00]: Human populations, throughout most of
history, human populations have been
[SPEAKER_00]: raised by food availability, by food
access to an area, disease that may occur,
[SPEAKER_00]: and predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps regulate the human population.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2,000 years ago, human population was
about 130 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took 1,000 years for it to double,
and another 650 for it to double again.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, starting in the 1700s,
technological changes gave humans more
[SPEAKER_00]: control over their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: No longer were hunter gatherers,
using more sophisticated ways to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: food.
[SPEAKER_00]: These changes allowed human expansion to
expand the carrying capacity of their
[SPEAKER_00]: habitats, leading to this basic rapid and
extremely rapid increase overall in
[SPEAKER_00]: population because of some of these
advances that we were able to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: No longer hunting and searching for food,
able to keep a controlled environment and
[SPEAKER_00]: be very productive in a very small area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Human populations, currently human
populations generate about 1.3% annually.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doubling time is only about 54 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can be a little bit scary when we
get into this exponential curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember from one of the previous videos,
exponential curves tend to reach some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of carrying capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, we have no indication that
there's carrying capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, human population growth is not
uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at the United States of Alaska
and a specific town in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, our human population growth is
different in different regions of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an expansion or prediction of
what's going to happen in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that carrying capacity,
this should eventually taper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where that's going to occur is still
unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great video link if you're looking at
population pyramids and predicting the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about a five minute video I
recommend that you watch.
