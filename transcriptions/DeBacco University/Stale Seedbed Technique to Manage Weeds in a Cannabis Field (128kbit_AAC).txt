[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to be looking at the sterile
[SPEAKER_00]: seedbed technique, which is a technique
used to manage weeds on a large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: field, as we can see here in practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the sterile
seedbed technique to manage weeds in a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what does this technique
involve?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this technique is based on allowing
weed seeds just below the soil surface to
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate and then are killed prior to
planting the cash crop while minimizing
[SPEAKER_00]: soil disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weeds which germinate and emerge before
the crop is planted are simply easier to
[SPEAKER_00]: manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this process can be overlooked,
it can be very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're seeing here is we have our
seedbed preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're allowing some certain weed seeds
then to kind of germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kill those off and then by not tilling
the soil, that mixing everything up,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're keeping our weed seeds down below
where they can germinate and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing our intended crop to go through
and be the one to grow with less weed
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this basic process is cultivating the
soil, promotes weed seed germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the total amount of weed seeds present,
a small percentage are non-dormant and
[SPEAKER_00]: able to germinate really at any given
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can be the quick ones and the first
ones to emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most weeds only emerge from seeds in the
top kind of shallow layer, about top two
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half inches or so of soil and most
typically emerge only in significant
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers from the top one inch of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sterile seedbed technique works by
targeting weed seeds in this shallow
[SPEAKER_00]: layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reason why seeds can germinate in this
shallow area is some of them are actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: have photoreceptors, are actually light
sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they know if they're in that top inch,
they're getting some sunlight exposure
[SPEAKER_00]: that's gonna signal them to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're down below that where it's
completely dark all the time, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna remain dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go through and till them up,
well then it will start to emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are the weeds killed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, ideally our practices that minimize
soil disturbance because deep tailing the
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds will not only bring up more weed
seeds to the surface and essentially go
[SPEAKER_00]: against the basis for this technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examples include and often preferred will
be herbicide application, a weed flamer,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can be very effective, shallow
rotary cultivation or simply a hoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see all of these methods can
all be incorporated as part of this
technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not use this technique after
talking about all the good things about
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, while this technique can be
effective, if you have the following
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, the weed control percentage
may not be as high as you would like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weeds are lengthily emergent periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: They germinate over a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the soil conditions such as moisture
and temperature impacting weed emergence,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly dry conditions may not allow
for weeds to germinate as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unable to implement weed control when crop
is growing as this can restrict multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: weed germination periods and also control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have these particular
situations, this may not be the best
[SPEAKER_00]: method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I want to caution you to just
commit to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at these conditions,
they're very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Committing your area may not be the best
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timing the sterile seedbed technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, timing is kind of important with
this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sterile seedbed technique can be
initiated several days, weeks or months
[SPEAKER_00]: prior to seeding or transplanting the
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply put, the goal is to kind of let
those weeds germinate that are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface, kind of kill those weeds off,
let a couple more germinate, kill those
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds off without doing a massive
disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the further ahead you can do this
ahead of the crop, the more likely you are
[SPEAKER_00]: to germinate the weed seeds and remove
those to give your chosen crop a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of a head start before it starts
shading out hopefully the soil there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives you just a little background
here of the sterile seedbed technique.
