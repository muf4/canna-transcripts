[SPEAKER_00]: All right, welcome to this tobacco
university video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be investigating
self-crosses compared to out-crossing in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a scientific research study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be presenting some data
along with some pictures to help you
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the differences between these
two and how they impact cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the research article that
I pulled the information from,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could see the abstract listed here,
a link and sources cited here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to give you a general
summary of this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we'll have to define what
kind of out-crossing and self-crossing is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes self-crossing is simply
referred to as selfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an out-cross, let's start there,
is when two unrelated or at least
[SPEAKER_00]: distantly related plants are bred or
crossed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The out-crossing increases the genetic
variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that here, you have
different individuals mixing up the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to self-crossing, this is when
the maternal and pollen from the parents
[SPEAKER_00]: are the same genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to reduce the potential for
genetic variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is different than cloning,
which is an asexual form of vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that selfing or
self-crossing is not the same as cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's reducing the genetic variability
where cloning is almost an identical copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's little different procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're just reducing the
chance at variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when is selfing used in particular?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for hemp, feminized seed producers
often use selfing to maintain a strain
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process of selfing a cannabis plant
may lead to inferior plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol or CBD production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what we're looking at
here is, yes, we're using this maybe to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain a strain name, but is that also
going to reduce or negatively impact CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: production?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at the self versus
out-crossing kind of examples here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and here we can see some great images.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the selfed progeny here were
significantly smaller than out-crossed
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny for all measured traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we just look at the image
here, letter A and letter B being
[SPEAKER_00]: out-crosses, and here letter C
representing self-crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see a stark difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the study goes on to say that the
selfed progeny here compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: out-crossed was about half of the height,
had fewer internodes, reduced internode
[SPEAKER_00]: length, half the leaf area, half the total
dry weight, delayed by seven days in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower development, 36% less floral dry
weight, equal CBD producers, both met the
[SPEAKER_00]: legal limit of 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just note that while there is these
stark differences is a limit with any
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific study, there's always some sort
of limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this one, it is that the study was
only looking at three strains and the
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny of three crosses were evaluated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking, we saw the stark differences
there, but now if we kind of look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers, we're kind of looking at the
vegetative and flower growth in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: These findings provide the phenotypic and
genotypic data to support that selfing in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis induces inbreeding depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while there's a lot of numbers here and
you're welcome to pause the video and take
[SPEAKER_00]: a look at it, I want to just make note
that this first column and the second
[SPEAKER_00]: column represent the out-crosses and this
last column represent the selfed crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with letters of the same name,
we're having basically no statistical
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the out-crosses pretty much A's
and just a couple B's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all the self-crosses, we see the B's
and the C's indicating that there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at this by the Fisher's least
significant difference with a p-value less
[SPEAKER_00]: than or equal to 0.05.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, looking at some statistics
supports what we saw there with the large
[SPEAKER_00]: images or phenotypes of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what was also noticed in this research
study is that all self-progeny exhibited
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf variegation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is known to be a recessive genetic
trait in higher plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that again indicates that there's
probably an accumulation of these
[SPEAKER_00]: recessive genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Variegation was first evident at the
cotyledon growth stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see that here, cotyledons
remember are the seed leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: For most plants, the variegation persisted
through day 35.
[SPEAKER_00]: And however, three plants had variegated
leaves until the end of the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be a prolonged effect there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now self in cannabis induces inbreeding
depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So evidence of inbreeding depression in
selfed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, selfed feminized seed has less
vigorous plants and reduced yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased homozygosity with negative or
recessive traits such as variegation
[SPEAKER_00]: observed, which suggests inbreeding may
occur more rapidly in hemp than other
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just shows an example here of
potential corn plants were saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced height there, that inbreeding
depression does occur in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this study at least indicates it may
occur a little quicker in hemp crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at crossing different
strains can increase yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crossing two different strains to maintain
or increase heterozygosity could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy to increase yields and plants may
be more uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: If crossing within a strain is necessary,
growers should consider using two
[SPEAKER_00]: different genotypes of the strain to
produce feminized seed and maintain the
[SPEAKER_00]: strain name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a little kind of indication there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what are looking at as far as like if
you're a grower, how does this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: relate?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you kind of apply this
information?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hemp breeders may want to consider
developing inbred parental lines to
[SPEAKER_00]: generate F1 feminized seed, which could
produce plants that exhibit improved crop
[SPEAKER_00]: uniformity and hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be beneficial for feminized seed
producers to use out crossing instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: selfing to generate feminized seed for CBD
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of just a general overview
here looking at hemp compared to self
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing and out crossing.
