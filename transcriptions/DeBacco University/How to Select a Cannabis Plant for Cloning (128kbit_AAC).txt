[SPEAKER_00]: All right, in this Tobacco University
video, I'm going to go over how to select
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant for cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while individual growers or breeding
styles may differ, I'm going to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: some general ideas or points to consider
when you're going about selecting a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant for cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into this Tobacco
University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, what should you be
looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And different growers may have different
targets, but you want to be considering
[SPEAKER_00]: the morphology, how the plant actually
looks, the timing, some of the genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: that that plant may have, and also the
chemical profiles that it might be
[SPEAKER_00]: producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll talk about each of these in brief
detail here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, this is referring to the plant
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be aware that this does not always hold
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be impacted by the environment
the plants are growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a plant gets more fertilizer than
another, this could impact its morphology,
[SPEAKER_00]: could cause it to stretch more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have to be more compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just, again, keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why documentation of how you
grow and your growing procedure is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're only growing a few plants,
this may make the selection process harder
[SPEAKER_00]: to find that true standout that might have
a very unique morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it very spacey?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it more normal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it very compact?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just things to consider there when we're
looking at a plant's morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: The timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about timing,
we can talk about the speed it takes for
[SPEAKER_00]: it to produce flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers look for plants that produce
pre-flowers quicker, looking for that
[SPEAKER_00]: quicker turnaround time.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this needs to be balanced out
with the size of the overall plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because the plant grows very quickly
and produces flowers, it might be shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: or stunted, might not produce as much
overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that needs to be considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if the plant's too small,
again, those overall years, the total
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass might be reduced, might make it
great for maybe a small tent setup,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe not for large scale production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also if the plant takes a long time to
flower, this can reduce the chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: turning over more growth cycles in a year
if you're growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have that consideration to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have more growth cycles and turn
over faster?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you grow a little bit longer and get
more yield per growth cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there's that balance there and
things to consider when you're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the speed it takes that plant to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get a genetic test, you have a
plant that may be an isolate, this can be
[SPEAKER_00]: used for cloning to allow further
proliferation of those certain genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potentially also getting into the breeding
and crossing of those genetics into other
[SPEAKER_00]: lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's multiple individuals that may
be possible to produce pollen from the
[SPEAKER_00]: female plant, allowing for feminized seed
production method to also be employed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this channel is more information on
that if you want to look at exactly how to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just another consideration to
make when you're considering what plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to go through and clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the genetics, maybe get a profile
test that can be advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we talk about the chemical profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at the chemical profiles,
similar to the genetic profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: but these can also be influenced by
environmental factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be mindful that take this into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you test a plant one time for
terpenes, you might get slightly different
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers if you test it again, if you
change your fertilizer regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if there's a uniquely desirable
chemical profile, such as cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, even if the plant's morphology
is poor, it may be worth cloning to
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporate that into a breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get one genetic set to isolate the
profiles and then breed that into a better
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that's better morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to get to the best of both
worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal be to multiply plants from known
quality chemical profiles and then breed
[SPEAKER_00]: them with other plants in hopes of
altering the morphology while still
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining the chemical profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that breeding process does take
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think you're just going to go
through, breed it once and get the end
[SPEAKER_00]: result.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to take some trial and
error, even on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's age can impact the rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So younger plants typically have improved
rooting over those older plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when given the option, you want to
select the most youthful plant material to
[SPEAKER_00]: age and maximizing the potential success
of your cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean that the older plants cannot
root, but we're looking at having that
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum rooting, that quickest,
best turnaround time, the younger the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, the increased odds that you have of
producing a vigorous root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the end, really what it comes
down to is grower's choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to selecting a plant for
cloning, it comes down to what the grower
[SPEAKER_00]: determines to be desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a delicate and time-consuming
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in short, the grower needs to justify
this investment with hopes of producing a
[SPEAKER_00]: quality end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the person here, we see the flag at
the far end.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just take a left or right to breed
this way or that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be two different ways to get
to end goal, but ultimately it's that
[SPEAKER_00]: grower's decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example of a whole bunch of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this grower, they determined this
one was desirable and chopped all the
[SPEAKER_00]: other ones down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why it's mindful or wise for
growers to go through and have an idea
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're breeding for, have an idea
what they're looking, and to constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: make those selections based on that same
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're as efficient as you can with the
entire process because even being
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient, it will still take time to get
that high-end quality end result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of part of the fun and
interest with the cloning process and the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic isolates when we're talking about
cannabis or other plants in general.
