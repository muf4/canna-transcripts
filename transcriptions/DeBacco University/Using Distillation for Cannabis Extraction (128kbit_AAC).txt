[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this DeBacco University video,
we're going to go over the distillation of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to produce an extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it may look like there's a lot of
equipment here, and there is, and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of little degrees of specialization,
this is a very popular method used for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to go over using this
distillation process for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction and why despite its
complexities it's utilized at such a large
[SPEAKER_00]: scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what's the general
description of the distillation process?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there's going to be some
differences depending exactly the process
[SPEAKER_00]: that you may look at, but they're all
going to have the same basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The distillation method is going to be
using a solvent extraction method and a
[SPEAKER_00]: distillation kit extraction of the desired
plant material until you have all the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids
collected in one mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This material must go through
decarboxylation and also winterization
[SPEAKER_00]: steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see a lot of these kind of
distillation areas, a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: receding flasks, so there's a lot of
necessarily moving parts, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: components that are required as part of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using a precise heating element,
the material is heated to the max of 315
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Fahrenheit to boil off the
terpenes and flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resulting steam is then pushed through
a series of cooling tubes where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: condensed back into just the desired
flavonoid-terpene mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So temperature regulation, temperature
moderation, all very important because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to determine exactly how you
collect everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you continue to raise the temperature
to boil off the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of going through this
distillation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pulling off one thing, next thing,
next thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you continue to raise the temperature
to boil off the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabinoid steam is then cooled via
cooling tubes and condensed into highly
[SPEAKER_00]: potent distilled cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resulting two mixtures are then combined
to create the end product which is
[SPEAKER_00]: typically the THC to distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is a lot of simplified versions
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw before, there's a lot of other
machines, a lot of other separation
[SPEAKER_00]: methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a simplified version here.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, one necessary component is
usually what we see here, we see this
[SPEAKER_00]: right here, is called a rotary evaporator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this rotary evaporator receives the
solvent that was used to extract the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids from the flour and heats off
the solvent, often ethanol-based,
[SPEAKER_00]: and leaves the crude oil waiting for the
decarboxylation step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see here temperature
regulations, we see a lot of computer
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled things which is very good
because we want to have everything
[SPEAKER_00]: repeatable and consistent to get those
exact particular terpenes or cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking for this extraction method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that decarboxylation step,
the crude oil from the rotary evaporator
[SPEAKER_00]: is moved to an alternate container and is
ready for decarboxylation where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: heated to about 104 degrees Celsius for 90
minutes while spinning at 250 revolutions
[SPEAKER_00]: per minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's kind of that crude kind of
general extract that's going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that rotation that is occurring
and spinning and we can see temperature as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as time, very important protocols as
part of this process of extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now an example of a white film
distillation machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see one pictured right in the
image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see these different flasps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see very different colorations
because remember we're extracting,
[SPEAKER_00]: distilling off different components.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the top right, the decarboxylation oil
from the rotary evaporator is ready to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the bottom left flask
where the distillate or terpenes is
[SPEAKER_00]: located.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom right flask here is the crude
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have extracting terpenes at
lower temperatures, about 158 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius in high pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extracting distillate is a higher
temperature, about 170 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the lowest possible pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pass the oil through the extract,
the terpenes, then take the crude oil from
[SPEAKER_00]: that pass and put it back in the machine
for a distillation extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes things do have to pass
through multiple times just to ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: you're pulling off those specific
fractions of that original product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what is that resulting end product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the end product of cannabis
distillation is the, to distillate as we
[SPEAKER_00]: can see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pure oil-like substance with nearly
100% cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This distillate is used as the base
ingredient for most edibles and most
[SPEAKER_00]: vapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be either THC or CBD based or a
multitude of other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this high percentage and this
degree of specificity, it's why this
[SPEAKER_00]: method of extraction for cannabis is so
popular despite all of the required kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of chemist background and distillate
process and equipment and monitoring and
[SPEAKER_00]: protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a kind of advantage in the end
product after going through all those
[SPEAKER_00]: steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what are some advantages of this
distillation method just in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: That, as I said, extremely pure product
when compared to other extraction methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have those distinct separations
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also gives the operator complete control
over terpenes and flavonoids and it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: easily automated even though initially it
may take a little time to kind of learn
[SPEAKER_00]: all the protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can, it has the option to be easily
automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: However with any system it's always not
just advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the disadvantages of this
system is that it can be very costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a long process with multiple
steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take days to pass one liter of
crude oil through the machine and the
[SPEAKER_00]: distillation process strips the cannabis
of all compounds except for the desired
[SPEAKER_00]: compound which may have dramatic effects
on the terpenes when adding them back into
[SPEAKER_00]: the mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just an important thing to keep
in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great that it's very specific but
because it's specific you're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: separating out those components that maybe
have a synergistic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this hopefully explains a little bit
about the distillation method of
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction for cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
