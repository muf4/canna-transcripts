[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
we're going to go over some caterpillar
[SPEAKER_00]: identification and control, as well as at
the end show you two different species of
[SPEAKER_00]: caterpillars feeding on cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into caterpillar
identification and control on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, there's many different
types of caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, all that in some way negatively
impact cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These would be the few covered here,
but realizers are even more than these
[SPEAKER_00]: just in the list provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, painted lady identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're typically two to five leaves
maybe webbed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might kind of see this kind of like a
cocoon like structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of this ragged chewing
injuries will also be evident in that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The caterpillars within the webbed leaf
kind of shelter there are notably spiny
[SPEAKER_00]: and early stage of larvae are tail brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they age, they become variable marked
with black and yellow with considerable
[SPEAKER_00]: range in the overall coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see kind of what the
butterfly looks like, as well as that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of spiny look here to the actual
caterpillar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to identify this as well as
others at all stages of their life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the salt marsh caterpillar
identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is damage to hemp by salt marsh
caterpillar is likely to be minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peak feeding occurs late in the season is
limited mainly to the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see some salt marsh caterpillar
shown, some of the ranging colorations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a little bit more variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just kind of like one standard
look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be aware of that when we're
looking at identifying the caterpillar you
[SPEAKER_00]: might be finding on your cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the yellow woolly bear for
identification and does have a yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does look very woolly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damage by hemp is likely also thought to
be minimal by this caterpillar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peak feeding occurs also late in the
season and is limited to basically the
[SPEAKER_00]: foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that just because you find
a caterpillar on your plant doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doomed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of this feeding occurs late in the
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it might be minimal, but still
worth a proper identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: The zebra caterpillar identification here
and hemp damage limited small amount
[SPEAKER_00]: foliage scattered throughout the planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damage to hemp by the zebra caterpillar
can be expected to be minimal and
[SPEAKER_00]: insignificant to crop yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a distinctive one both in the
caterpillar stage, a little bit less so in
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual adult stage there.
[SPEAKER_00]: More brown, a little even more able to
blend in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of that neat bright yellow stripes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those very distinctive black lines on
white background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the variegated cutworm and
this appears to primarily feed on hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it is known to tunnel into
developing flowers and fruit of other
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure to inspect developing buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is known to be a kind of tunneler.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it happens on other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: And hemp, you know, it's typically found
on the outer portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the ability to tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be mindful of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the managing of the
caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So caterpillars are most effectively
controlled and they're small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most pesticides will have little to no
effect on bigger caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most are based on BT as the active
ingredient, Bacillus thuringiensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemical control should be used as a last
resort.
[SPEAKER_00]: As proper fertility, irrigation,
sanitation should all prior be prioritized
[SPEAKER_00]: over pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also on some of the larger ones
and small applications could be hand
[SPEAKER_00]: removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get into actually seeing some of
these caterpillars sadly in action feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: on cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, we see an army worm eating
a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the audio is not necessarily true to
the actual what's going on, but we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: in real time just how aggressive one of
these caterpillars can basically be.
[SPEAKER_00]: These worms are how quick they can eat and
devour a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see here really close to the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's of course of concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually where there's one,
while none pictured in the image here,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's a few more and it's more
scouting as well as control.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to army worms, we also have
another caterpillar pest here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a winter moth feeding on a
cannabis plant located in a high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
