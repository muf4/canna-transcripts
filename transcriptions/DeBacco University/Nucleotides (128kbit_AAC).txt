[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at
nucleotides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those playing the home game,
we will recognize these as the monomeric
[SPEAKER_00]: unit or the building block for our nucleic
acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see them listed right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to define our pyrimidines and
our purines, our uracils, diamine,
[SPEAKER_00]: cytosine, and adenine and guanine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will make up our nucleotides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking specifically, our nucleic
acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: A nucleotide is composed of three parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is a nitrogenous base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a nitrogen base containing a
carbon-nitrogen ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the nitrogen is located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon would be located here, here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here this indicates a double bond
between these two carbons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the components of our nucleic
acids is our nitrogen-containing base that
[SPEAKER_00]: is linked to a five-carbon sugar,
which is called a pentose sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is ribose in RNA, which stands
for ribonucleic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this sugar would be a deoxyribose in
DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see a comparison between those
two in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have a phosphate group here,
a PO4 molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice the oxygens have negative
charges to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what gives nucleic acids their
negative charge on their backbone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because here we have the oxygens creating
that negative charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of that base C located here
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's causing it to have a
negative charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we do electrophoresis,
they'll be pulled towards a positive
[SPEAKER_00]: charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said here, can we spot the
difference between deoxyribose and ribose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking specifically at that pentose sugar
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you look at it a little bit,
then you know deoxy means without oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is missing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that indicated right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our ribose has an oxygen, and the deoxy
means without oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore, that does not have oxygen
bound to its sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking over here, we have our purines
located up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purines are a double ring nitrogen
base.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are classified as adenine and guanine
have these double ring structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on this side, over here, there are
pyrimidines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are a single ring nitrogen base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cytosine, which would be present in
both DNA and RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diamine will only be present in DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And uracil will only be present in DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at our nucleotides,
that can help us identify what particular
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleic acid we are looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly here, a pairing of nucleotides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nucleotides bond between DNA strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're what we call complementary
strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always a purine linked with a
pyrimidine by way of hydrogen bonds,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A binds with T.
[SPEAKER_00]: T binds with A.
[SPEAKER_00]: G binds with C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And C binds with J.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are complementary, not identical
strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look down one side of the DNA,
adenine, A binds with T, there's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a complementary thiamine on the other
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we see a guanine, there will be a
complementary cytosine on the other side
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're looking at particular DNA,
because we see thiamine here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that helps describe some
monomeric units for nucleic acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
