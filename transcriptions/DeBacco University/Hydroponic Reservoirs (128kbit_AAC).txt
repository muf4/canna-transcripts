[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to talk about
hydroponic reservoirs, which are basically
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoirs or holding containers for
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: See one here on a very large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically we have these on a much smaller
scale for smaller hydroponic operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general should be as large as
possible for the given space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have something overly
oversized and something undersized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to match the area or space that
you'll be growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we locate an area that does not
cause them to overheat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep evaporation to a minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep the heat down as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The level, the EC, and the temperature
need to be monitored.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say level, I mean the height within
the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to let it get too low,
because if you're running pumps
[SPEAKER_00]: especially, that could cause pumps to burn
out or it could cause not enough water to
[SPEAKER_00]: reach your plants and cause them to have
water stress and could ultimately cause
[SPEAKER_00]: them to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: The target temperature would be 60 and 75
degrees Fahrenheit, 18 to 24 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep temps below 85 degrees
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: or 30 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything higher than this should be
avoided due to the increased odds of root
[SPEAKER_00]: damage because water holds oxygen at a
much poorer level at these warmer
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a heater is added, be sure to circulate
the water to allow even temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be needed if your temperature
is falling below 60 degrees Fahrenheit for
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever reason, below 18 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a water heater is advantageous
to add depending on your location of your
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir, but keep in mind that you do
want to stir that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, it will just be a small area of
really warm water and it will cause
[SPEAKER_00]: stratification in the aquatic environment
that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Covers are advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be covers to limit light and
reduce the chance of algae growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I have some sort of lid on them,
it could be simply a piece of plastic here
[SPEAKER_00]: that eliminates light penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also help control water loss and
prevent underwater items from falling into
[SPEAKER_00]: the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here there's a cover, but there's
also a more solid grate cover here to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent anything from falling into this
reservoir tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, having the lids that seals
airtight may initially sound like a good
[SPEAKER_00]: idea, but actually this can cause suction
and reduce the flow of water to the
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you may want to put a lid on that,
you want to make sure that there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: form of air exchange that is occurring,
especially if you're using pumps to pump
[SPEAKER_00]: water out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make those pumps work any
harder and increase the chance of failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having some sort of breathability is a
good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to necessarily have it
sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply having it mostly covered and sealed
from the outside, from outside light,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a good idea, but keeping it sealed so
that it's airtight is not advised because
[SPEAKER_00]: you can reduce your evaporation loss
vastly by just having this cover over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to keep it airtight.
Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
