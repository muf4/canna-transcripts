[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so here we're going to go over some of
the periodic table trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're familiar with the general
organization of the periodic table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will allow you to develop a
greater understanding of exactly why it's
[SPEAKER_00]: organized the way that it is and what
inferences we can make about certain
[SPEAKER_00]: elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with ionic trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elements on the left, which are metals,
tend to lose valence electrons to form
[SPEAKER_00]: positive ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, valence electrons are the
outermost electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this image here, the gray circle
represents the neutral form of the atom,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the red represents the ion form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're losing those valence
electrons, the radius is getting smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice that the atom becomes smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast here, elements on the right
side, the nonmetals, tend to gain
[SPEAKER_00]: electrons to become negative ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here's our neutral atom in the
gray, and when we're adding that negative
[SPEAKER_00]: electron, we could see that the radius is
actually becoming larger in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because here we're losing that outer
shell, those outer electrons, becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're kind of gaining more,
and that's causing our radius to become
[SPEAKER_00]: larger in those ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cations, positive ions, tend to form
smaller radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anions, or negative ions, tend to form a
larger radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about ions here,
and we're looking at binding them at
[SPEAKER_00]: current and it's occurring, or we're
looking at bonding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, two of the same type,
so two negatives, or two positives,
[SPEAKER_00]: will repel each other, and a positive and
a negative will attract one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A positive and a positive are repulsive,
and a positive and a negative are
[SPEAKER_00]: attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be important to get to
molecules and how things bind together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our periodic trends, properties of
elements, tend to occur in a periodic way,
[SPEAKER_00]: known as a trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you move across a period or down a
group is what we're going to be looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing element trends allows us to make
predictions about an element's behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting first with atomic radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the measure of the size of an atom.
[SPEAKER_00]: For elements that occur as molecules,
the atomic radius is half the distance
[SPEAKER_00]: between nuclei of identical atoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average distance from the center of
the nucleus to the edge of the adjacent
[SPEAKER_00]: electron cloud is determined to be the
radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's our trend look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, atomic radius increases as you move
down a group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just look at group one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we move down our group or our family,
we see the radius is increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why does this occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually occurs to a lesser extent to
all of them here, we notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This increase that we see in our radius is
because of the increased number of
[SPEAKER_00]: electron energy levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more energy levels, the larger the
radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we compare our row two here,
or our period two, as we go down to period
[SPEAKER_00]: four, we notice these radius all gets
larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting that in a different kind of way to
visually see that, you can see these are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to give you a 3D effect with the
height of columns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see here, these columns are
smaller, indicating the radius is smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are taller, indicating a larger
radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have an increasing going from right
to left and increasing in radius going
[SPEAKER_00]: from top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what tends to throw students here is
the atomic radius generally decreases as
[SPEAKER_00]: you move from left to right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at period four, for example,
all the way on the left here, we see a
[SPEAKER_00]: large radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we continue down that period to get to
here, we see a smaller radius occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: down this end.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is due to the increase in negative
charges providing a greater pull by the
[SPEAKER_00]: positive nucleus reducing the radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here we have one electron on the
outside, one negative charge way on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, which is allowing the radius to
decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: The radius has to be quite large.
[SPEAKER_00]: That positive charge of the nucleus can't
really pull much in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a lot of electrons on the
outside creating a greater negative
[SPEAKER_00]: charge, giving those positive protons and
nucleus something greater to pull on,
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling them closer, reducing the overall
atomic radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ionization energy is basically the minimum
amount of energy required to remove a
[SPEAKER_00]: valence electron forming a cation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cations are positive ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ionization energy increases up a family
and from left to right down a period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helium, HE, requires the greatest amount
of energy to remove a valence electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here, the greatest amount of
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, all our noble gases, helium,
neon, argon, require a lot more energy to
[SPEAKER_00]: remove that electron than say our alkali
metals, which are our lithium,
[SPEAKER_00]: our sodium, our potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're looking at trends here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electron affinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electron affinity is the amount of energy
released when an electron is added to a
[SPEAKER_00]: neutral atom or molecule to form an anion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anions are negative ions and it occurs
when we add an electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: This follows a similar trend to ionization
energy across the periodic table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if we learn one, we can see
electron affinity has some of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: properties to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metallic character refers to the level of
reactivity of a metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It increases as you go down a family.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most reactive metals are found in the
lower left portion of the periodic table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a periodic table,
take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to find cesium, which is going to
be in that lower left-hand portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not found in nature as a free element
since it reacts explosively with water and
[SPEAKER_00]: will ignite spontaneously in air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Francium, as far as the same why,
it's below the cesium in the alkali metal
[SPEAKER_00]: group, but it is also very rare that most
of its properties have never been
[SPEAKER_00]: observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are very reactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have a lot of that metallic
character.
[SPEAKER_00]: A non-metallic character relates to the
tendency to accept electrons during
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of the opposite of what we just
discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-metals tend to gain electrons in
chemical reactions and have a high
[SPEAKER_00]: attraction for electrons within a
compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most reactive non-metals reside in the
upper right-hand portion of the periodic
[SPEAKER_00]: table, fluorine being the most reactive
since noble gases are basically
[SPEAKER_00]: unreactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Noble gases are unreactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to look at fluorine being the most
reactive with the non-metallic character.
[SPEAKER_00]: A small sample of pale yellow liquid
fluorine is condensed at liquid nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that here, keeping it very
cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to be confused with the major fluorine
containing mineral fluorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, fluorine, fluorite might sound
familiar, very distinctly in very
[SPEAKER_00]: different properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly here, metallic and non-metallic
character is more of a general trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no clear distinction or distinct
division between metallic and non-metallic
[SPEAKER_00]: character.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you move across the periodic table,
there's an increasing tendency to accept
[SPEAKER_00]: electrons, which is a non-metallic
property, and decrease the possibility of
[SPEAKER_00]: an atom that would give up one or more
electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the picture here going from black to
white.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see this large gray area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just showing that there's not a clear
division.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of this general trend that
occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just to go back to the first
slide here of our general trends,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see how electron affinity changes,
ionization energy, atomic radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we'll increase it to go top to
bottom, and right to left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electron affinity follows ionization
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that metallic and non-metallic
character is kind of that kind of gray
[SPEAKER_00]: area, that black to white kind of
transition that does occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have to review this just a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus especially on atomic radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll learn some of the key terms here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help us develop trends to better
understand elements of the periodic table
[SPEAKER_00]: that we may not be able to specifically
study.
