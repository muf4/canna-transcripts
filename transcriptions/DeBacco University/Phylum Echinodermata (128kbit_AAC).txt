[SPEAKER_00]: This video is on the animal phylum
Echidromidae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as you can tell by the duration of
this video, it's not very long,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that was worth mentioning and at least
devoting a couple slides to in a little
[SPEAKER_00]: time too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what does this exactly mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It refers to spiny skin of the
endoskeleton of the calcium-rich osticles
[SPEAKER_00]: just beneath the Echidromidae skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are entirely marine animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They live entirely in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: They include sea stars, sea urchins,
sand dollars, and sea cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's an interesting fact about these is
that they're bilaterally symmetrical as
[SPEAKER_00]: larvae, but become radial symmetry as
adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radial symmetry is referring to that
anywhere through the midpoint that you
[SPEAKER_00]: draw a plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're symmetrical, but they're
bilaterally symmetrical as larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a general overview here of the
anatomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, nothing that I'm going to focus on
particularly in class, but again if we do
[SPEAKER_00]: a dissection or really just to appreciate
some of the anatomy of these animals,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've included a picture here at the end.
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
