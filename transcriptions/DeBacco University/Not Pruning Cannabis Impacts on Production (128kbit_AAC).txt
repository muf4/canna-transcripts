[SPEAKER_00]: So this channel focuses a lot on different
pruning methods and you can research a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of options, but never wonder what happens
if you really chose not to prune your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This video here at Tobacco University will
help give you some information on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into not pruning
cannabis plants and see what impact that
[SPEAKER_00]: has on production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, you have that untouched
growth habit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see an image right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unpruned or untrained cannabis plants grow
like a Christmas tree basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of that nice triangular shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time of flowering, this will
typically mean the plants will have a
[SPEAKER_00]: dense leaf canopy with minimal light
penetration into the plant, into the inner
[SPEAKER_00]: portions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This result in smaller and typically
weaker branches and buds lower and deeper
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plant canopy because they're simply
not getting a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: These small buds would be called popcorn
due to their small and minimal density
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gets into the great debate of are
you looking for quantity or are you
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it is possible for buds to
develop with less light, it can come down
[SPEAKER_00]: to quantity versus quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a simple X amount of light
equals X amount of ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partially shaded buds can still produce
quality buds, just may not be the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this style of growing will
increase the amount of popcorn buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are smaller sized and typically have
lower density as we see in this image,
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to what's determined to be a
higher quality bud located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we're not going to be pruning,
that's one option for growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even if you don't plan on that pruning
method, growers should still be going
[SPEAKER_00]: through removing yellow leaves to reduce
the chance of disease or insect and have
[SPEAKER_00]: them kind of placed to initially become
established.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're trying to do is remove some
leaves, even if we're not pruning,
[SPEAKER_00]: simply because some of the leaves could
create a starting point for disease to
[SPEAKER_00]: start or insects to start, which would
affect not only the entire plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but any neighboring plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you're not going to go through
and prune, selective defoliation is still
[SPEAKER_00]: advised and it helps you kind of inspect
the plants individually, catch any
[SPEAKER_00]: problems that might arise very early on so
you can implement corrective measures that
[SPEAKER_00]: will have the maximum chance of
effectiveness.
