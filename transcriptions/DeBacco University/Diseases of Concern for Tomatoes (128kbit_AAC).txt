[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at some
diseases of concern for tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of the major ones to be on
the lookout for here, right with a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures, and if you can't identify these
pictures, you'll see them later in the
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, starting with our diseases,
we want to look at initially how to
[SPEAKER_00]: control them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's the organic standards,
and then there's the chemical options.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the organic standards, typically the
use of copper should be limited,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it is armory certified,
because it doesn't contain carbon and can
[SPEAKER_00]: persist in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a good option to have on hand,
in addition to oxidate, regalia,
[SPEAKER_00]: and grandivo.
[SPEAKER_00]: For chemical options, it's not necessarily
the worst of all the options, if it's used
[SPEAKER_00]: with a careful IPM program, integrated
pest management practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Staple chemical products would be
something like Abravo, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorothionyl, manzate, and copper in the
form of COSY 3000, which is not armory
[SPEAKER_00]: certified, but has shown some
effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at the specific diseases,
well, one is powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what to look for is white fluffy spots
on the leaves, and when you're inspecting
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants, you want to look for shaded
areas under leaves where there's not a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of sunlight penetration, and also high
humidity and moisture content.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, spacing your plants out to reduce
the leaf wetness, and pruning can also
[SPEAKER_00]: help with this throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to control organically 40% milk and
60% water can be effective, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: oxidate, which doesn't last very long,
is an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemically, Valley 40 worked pretty good
last year in Abravo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Altenaria, or early blight, will look like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's small black specks located on the
lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lesions can have rings like a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of see here, we have these
distinctive kind of rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a key part for identifying that you
have early blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, limit soil splash onto the leaves
and ensure good light penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxidate or copper for organic,
bravo, manzate, or copper for organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copper for chemical control options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Late blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one gets a lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of growers that think they
have late blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pay attention to the specific images
and some of the key concepts here for late
[SPEAKER_00]: blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lesions usually start on both the leaves,
but can progress to fruit and stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically, people will see them on the
leaves first, but it can progress to the
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit and also the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, it occurs as large spots and
not small pinpoints.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here, a large portion of the leaf is
infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common during heat waves and later in the
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to really prevent this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, resistant varieties is a good first
step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, those seeds will cost more,
but it's worth it if late blight does come
[SPEAKER_00]: in later in the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organically, copper and oxidate can be
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxidate's not great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copper's pretty much the only option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemically, if you can use mankazeb,
that has been shown effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some key images or classic symptoms,
I should say, for late blight would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire leaf you see here looks perfectly
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just one large lesion here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see on some other leaves and it's
also on the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also looking here at the tomato,
this is a large area here that's infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I provided a link down at the bottom if
you want to look at and gain some more
[SPEAKER_00]: information about late blight in
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacterial specks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are very small dark specks that
are circular.
[SPEAKER_00]: See these small little dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be seen both on the leaves and
also on the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to avoid soil splash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because this is a bacteria,
fungicides don't work very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So applying a copper would be advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it can be consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a farm that I visited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how it's very consistent in
the lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you zoom in, you see these small
little specks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be bacterial speck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Verticillium mulch, another one that
affects the lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like they're kind of burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very similar to like a fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part here is to rotate crops and
plant resistant varieties because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: really not much you can do for
verticillium once you get it in season
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is a systemic disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly here is leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fuzzy kind of top and bottom to the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But especially look at the underside or
the lower leaf surface because you'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: these kind of lesions that appear here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just looking from the top,
you'll see kind of what looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: yellowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip that leaf over and you'll see actual
leaf mold there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very common in high tunnels,
in fields where there's a lot of moisture,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of hanging fog early in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to inspect transplants before
they go out into the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they are started in the greenhouse
or high tunnel, maybe make an application
[SPEAKER_00]: there if you see it before they go out
into the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have good air circulation and avoid
feeding plants with a lot of nitrogen can
[SPEAKER_00]: help reduce this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxidate and BRAVA would be two methods
that you could apply to help control this
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
Thank you.
