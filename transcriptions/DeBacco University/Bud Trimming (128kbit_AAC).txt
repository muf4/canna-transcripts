[SPEAKER_00]: An important part with the production of
cannabis and the end of flowers here is
[SPEAKER_00]: bud trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking the raw plant product, trimming it
down to produce just the fine nug or bud
[SPEAKER_00]: here at the very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, it can be a very
labor-intensive process and take a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is for the manual version.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how many people get an
entry-level position in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're bud trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: For them, shear selection is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some qualities you should look
for, such as the size, the blades that are
[SPEAKER_00]: used, and the weight of the actual
scissors that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality equipment should have nonstick
blades, should have an ergonomic handle,
[SPEAKER_00]: and be lightweight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because typically, as I said, very
labor-intensive and takes a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But apart, it comes down to personal
preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may prefer the straight
blades, as I have shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some may prefer angled blades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that comes down to personal
preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nonstick blades, lightweight,
and something that's comfortable in your
[SPEAKER_00]: hand, are all things you should be looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also automated systems,
a trommel system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very common large operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may hear the name Twister.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a name brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one that makes very large-scale
trommel-style pruners and cutters that
[SPEAKER_00]: basically take raw plant material and cut
it down here to the initial formal buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, just because this is automated
doesn't mean that there isn't a need for
[SPEAKER_00]: QC or quality control.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, automated systems can get
expensive and require a specific set of
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters, such as the angle and the feed
rate and running of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes sometimes a little while to get
dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: To work properly, there is a need for a
continual flow of buds, so high value
[SPEAKER_00]: material is required with these automated
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may still need human eyes and hands to
provide some quality control and do some
[SPEAKER_00]: last trimming of things that got missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, it's the removal of crow's
feet, which are the small leaves at the
[SPEAKER_00]: base of the bud that the trommel may miss
in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to have the extra set of
eyes to go through so you can ensure at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end you're sending out a quality and
consistent product.
