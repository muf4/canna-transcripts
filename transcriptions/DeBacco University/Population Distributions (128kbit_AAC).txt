[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're looking at population
distributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at this image and the apples
in it, you can see how they're
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, it's kind of a random
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if we zoom out from this one
particular image and look at the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: field, we'd see odds are these apples
would be concentrated in one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at population distributions
in a little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, we're going to look at a normal
population distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can look here, we see as we increase
n, or the number of individuals,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see a more defined what we call a bell
curve here, with the odds are,
[SPEAKER_00]: or normal, average being right here in the
center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, n of four, we see it increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a little bit more of a defined
characteristics at 16 to 32 to 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're really getting a sense of this
normal distribution curve, often referred
[SPEAKER_00]: to as the bell curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this means is the average will be
here in the middle, and 34.1% will be one
[SPEAKER_00]: standard deviation to the right,
and 34.1% to the right, to the left,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we get further away, we see a smaller
percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a very small percentage that would
be way out here, same thing here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: other scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you think about this would be height.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to measure height of a bunch
of individuals of the same age,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd have a couple really tall people,
a couple really short people, and the vast
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of people being in that normal
distribution or close to that average
[SPEAKER_00]: height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now fish populations distribute over
temperature range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're looking at population
distributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how water temperature influences
fishing for small pelagic species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bluefin tuna and mahi mahi, or dolphin,
are pelagic species.
[SPEAKER_00]: In normal conditions, you can see most of
the fish here are about 50 meters down
[SPEAKER_00]: from the surface, but during an El Nino,
where we have that increased water
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, these pelagic species enjoy a
certain water temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, they'll be found much deeper
in the water column.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, if we're a fisherman here
using a net to catch the fish,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could see during normal conditions,
no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, but during El Nino, because those
fish go deeper, seeking that similar water
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, the net is ineffective in
this example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now specific population distributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have something here called random
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It occurs when there's no competition,
antagonism, or tendency to aggregate,
[SPEAKER_00]: which tends to be rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this random distribution, if you look
at the hillside here, the presence of
[SPEAKER_00]: conifer trees is random, the presence of
maple trees is random, oak trees is
[SPEAKER_00]: random, and it kind of looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like you took a bunch of
marbles and just kind of threw them out
[SPEAKER_00]: over an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a random distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have uniform distribution,
which results from intense competition or
[SPEAKER_00]: antagonism between individuals and tends
to be rarely found.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here with the penguins,
pretty much all evenly, the distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: is very evenly spaced, kind of like
students in a class.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see they're all kind of like
facing here, like we're viewing from the
[SPEAKER_00]: teacher standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we don't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We typically see in classes kids talking
or on their phones, and we see kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the penguins here nicely facing
the camera here, paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another population distribution would be
what we call clumping.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the most common distribution
because environmental conditions are
[SPEAKER_00]: seldom uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reproductive patterns favor clumping,
and anal behavior patterns often lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: congregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here, there's kind of like
little clumps of these particular
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The optimum density for population growth
and survival is often an intermediate one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Undercrowning can be as harmful as
overcrowding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to take this into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We often think of the negatives being too
many organisms in one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: In certain cases, under-crowning can also
be harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just too few individuals in an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at population dispersal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the spread of the
Africanized honeybees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see them evident here in Texas,
and then spreading outwardly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, how can you explain
their success in expanding their
[SPEAKER_00]: territory, these Africanized honeybees?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking specifically at our
population dispersal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are they originally brought to Brazil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, researchers brought the Africanized
honeybees to Brazil in the 1950s in an
[SPEAKER_00]: attempt to improve productivity of the
Brazilian bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these Africanized honeybees were
brought to Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see they've expanded well beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were originally brought with good
intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, how can you explain the success
of expanding their territories?
[SPEAKER_00]: We see them starting to move into Mexico
and then Texas and the southern regions of
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Africanized honeybees produce more
offspring They defend their nest much more
[SPEAKER_00]: fiercely in greater numbers and are more
likely to abandon their nest when
[SPEAKER_00]: threatened by predators or adverse
environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just a couple of the ways to
explain how these Africanized honeybees
[SPEAKER_00]: have been able to vastly increase their
population dispersal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Population growth rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The increase in population during a period
of time expresses a percentage of the
[SPEAKER_00]: population at the start of that period.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reflects the number of births and
deaths during a period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we could see here the average
population growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice here Germany and Japan,
they are below zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually have negative population
growth rates, which means that they are,
[SPEAKER_00]: every year that goes by, their population
is decreasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's possible for population growth to
be negative here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something we want to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to look at the average and if
things are well above or below that
[SPEAKER_00]: average, how that makes influence the
world's population and how it may
[SPEAKER_00]: influence the resources that we use on a
global scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
