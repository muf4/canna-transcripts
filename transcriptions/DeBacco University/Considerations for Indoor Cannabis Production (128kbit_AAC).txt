[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to grow your cannabis indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what are some considerations for
indoor production of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go over some of the details
here and if you are considering it,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully give you some ideas to think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing cannabis indoors
already, some review of some of the key
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects you should be having under
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the
considerations for indoor cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off with our indoor environment,
the goal should be quality and not
[SPEAKER_00]: quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If quantity is your goal, you want to
consider an outdoor operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have a separate video on that here in
Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have control over conditions in
the indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal is to maximize production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that there are different plant
environmental target ranges as the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: grows to maximize the end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grower should make sure that they're
adjusting to those changes to match the
[SPEAKER_00]: stage of the plant development.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to keep the temperature
always the same, the humidity always the
[SPEAKER_00]: same from the seedling stage or the clone
stage all the way to the harvest stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to maximize that target range as
that plant grows and develops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those are going to start to shift
and change.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, humidity very early on might
need higher humidity and you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be decreasing that as the plant grows and
develops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're talking about this plant growing
for an indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to have greater upfront cost,
so you want to know what your budget is
[SPEAKER_00]: and you want to know that from a very
early on so you can scale your operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both the initial investment and also the
ongoing cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider the electricity to run the lights
just because you spend all your budget on
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're going to have to also supply
that with electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also have to supply money to cool that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at carbon dioxide enrichment,
buying the bottles, yes, buying the setup,
[SPEAKER_00]: great, but then also supplementing with
more carbon dioxide as the growing season
[SPEAKER_00]: goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a simplified indoor grower growing
kind of checklist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure of your size,
your growing area appropriately,
[SPEAKER_00]: have proper monitoring systems,
growing substrate containers, air
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation and ventilation such as HVAC
systems, lighting, carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: enrichment and irrigation are just a few
things you want to be making sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: consider and have a plan for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to go into those just
briefly here and there are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: more videos on this in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off the growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about indoor operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking a grow tent and grow tents
can be very small to quite large.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking just a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we can see a much larger area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's going to be the size of your
growing operation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what type of monitoring systems are
you going to be using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Using a digital system as you see here or
an analog system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, both have their merits and pros and
cons and there'll be more videos on
[SPEAKER_00]: Tobacco University here to explore some of
the details and kind of weigh some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: advantages and disadvantages of each of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for a growing substrate, are you going
to grow in soilless mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to choose to grow in rock
wall?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a cocoa car, maybe sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different growing substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, which one are you going to choose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one's the best fit for your
operation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Containers, you might just think,
oh, we're going to put the plant in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what are you going to put the plant
in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be a plastic container?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be a solid wall plastic
container?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be an air pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be a grow bag, a fiber,
kind of a fabric material?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be a biodegradable one?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to be the size of the
container?
[SPEAKER_00]: All these are important considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that air circulation and ventilation,
what about the horizontal airflow?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here multiple fans going.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the vertical airflow?
[SPEAKER_00]: The cooling of the lights, how are you
going to mount the different fans and how
[SPEAKER_00]: are you going to make sure you're
maintaining a proper temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of HVAC system are you going to
have?
[SPEAKER_00]: All important considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The artificial lighting as you're growing
indoors, you don't have the advantage of
[SPEAKER_00]: the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to use LED lighting?
[SPEAKER_00]: High pressure sodium lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here LED, high pressure
sodium, ceramic metal halide, T5
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to be your chosen artificial
light to use?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are you going to necessarily use the
same one for the full growth cycle of your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to transition them from one
to another and why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon dioxide enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at kind of enriching
an area or elevating our carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: levels, what level are we going to choose
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we going to place our sensor?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to deliver that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be some sources of carbon
dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be a heat source?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be a compressed bottle?
[SPEAKER_00]: What controllers and regulators are we
going to utilize?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to be able to use something
called fuzzy logic if we're using a bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: system that would be advised?
[SPEAKER_00]: Different ways or things to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, kind of on our just quick
general checklist provided here,
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to be supplying water to our
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be hydroponically,
it's going to be hand-watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a certain type of water
purification.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to be doing to help
ensure that our plants not only are
[SPEAKER_00]: receiving water, but are receiving quality
water and at a regular basis so that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't restrict their production?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you're thinking about indoor
growing or are looking at indoor growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: this provides that quick general overview,
but there'll be more videos here on
[SPEAKER_00]: Tobacco University for you to check out
and learn some more of the details of each
[SPEAKER_00]: of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best of luck.
