[SPEAKER_00]: In this video on debauchery and diversity,
you will learn how to use bone analysis to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine age, how we can use simply
looking at the bone to determine the age
[SPEAKER_00]: of the individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, in the matrix, bone cells
are surrounded by a matrix which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: non-living hardened material which they
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: This matrix is composed mainly of calcium
and phosphorus compounds along with
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins that make bone hard and slightly
flexible while still maintaining a very
[SPEAKER_00]: strong structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it is supporting the entire body
in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be hard, but it does have a
slight degree of flexibility to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always think of it containing calcium,
which it does, but also contains high
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of phosphorus for the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kelliculi are microscopic canals
between the lucne and the ossified bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at a microscopic
view of the bone here, we can start to see
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this kind of cementing line
evident here, the osteons, the kelliculi
[SPEAKER_00]: are kind of those little canals we see
here, and then the lucne are located right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can be important when we're
looking through a microscope to use these
[SPEAKER_00]: to identify the age of that individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at these bone cells,
keep in mind that we do have bone that's
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly being reformed and bone that's
constantly being broken down no matter
[SPEAKER_00]: your age.
[SPEAKER_00]: The age of the individual will influence
the rate that this occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the osteostite, which remains bone
tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the osteoblast, which forms the
actual matrix that I talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The osteogenic cell, which is the stem
cell, kind of that early on cell that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going through and forming many of the
rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the osteoclast, which is reabsorbing
bone material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these are kind of occurring
ideally in a nice balance for the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: The histology, you're looking kind of at
the microscopic view of compact bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to kind of give you that this is
looking at 10X of ground bone here,
[SPEAKER_00]: what it can look like, and kind of what
we're focusing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The herbarium canal is what we're going to
be looking at here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see looking at this bone here
gets a little confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But looking at herbarium system here,
we can really focus in on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the area within a field of
view that we're going to be looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to determine that approximate age of
the individual, looking at the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: osteons present in bone sample,
taking measures of the herbarium's canals,
[SPEAKER_00]: diameters, can also be useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use this information to calculate the
estimated age of the bone sample,
[SPEAKER_00]: ideally at the time of death here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be used on a skeleton that we
may not know, the height of the individual
[SPEAKER_00]: may know very little about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is looking at that very small,
we don't need a very small portion of that
[SPEAKER_00]: bone, a bone fragment to be able to
determine the age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the image right below me here,
looking at an X-ray of the hand of a 16.27
[SPEAKER_00]: year old male with an automatic
calculation of bone age with the bone
[SPEAKER_00]: expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of puts some measurements there,
puts some kind of calculations and puts it
[SPEAKER_00]: into an algorithm and generates an
estimated age based on a simple X-ray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these osteons that I had mentioned,
they're thin and long cylindrical
[SPEAKER_00]: structures that contain mineral matrix and
living osteocytes connected to the
[SPEAKER_00]: calciculi, which transports blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are solid portions of the bone that
run its length and are easily viewed with
[SPEAKER_00]: a microscope, which is why they tend to be
used as part of this calculation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see them kind of represented in
the cartoon image here, but on the other
[SPEAKER_00]: images you can see them quite clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at that microscope,
what are we looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be counting the osteons.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I use the bone specimen, so it's
completely fills a medium power or 100 X
[SPEAKER_00]: field of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Count the total number of osteons present
in the entire medium power field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind the medium power
objective lens here, would be 10 because
[SPEAKER_00]: we also have to take into account the
microscope we're using, not just the
[SPEAKER_00]: objective lens here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we go about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep in mind what the objective,
but we also want to take into account the
[SPEAKER_00]: eyepiece as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically you're looking at the eyepiece
adding about 10 X to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case where I want medium power
looking at 100 X, while the objective is
[SPEAKER_00]: 10, because the eyepiece adds another
factor of 10, that would be how we would
[SPEAKER_00]: get to 100 X.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we use high power 400 X, that would be
the 40 times 10, would give you 400.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can determine the number of osteons
present by using the variance canals
[SPEAKER_00]: present.
[SPEAKER_00]: If only half of a canal is visible,
then you count it as a 0.5 or half an
[SPEAKER_00]: osteon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to move the sample to 10 new
locations and repeat the process to get
[SPEAKER_00]: your data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then calculate the average number of
osteons viewed under the high power to the
[SPEAKER_00]: 100th place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is again, another way you can go
through and do this is multiple and go and
[SPEAKER_00]: do 10 samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, you want to multiply the average
by 16 to generate the total number of
[SPEAKER_00]: osteons counted under medium power,
which is needed for the age calculation
[SPEAKER_00]: formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use the high power,
just take more samples and multiply it by
[SPEAKER_00]: a factor of 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to use this information?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does it look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the center of each osteon is a
hollow tube called that herbarium canal
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains small blood vessels.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what you're looking at,
that kind of center region there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where ideally the blood vessels
would be present in the individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the diameter of that canal region,
easiest way to calculate the diameter is
[SPEAKER_00]: to use the pointer found in the
microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of pointer there and depends
on the microscope you're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that pointer sometimes will even have
a measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also place a fine scale ruler
under the microscope to calibrate the
[SPEAKER_00]: length of that pointer for the microscope
that you're particularly using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note the magnification will alter the
scale, so make sure your calibration and
[SPEAKER_00]: magnification are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend using typically 400 X,
which is high power is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recommended measure seven random canals
and not the entire osteon under high power
[SPEAKER_00]: using micrometers and note that 0.1
centimeters is one millimeter and that
[SPEAKER_00]: equals a thousand micrometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you want to calculate the average
variance canal diameter here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of gives you an idea of that
increased magnification, how that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to alter your scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of when we get to the end here,
how do we kind of apply that formula for
[SPEAKER_00]: age calculation procedure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we take 30, we add it to the total
number of osteon count in the entire 100 X
[SPEAKER_00]: field of view times 0.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we subtract it by the 0.3 times the
average of varying canal diameter in
[SPEAKER_00]: micrometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take those numbers and that will give
us the approximate age of the individual
[SPEAKER_00]: by plus or minus three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go back and kind of look at the
information presented here, get a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of bone slides, look under the microscope,
get the calibration used to the microscope
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could kind of go through and do
this activity to be able to determine the
[SPEAKER_00]: age of the individual bone that you're
looking at plus or minus three years,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very good for getting a general
classification of that age of the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual can definitely help the
investigation process.
