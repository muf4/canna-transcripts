[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
we're going to go over how does hoplate
[SPEAKER_00]: and viroids spread, which is important for
any grower to understand when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at prevention and a way to combat
a potential issue in your growing
[SPEAKER_00]: operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of concern over hoplate
and viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here we're going to learn about how
does it go about spreading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, a great presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to take some screenshots from
this by Dr. Zemir Opunja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to check out his presentation here
at CanMed23, as well as other information
[SPEAKER_00]: provided in the description link.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does hoplate and viroids spread?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, mechanical damage such as trimming,
the sap contact is actually what is
[SPEAKER_00]: causing that viroid to be transmitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that results in the grower being the
most common vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insect vectors are possible, but at this
time they're not really well understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you a grower trimming from one plant
and move to another plant, you've kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: just inoculated or infected the next
plant, sadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, in addition to trimming the above
portions of the plant, root contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could be root contact physically
with the roots or water curing that from
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots of one plant to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the viroid load is actually
very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And early on, as I'll talk about in a
moment, seeds is another potential way or
[SPEAKER_00]: method of transmission of this hoplate and
viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potential roots of transmission,
as I said about the water, can go through
[SPEAKER_00]: the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flood and drain systems, DWCs,
deep water cultures, clone trays,
[SPEAKER_00]: flood and drain, really any operation that
recirculates water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is of concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also reside in the irrigation
tubes, the growing substrate, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: All areas of potential of transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why or how it can spread so
quickly through an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a very stable viroid and it can
survive in water for up to seven days,
[SPEAKER_00]: so about a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can help speed its infection of
many plants in a growing operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is phloem transmitted, so not to
get too much into the biology aspect,
[SPEAKER_00]: but entering into the phloem is what
allows it to move up as well as down the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, xylem is mainly roots to
shoots or bottom to top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phloem can go basically any direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phloem follows the sugars and it does
translocate through the entire plant or
[SPEAKER_00]: this hoplate and viroid via this root in
about six weeks' time, so very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: An experiment provided here, some of the
data, they made a stem cut and they did an
[SPEAKER_00]: artificial transmission of hoplate and
viroid to exposed stem cuts, as we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The viroid was inoculated at the wound
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: In two weeks post-inoculation,
it could be detected already in the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant as well as the upper stem
portions of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four to six weeks post-infection,
the entire plant becomes infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of this unique jumping
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't just start in one spot and just
radiate out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually goes to specific portions of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've outlined that here, where it was
found in points of inoculation,
[SPEAKER_00]: found the roots in two weeks, in youngs in
four weeks, and then the rest of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: in six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was interesting about this path of
infection is, you know, stem top
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculated, the roots were actually the
first point where it reached detectable
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then other top growing tips, and then the
lower leaves or branches became positive
[SPEAKER_00]: for hoplate and viroid in that order,
in that two to six week time frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important we're looking at
potentially taking samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots may be a good area to sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of shows another visual.
[SPEAKER_00]: The viroid travels down first to the
roots, indicating that it is phloem
[SPEAKER_00]: transmitted, and then spread to the apical
meristem followed by the full plant
[SPEAKER_00]: infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a point of infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks later, right down to the roots,
accumulates down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after it accumulates down there,
then it goes back and kind of shows up at
[SPEAKER_00]: the very top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then six weeks later, then it's well
distributed amongst the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowering can also increase the viroid
load.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stress of flowering can increase the
amount of viroid that's present in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows the importance of testing a
plant multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: As early veg, it could be below detectable
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have that viroid, it could be
very low, not really stressed,
[SPEAKER_00]: not really proliferating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing in veg is still important,
as if a positive is found in veg,
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant should be removed immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just because it tested negative in
early veg, following up with another test
[SPEAKER_00]: during flowering would be advised to
ensure that that small, potential small
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid load, then when it becomes much
larger, easier to find and identify,
[SPEAKER_00]: would be worth a second test there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I said, water transmitted,
which is, again, a little bit scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in part how it can travel so fast
to a growing operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants do not even have to come into
direct contact with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can spread infections via water,
transfer contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any recycling water is at risk,
but two common methods occur where the
[SPEAKER_00]: cloner tray transferred only on water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see here where there's a physical
separation between these plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's a water connection,
and that allows that healthy plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: become infected from that unhealthy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And flood and drain growing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see in the cloner where the
viroid was detected two weeks of exposure
[SPEAKER_00]: of healthy roots and a solution containing
infected roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no physical root contact,
but clearly we could see that it is able
[SPEAKER_00]: to basically go through that water and
take down healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also on a tray where they're physically
separated, water going between the two,
[SPEAKER_00]: that far it goes from one to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also infected mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since the viroid is systemic to the
plant, cloning the plant will produce many
[SPEAKER_00]: infected offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not advised you take cuttings or
clippings from an infected mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also why testing and retesting
mother plants is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: All cuttings pictured tested positive for
hoplite-viroid infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get a mother that's positive,
remove that mother and do not take any
[SPEAKER_00]: clones from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll just be spreading the infection
even faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now seed transmission gets a little
confusing here and showed that when female
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are infected, this can increase the
odds or the percentages of the seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: are infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the hoplite viroid found is on the
outside of the seed coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 to 15% infection can still be found on
the inside of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the seedling, typically cotyledon,
has any physical damage, the hoplite
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid can easily enter the plant from the
seed coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a prime example here where that
seedling is kind of coming out and
[SPEAKER_00]: unfurling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seed coat might still be attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a little physical abrasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if that hoplite viroid is right on
the seed coat, it can easily now get into
[SPEAKER_00]: this very young plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also present in dry flowers,
so it's not just the super young plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be the fully mature and
harvested dry flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40% sample from dispensaries did show
positive for hoplite viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this study was done in California,
I believe, which shows how widespread it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also found in male flowers,
so it's another reason for concern that
[SPEAKER_00]: just because you're only using it for
breeding purposes, you don't want to have
[SPEAKER_00]: any male flowers or male plants that have
the hoplite viroid as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glove transmitted survives on sap on
gloves up to five days at room
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, showing how very stable it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're discarding your gloves
after trimming, discard them in a trash
[SPEAKER_00]: can and leave them there and get that out
and removed from any part of the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that stable can survive for five days
even at warm temperatures, which would be
[SPEAKER_00]: considered room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf transfer can survive for four weeks,
so be sure to clean and remove leaves that
[SPEAKER_00]: are being trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's important for your gloves
to be disposed of and physically removed
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Survival on dried leaves tested one,
two, three, and four weeks later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four weeks will still get positive there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that just shows you the stability of
hoplite and viroid and how easily it can
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer from material that growers might
be not worried about or not thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can really do any harm to their
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That root tissue, ever important root
tissue, it's very stable viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heating it to 70 degrees Celsius,
which is about 158 degrees Fahrenheit for
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 minutes did not destroy the RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The RNA is kind of looped over itself,
very, very stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has a great longevity in the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just speaks to the reason why it's
probably become so prevalent in the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing world right now because it's so
stable that it's able to transfer very
[SPEAKER_00]: easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it gets kind of established,
it's very hard to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those male flowers that I mentioned,
at this time there's no real evidence that
[SPEAKER_00]: hoplite viroid can be present in the
pollen, but it can be present in the male
[SPEAKER_00]: flower structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be found in the male flowers as
well as in the anthers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unconfirmed in pollen and no evidence
of transmission yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's saying it doesn't happen,
but this is at least not right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently obvious that it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, another reason for concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even in breeding, if you're like,
oh, I'm not going to grow that plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce flowers, for dried flower,
while you're breeding with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: still a reason for concern, still a reason
to remove that plant from your operation
[SPEAKER_00]: to hopefully reduce the overall viroid
load.
So that's why I'm saying it doesn't
happen.
So that's why I'm saying it doesn't
happen.
