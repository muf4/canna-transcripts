[SPEAKER_00]: So when growing plants, it's always wise
to have a check and balance system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like the government here,
between the justice, we want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that we also have a balance system,
a way just to check to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's running efficiently as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a system to check conditions,
it could be a checklist, mental checklist,
[SPEAKER_00]: a written checklist, all good ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Setting timers that are friendly to your
schedule, such as lights and irrigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: also benefit this, meaning it could be
getting up in the morning making sure the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights are on or at night, making sure the
lights go off, something that's friendly
[SPEAKER_00]: to your schedule, especially if you're
growing in completely controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, just so you have a way of just
kind of double checking to make sure the
[SPEAKER_00]: timers are all working properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consistency for plants and for growers is
a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can help ensure accuracy predictions
for the plants and also provide the
[SPEAKER_00]: growers with early identification when
something isn't going right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having anything right in the line and all
set, something that gets out of line,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very easy quickly to identify that to
minimize the impact that it'll have on the
[SPEAKER_00]: overall growth cycle of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan for failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have a backup products ready to go if
you know they're eventually going to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, don't just have one water
pump and that's all that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a backup of the same size so it makes
your quick and easy change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light bulbs, you know they're going to
age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reflectors, you don't have to be changing
those as well as timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any one of these things could fail without
notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure you're going
through and changing that out as quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: as you can identify the problem instead of
having to order that and having
[SPEAKER_00]: inconsistencies or having something that's
not able to work properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ventilation, you want to make sure you
have sufficient ventilation as this will
[SPEAKER_00]: cause thermal stratification and will
expose plants to variations in
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure you're having a
fan to help move some air around,
[SPEAKER_00]: help decrease disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also making sure the carbon dioxide is
getting mixed well in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also having a fan will help reduce the
chance of getting weaker stocks because if
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have ventilation, weaker stocks
will develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could be if a fan goes out and
you're not planning for that and the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's going through a rapid growth
phase, weaker stocks could develop as the
[SPEAKER_00]: end result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lack of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So poor light can reduce yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduced light can also increase the
plant's tendency to stretch and get leggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be an extreme example of a
really stretchy, leggy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also increase the odds of plant
damage not only in place but if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going through moving it from a vegetative
room to a flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, you want to have consistent
irrigation to the plants because not
[SPEAKER_00]: having regular irrigation can cause undue
plant stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, these plants are going to be
drinking, these plants are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: needing irrigation and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure they're constantly
fed that because you don't want to stunt
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants because that can lead to
long-term damage, especially if it occurs
[SPEAKER_00]: early in the growth and development of
those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also does not allow the grow to know if or
when something might be going wrong or
[SPEAKER_00]: failing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having the system of checking,
if you're using a barrel system,
[SPEAKER_00]: a meter, some way of assessing the
irrigation or the water moisture content
[SPEAKER_00]: in the irrigation medium, that is all very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those irrigation events should be regular,
should have an idea when they're coming
[SPEAKER_00]: on, should know how much water you're
giving the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, this may change over the
growing season as the plants get bigger,
[SPEAKER_00]: but having that check and balance system
for all of these parameters is advised
[SPEAKER_00]: because it helps you identify issues early
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decreasing the chance that it could have a
large negative impact on your final
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
