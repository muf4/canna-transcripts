[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
we're going to look at cannabis breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: and the transmission of hop-latent viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so if you're looking at creating new
seeds and doing some breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: you still need to be concerned about
hop-latent viroid, and particularly how
[SPEAKER_00]: the cross is being made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the description, there is a link to
some further research where I got some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these slides of images from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to dive into that and
provide a brief overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is looking at infectious infected
female plants have a higher transmission
[SPEAKER_00]: of hop-latent viroid than when the male
plant is infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see that here with experiment
one, positive females, negative females,
[SPEAKER_00]: positive females with a negative male,
negative females with a positive male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viroid was present in the seed coat and
inside the seed when the females were
[SPEAKER_00]: positive, viroid present on the seed coat
and inside the seeds when the male was
[SPEAKER_00]: infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we see the transmission rate higher or
greater percentage when the females were
[SPEAKER_00]: infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still crossover infection even when the
male pollen is basically transferred from
[SPEAKER_00]: one to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be as high as 43 percent in seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the contamination is found on the
outside of the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important we're kind of looking at
this comparison here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows the basics of the design.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is looking at some of the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Females were positive, males were
negative, and we could see higher fraction
[SPEAKER_00]: with hop-latent viroid compared to when
the opposite was true.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the females were deemed to be clean
and the males were infected with
[SPEAKER_00]: hop-latent viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still transmission, but to a lower degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: They quantified it with 31 out of 71 or
43.7 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Varies from mother to mother and ranges
from 23 to 53.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be as low as 23, as high as
53, on average 43.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where testing is really
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even for breeders, even if you're like,
oh, it's just a male plant set in the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen, it can still transfer over to that
next generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are limitations in the sense
that the hop-latent viroid cannot become
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the genome of the particular
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is existing in some exterior structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not integrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of the chromosomal structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to help us to be able to
find a way to hopefully stop this viroid
[SPEAKER_00]: from spreading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can it do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it can impact the epigenetics or the
expression of genetics in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is looking at this RNA base,
but it can reverse transcriptases,
[SPEAKER_00]: go back to DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, we're looking at coding for
different proteins and leading to gene
[SPEAKER_00]: expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you get those different
funky, weird-shaped leaves, those
[SPEAKER_00]: depressed internodal spacings,
those yellow colorations to leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what hop-latent viroid can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where's hop-latent viroid in the actual
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the viroid load, I should say,
is throughout the entire plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but can be variable at least initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple samples of the entire plant
should be taken when submitting a sample
[SPEAKER_00]: for screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's as important to screen your
male plants as well as your female plants
[SPEAKER_00]: for those looking at doing breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if the plant is very young,
we might want to sample the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're growing a mother plant or a
longtime breeding male plant, it will
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly, in about six weeks, spread
throughout the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the key part with this is
screening, testing, and repeat testing to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure you know your plants are clean and
you're not having any part of the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: process with that hop-latent viroid,
even if you're just using the male plants
[SPEAKER_00]: for their pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
