[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to cover some common
cannabis nutrient deficiencies and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the characteristic looks that these may
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here all these plants' leaves
don't look quite right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it is due to light damage but
other abiotic factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some is also related to nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to distinguish and identify
those is important to any efficient grow
[SPEAKER_00]: operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off we're looking at nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to consider mobile versus immobile
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mobile can be translocated from older
growth to newer growth tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that the deficiency of these
nutrients will first show up in the older
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of being stolen from those older
leaves and shifted to those newer growing
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Immobile nutrients are essentially fixed
in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like the broken down car kind
of represents in the plant and as a result
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't translocate very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the newer growth will tend to show
those first signs of deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at nutrients we want to
classify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three main categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: The primary nutrients are the major
nutrients needed by the plants in large
[SPEAKER_00]: quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the three numbers on the
fertilizer, the NPK, the nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus, and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondary nutrients are needed in smaller
quantities than primary nutrients and the
[SPEAKER_00]: three secondary nutrients are calcium,
magnesium, and sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly we have the micronutrients and
these are required nutrients by the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: but in very small quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common micronutrients are boron,
chlorine, copper, iron, manganese,
[SPEAKER_00]: molybdenum, nickel, and zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we look at fertilizer options
there's chelated fertilizers and these
[SPEAKER_00]: chelated fertilizers are often more stable
and plant available sources of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something if possible to get these are
usually advised because this improves the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer use efficiency by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilizers in this category can often be
used as foliar applications applied to the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to being media applied which
can help reduce the time the plant remains
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into some of the nutrients
deficiency here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we'll start with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mobile nutrient often associated
with the degree of green that the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deficiency is yielding of lower leaves and
fertilizer recommendations are urea,
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium nitrate, or blood meal if you're
looking at a pure organic option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at this example here of
nitrogen deficiency we could see the newer
[SPEAKER_00]: growth is green and the older growth is
yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the nitrogen is mobile so it's
being stolen from these older leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: pushed to the newer growth at least at the
early onset.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is allowed to continue eventually
all the leaves will turn yellow but that
[SPEAKER_00]: initial onset that nitrogen is being moved
by the plant to that newer material here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it looks nice and green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus is also a mobile nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often associated with adding for
increased root growth and flower
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deficiency is characterized by a purple
coloration of the leaves as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though this is not the only possible
cause for purple coloration other stresses
[SPEAKER_00]: can also call purple color that is
something that's typically associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triple superphosphate is a great
fertilizer to remedy that and also manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the amount of bloom fertilizers most
growers use this tends not to be an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's typically the other case where
growers are over adding a phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium is a mobile nutrient often
associated with sugar in production of
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deficiency is emmited by yielding of the
leaf margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the margins are the very outside of
the leaves here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we see in this image.
[SPEAKER_00]: These margins are yellowing and this is a
clear indication that this plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably showing potassium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result sulfate potassium or potassium
chloride are recommended as fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind potassium chloride has higher
nutrient content about 10% more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere around 60% of potassium but also
has a greater salt content than potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfate which is about 50% potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again you want to weigh different
fertilizer options but at least knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant is potassium deficient gives
you a great way to target particular
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer within your plan so that this
doesn't happen in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium is an immobile nutrient often
associated with cell division and
[SPEAKER_00]: formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deficiency is emmited by something of
newer growth that typically has brown
[SPEAKER_00]: spots and are poorly forming a flower or
blossoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've grown tomatoes very familiar with
calcium deficiency as blossom and rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the calcium is simply not getting
through all the tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilizer recommendations, botanical cal
mag max and bio-min calcium are examples
[SPEAKER_00]: of plant available calcium fertilizers
that can help remedy this potential
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnesium is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a mobile nutrient often associated
with proper chlorophyll formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deficiency is emmited by what's called
interveinal yielding of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilizer recommendations are epsom
salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That interveinal yellowing, this is a good
comparison while not cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_00]: between adequate magnesium to low
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: The veins maintain their green color and
in between them we start to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: yellowing that develops.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfur is another immobile nutrient often
associated with nitrogen fixation in a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deficiencies look similar to magnesium but
tend to be more even yellowing,
[SPEAKER_00]: not broken up yellow spots like the
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be of greater concern in colder
soils in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically that newer growth will show that
overall dulling or yellowing coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epsom salt is recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to avoid adding straight sulfur
as this will also change the pH of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copper is another immobile nutrient and
while not very common it can have severe
[SPEAKER_00]: negative impact on yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often associated with bud formation and
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: In deficiencies in the younger leaves the
tip or margin or discoloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the kind of tip of this leaf
curling up and looking kind of that
[SPEAKER_00]: brownish.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of characteristic of a copper
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copper sulfate or other chelated copper
products would be advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are spraying them on the leaves be
careful because it can cause a chance or
[SPEAKER_00]: greater chance of leaf burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron is another immobile nutrient often
associated chlorophyll production and
[SPEAKER_00]: great plant metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deficiency is evident by the upper leaves
turning yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often confused with nitrogen
deficiency as the yellowing looks similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to nitrogen but again lower leaves in the
iron for the upper leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nitrogen will occur in the lower
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron occurs in these upper leaves here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to watch the pH and particularly
high phosphorus can negatively impact the
[SPEAKER_00]: availability of iron to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chelated forms of iron would be advised to
correct this potential deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly we have manganese Mn, an immobile
nutrient often associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis, respiration and root cell
elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deficiencies have some resemblance to iron
deficiency as it's intervening the
[SPEAKER_00]: yellowing and chlorosis of the newer
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see it looks a little different
than the iron is kind of that more even
[SPEAKER_00]: tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilizer recommendations would be
manganese sulfate or if you're using age
[SPEAKER_00]: old grow the grow blend has shown elevated
levels of manganese based on tissue tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again some fertilizers will have higher
of one of these kind of more minor
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients so by tissue testing and testing
your plants you can have an idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly how that fertilizer may react to
the plant and what fertilizer you may use
[SPEAKER_00]: if you are starting to notice in the
beginnings of a deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: The earlier you can catch it the quicker
you can correct it and the reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: the problem you'll have in your end result
in yield.
Thank you.
