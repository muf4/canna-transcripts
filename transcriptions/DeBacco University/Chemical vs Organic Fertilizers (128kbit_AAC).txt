[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to discuss a little
bit that is often debated of should I be
[SPEAKER_00]: using chemical fertilizers or should I be
using organic fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm also trying to give you a
background about a little bit of what
[SPEAKER_00]: defines each and to give you that
appreciation for when it might be best to
[SPEAKER_00]: use one or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, chemical fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put those in quotes here because all
nutrients come down to chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But chemical fertilizers is typically
what's referred to a manufactured product,
[SPEAKER_00]: a man-made, man-created product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus organic tends to refer to something
that naturally appears.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within those chemical fertilizers are
often water soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you add in the water, they'll kind
of diffuse through and mix very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes, because they mix so well,
this makes the application process very
[SPEAKER_00]: easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This form is very friendly to a variety of
irrigation methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use them in hydroponic setups,
drip irrigation, systems that use a water
[SPEAKER_00]: tank as a reservoir, overhead,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these irrigation methods are
applicable for most chemical fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, with the ease of application,
this can help a grower maintain a very
[SPEAKER_00]: clean operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually in a bag, it can take a spoonful,
take an exact amount out and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: everything nice and clean and neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers can also precisely, it's called
spoon feeding additions, where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking the exact amount, very small amount
here and exactly adding it to the,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully, happy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, caution must be taken not to
over-apply these fertilizers, which
[SPEAKER_00]: increases the odds of burning the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chemical fertilizers, because they're
easy to be added, sometimes can be
[SPEAKER_00]: over-added, and as a result, there's a
chance a grower could burn their plants if
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't follow the right ratios and the
right feeding regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in contrast to that, organic
fertilizers are not manufactured.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're typically found in nature in one
form or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're considered to be natural
fertilizers, such as seaweed, manure,
[SPEAKER_00]: morn castings, bone meal, blood meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole bunch of variety,
but they're typically thought of as
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because the term organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrients released is typically a
slower release than those chemical-based
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers, and the applications can be
more limiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be very difficult, for example,
to spread manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't necessarily run that through
some irrigation systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could clog drip tapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could cause a odor to develop in
reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, as a result, it can be more
limiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it is still possible to over-add
and create toxic conditions to your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially with some manures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manures looking at phosphorus,
in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it is organic and natural,
over-application can still lead to toxic
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions for some nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, just because you're using
organic fertilizers, doesn't mean it's
[SPEAKER_00]: free range and you can do no harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for organic fertilizers, the term
organic has many definitions, and some
[SPEAKER_00]: actually contradict one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the scientific definition of organic
are compounds containing carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the central point of
organic means carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such as organic chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This leading definition is like organic
farming, and it's produced without the use
[SPEAKER_00]: of chemical fertilizers, pesticides,
or other artificial agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So organic does not mean no spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to get that point kind of
across, that if you're buying something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's organically produced, it doesn't
mean it wasn't sprayed with anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means, typically, the items it could
have been sprayed with come from a limited
[SPEAKER_00]: list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that limited list, most organic
growers are using kind of OMRI.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have heard of that term.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stands for the Organic Materials Review
Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a list of over 5,500
products approved for organic production
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the USDA National Organic Program
Standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you see this USDA organic seal.
[SPEAKER_00]: 189 results contain some copper base to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of this 5,500 list of potential
products, almost 190 of them contain some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of copper base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copper can accumulate in the environment
and does not contain carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be mindful of whatever
situation or whatever kind of definition
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: While OMRI is considered by many to be the
gold standard, it does contain products
[SPEAKER_00]: such as those that contain copper that can
potentially harm the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to be mindful of and
understand all about the nutrients and all
[SPEAKER_00]: about the products that you have access to
and utilize them where they're best used.
[SPEAKER_00]: But realize, just because it's organic
doesn't mean you can't over add to the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or cause potential toxicity issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organic material breakdown with many
organic materials, especially manures,
[SPEAKER_00]: the goal is to use them after a sufficient
composting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fresh manures can easily burn plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called hot manures, hot nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, under organic standards,
there's often a required number of days
[SPEAKER_00]: from manure application to harvest of any
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this means you can't apply manure and
then go harvest that field.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be 120 days, 180 days
restriction from when you first apply that
[SPEAKER_00]: manure to when you can harvest off that
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know your source of material
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do get it fresh, be sure to
compost it properly or be sure the source
[SPEAKER_00]: is following a composting procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here they're nice, they're turning their
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it's kind of a stagnant pile coming
out of a barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just kind of know your source,
not only what type of manure it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: but how it's being treated before it comes
to your operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organically grown cannabis, this is kind
of something that anecdotally growers have
[SPEAKER_00]: reported if it's organically grown,
there's improved taste, there's improved
[SPEAKER_00]: aromas compared to a cannabis plant that
may have been treated with chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while this hasn't really been
scientifically proven that there's a true
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between organically grown and
chemically grown, the difference could be
[SPEAKER_00]: in part due to the overall grower
practices and not solely based on the type
[SPEAKER_00]: of fertilizer used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that there's more at play
than just saying, oh, I use organic
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer, I use chemical fertilizer,
because even organic fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're adding are kind of chemical
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be mindful of maybe other growing
practices, because there's been no
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific proof, at least to this point,
that organically grown cannabis will
[SPEAKER_00]: produce any different aromas than a
chemically produced one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that the grower practices
can also influence the plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that the grower practices
can also influence the plant production.
So keep in mind that the grower practices
