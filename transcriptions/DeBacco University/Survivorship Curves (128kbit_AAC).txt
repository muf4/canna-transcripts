[SPEAKER_00]: This is a nice short and brief description
of the three survivorship curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see them evident here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a type 1, type 2, and type 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type 1 is exhibited by humans,
type 2 typically by birds, and type 3 by
[SPEAKER_00]: trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the percentage of maximum life
expectancy and number of individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: surviving based on a log scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So survivorship curves, they provide a way
to express age distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics of the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Survivorship is a percentage of an
original population that survives to a
[SPEAKER_00]: given age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, we have these three
different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type 1 is mortality rises in
post-reproductive years, where individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: die later in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be an example of the
humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type 2, survivorship curves, mortality is
consistent throughout life, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent with many bird species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's type 3, where mortality
is low after establishment, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's a large decline in the young.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not many survive to older age,
but once they get to about that mid-age,
[SPEAKER_00]: many will survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that look graphically?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as we can see here, I'll hang out
with the humans up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type 1 is for humans, where you can see
that the death rate increases later in
[SPEAKER_00]: life down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So further in time is when you're more
likely, sadly, to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun birds is a pretty consistent year to
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frogs, in this example, many die very
early in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then once it establishes itself,
then there's few individuals that do
[SPEAKER_00]: survive to this midpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of those will survive until the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's that steep drop-off early on
that'd be type 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type 2 is that consistent or linear
decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And type 1 is humans, where we're having
that kind of plateau.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very likely to survive to
mid-to-older age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you reach that, then the
survivorship curve will decline rapidly
[SPEAKER_00]: there towards the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that gives you just that quick
organization explanation of the three
[SPEAKER_00]: survivorship curves and the types and how
did they look graphically, and also an
[SPEAKER_00]: explanation of each of them.
