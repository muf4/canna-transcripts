[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to discuss season
extensions, ways to get a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: longer growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different styles,
many different purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see just because you have a
structure doesn't mean you can't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: structure within a structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tall crops, long crops, all different
styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to touch on just the main
points here just to give you an idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: what's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, for season extensions,
there's small styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be just rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are used to help protect very small
plantings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not very tall, low, in a tight
area, areas you might be switching or
[SPEAKER_00]: changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent for that purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still getting the benefits of added heat
and reduced frost potential for damage,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not having to set up a very large or
elaborate structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's your mid-size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caterpillar tunnels are gaining massive
popularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great if you're considering a high tunnel,
but are unsure if you want to commit to
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy to set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've set them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really don't take all that much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little prep work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there's some bolting and some
measuring to do, but overall easily done
[SPEAKER_00]: in a weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, they're great if you're
considering a high tunnel, but are not
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% sure or committed to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can set multiple up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you an idea of what it is like
growing in a protective structure and some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also some of the challenges in growing
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caterpillar tunnels are relatively
inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not very wide, but long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great for long areas of fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, instead of just committing
yourself to one, you could easily do two
[SPEAKER_00]: and it offers a lot of flexibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are also pretty easy to move if you
wanted to do crop rotations, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Larger styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are your true high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to grants, they become very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Springing them all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get more than one though,
try to get two the same size.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it a lot easier for management
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have advantages, but need to be taken
care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plastic should be removed during the
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the structure should be able to be
moved, and it should be moved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't be a permanent structure in
one solid location.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should have the option of being moved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason being is you leave it in that
one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can lead up to the buildup of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get a lot of leaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also have pest issues and problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why these aren't greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called high tunnels because
they're able to be moved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So high tunnels versus a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, high tunnels are temporary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have an extra heat source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here, they're just
literally tunnels that are tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouses are more permanent structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have paved and solid floors,
a high degree of climate control,
[SPEAKER_00]: heaters, coolers, exhaust fans,
a lot of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could have hanging lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot more of a permanent structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: True high tunnels are just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're usually placed in fields,
and they're tunnels that are high,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're just aiding and extending that
growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very important part, whether you have a
small one, a mid-sized or a large one,
[SPEAKER_00]: or even a greenhouse, is keeping the
structure clean inside and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can often be overlooked, especially
when they're brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look very nice, and they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've got to maintain that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduce the potential for disease carryover
is the number one reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to limit your local pest
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean it, sweeping up the floors,
making sure there's not a lot of residue,
[SPEAKER_00]: and don't use it as storage for certain
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not letting crops die in there and then
just leaving them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going through washing the plastic,
even, as you take it down, the inside,
[SPEAKER_00]: the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important to keep them clean in
and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of a relatively
good-sized high tunnel here, showing you
[SPEAKER_00]: what it can look like in season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and clean here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to visit this farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see only here a couple of
clippings here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing some pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look how clean it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top, bottom, and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to have a microenvironment
here that can increase your own pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: of pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, extending your season,
extend it early, as in the March,
[SPEAKER_00]: April, May timeframe, or late,
September, October, November.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is early, is that you can get a
jump on the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often get ahead of pest pressure,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Late in the season, you can continue the
Thanksgiving meal if you're delivering
[SPEAKER_00]: that for someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the pest pressure can be higher,
though, later in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a word of caution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting a little bit later and
maintaining them, keeping them clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially as they're late-season crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early in the season, you tend not to have
as many problems, but still, worthwhile,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it clean so you don't have any
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, pushing that season early and late
can be great, but it reduces your
[SPEAKER_00]: off-season, so keep that in mind.
Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
