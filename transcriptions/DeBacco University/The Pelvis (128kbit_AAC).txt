[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing with our skeletal system,
we've arrived at the pelvis and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to learn about the bones that are
fused together that make up this structure
[SPEAKER_00]: that you may have heard of called the hip
bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these hip bones, it's important that
they're very strong and maintain their
[SPEAKER_00]: integrity because the total weight of the
upper body rests on this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: This region also protects several organs,
such as the reproductive organs,
[SPEAKER_00]: the urinary bladder, and portions of the
large intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the area where the femur articulates
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pelvis is composed of three fused
bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not independently mobile,
they are fused together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the ilium, located here,
the ischium, located here in purple,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the pubic bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sacrum, which is in green here and
here, anterior and posterior view,
[SPEAKER_00]: is part of the vertebrae.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important that we make that
distinction of separation that is
[SPEAKER_00]: technically not part of the pelvis region
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that hip bone, you can see here again,
are three bones composed together,
[SPEAKER_00]: fused together, make that hip bone up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, that sacrum is part of the
vertebral column and is not part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: total hip bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gender differences of the pelvis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to identify a skeleton as
being male or female, you typically look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the hip bone here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, rather than memorize degrees and
numbers for women, it's 80 to 85,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit wider angle, which help with
the birthing process in men, 50 to 60
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's kind of a little trick here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take your hand and the angle
formed, the pubic arch, is approximately
[SPEAKER_00]: the angle between the thumb and index
finger, that would be indicated that would
[SPEAKER_00]: be a woman skeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if the angle between the index
finger and the middle finger, if it
[SPEAKER_00]: matches this, then we're looking at it's
probably a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can help you identify quickly a
male or female skeleton by simply looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the pelvis in the degree that we find
here at the pubic arch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
