[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over passive point
[SPEAKER_00]: injection for carbon dioxide delivery
related to cannabis plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, if you're thinking about
implementing one of these systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's go over some things you should be
aware of if you're using passive point
[SPEAKER_00]: injection as a method of delivering carbon
dioxide for your growing space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, passive point injection.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is by far the simplest setup compared
to all the other options that exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if used at all, it should only be
in situations that have very limited
[SPEAKER_00]: number of plants, basically no more than
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spaces should be kept relatively small.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can cause high concentrations of
carbon dioxide in small growing areas
[SPEAKER_00]: leading to uneven conditions within the
grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it does offer some simplicity,
there is also some drawbacks to this
[SPEAKER_00]: design as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're adding carbon dioxide,
you still will have some benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: The addition of carbon dioxide will
provide the plant benefits, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: assuming all other conditions are not
limiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are going through the trouble
of setting up a carbon dioxide enrichment
[SPEAKER_00]: system, you want to make sure that it's as
efficient as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as we're talking about our ambient
levels around 400, yes, as we increase
[SPEAKER_00]: those, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we want to make sure we're
consistently having levels above the
[SPEAKER_00]: ambient levels to get the most benefit
from our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in large grow rooms, as we can kind of
see here, if this simple point injection
[SPEAKER_00]: system is used, there's a chance that
there will be differences, notice,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plants that are close to compared
to those plants that are far from the
[SPEAKER_00]: point of injection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for large areas, be sure to factor in a
delivery system, which can often be
[SPEAKER_00]: forgotten about despite its simplicity and
its also necessity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure all plants are
getting equal distribution, so you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting an equal, consistent grow,
not getting some that are much more
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive and some that are much less,
simply because you did not equally
[SPEAKER_00]: distribute your carbon dioxide that you're
enriching in this example of a larger room.
