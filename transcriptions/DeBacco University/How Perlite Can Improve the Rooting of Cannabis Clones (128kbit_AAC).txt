[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
we're going to take a look and see how
[SPEAKER_00]: perlite can improve your rooting in your
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're using Oasis and put one of
those trays that's commonly done,
[SPEAKER_00]: adding some perlite to the bottom right
when you take your clones is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wait a little bit, a couple of
days, and then add it, you're going to see
[SPEAKER_00]: in this video when you go out to the
greenhouse, the comparison between adding
[SPEAKER_00]: it right away and just adding it just a
couple of days later and the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: when you take those clones, saturating
that Oasis, putting perlite in the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then adding your clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go out to the greenhouse and
let's take a look to see the comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, if you want a little tip if you're
using Oasis cubes for your clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: a way to help encourage rooting,
we'll have to add a little perlite below
[SPEAKER_00]: that Oasis so that plant isn't soaking in
that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at some of the ones we have
here as an example, we'll look at these
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these had this perlite added a little
bit late.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was kind of when we first saw the
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here we're seeing, you know,
pretty good rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's plants right next to it,
the same age it had the perlite put in
[SPEAKER_00]: right at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did they look or how is their
rooting a little different?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we can commonly agree that
there's definitely better rooting on these
[SPEAKER_00]: that had the perlite added at the very
beginning versus these that had added a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit later, really when we saw the
total results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty good stark difference there
between adding perlite from the start or
[SPEAKER_00]: adding a little bit later when you're
getting up your Oasis, for your clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: add that perlite right in there as a
beginning step, and you too can have good
[SPEAKER_00]: rooting as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, quick look at the rooting
comparison, those that had added later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are the ones that had it added
from the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much better rooting here than over here,
indicating just that little bit of air
[SPEAKER_00]: really helps those roots explode,
go through, develop good clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally wouldn't recommend cutting
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to leave full leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see here, as far as a rooting
base, definitely that perlite helps those
[SPEAKER_00]: roots breathe a little bit more and
hopefully will increase your success in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cloning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
Thanks for watching.
