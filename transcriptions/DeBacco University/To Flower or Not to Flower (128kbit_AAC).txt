[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers will often wonder,
should I be flowering my plants or should
[SPEAKER_00]: I be waiting?
[SPEAKER_00]: What should I be doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: When should I kind of signal that plant to
go into flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll look at just a couple things that
might help you clarify this and determine
[SPEAKER_00]: when to make that change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind that photo period
dictates vegetative or the flowering phase
[SPEAKER_00]: for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants can be switched to flower or
even reverted back to vegetative stage for
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning if desired by the grower based on
the photo period that they're exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that for most varieties,
the grower has control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's up to the grower to decide when
it's most advantageous to make that
[SPEAKER_00]: transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that flower timing, remember auto
flowering cultivars will flower based on
[SPEAKER_00]: days old, not on the photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: All others, indicas and sativas,
will be dependent on the photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are putting those auto flowering
varieties, you don't have to worry about
[SPEAKER_00]: making the switch to flower or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can almost mark on a calendar or get
an approximate idea of when they should be
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering just to give you an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, if you're growing indicas or
sativas, you can kind of pick or choose
[SPEAKER_00]: the date you want, change the photo period
and induce flowering on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes when to flower depends on
simply the room height.
[SPEAKER_00]: How tall can your plants get?
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not want your plants to outgrow
their vertical space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can indicate or tell a grower when
they should be inducing flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know how far the plant should be from the
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are ceiling limited,
it will dictate when you flip the photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, especially for some
areas, might be in a grow tent or facility
[SPEAKER_00]: with low ceilings, this can help make the
decision for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in an area here, we have a large
area, you have more options, but sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: your lights might be fixed in a certain
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can help limit your decisions and
allow you to time out the proper period to
[SPEAKER_00]: switch the vegetative state to the
flowering state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also should know your cultivar or the
general habits of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indicas can grow about 25 to 50% more in
vertical height while they are in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativas can potentially double their
height during the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, sativas have that kind of
longer, taller appearance and indicas are
[SPEAKER_00]: more that kind of squattier appearance
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, knowing the cultivar that you're
using can also help make an informed
[SPEAKER_00]: decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your starting material should also be a
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did the original plant material come from
seed or from a clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones can grow in height quickly,
but make sure if you are growing from a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone that they do have a sufficient root
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's two clones pulled from an aeroponic
cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this one hasn't rooted yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's just starting, which you want
to let this one probably go for a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit longer to allow it to have sufficient
root system to be able to support itself
[SPEAKER_00]: through the rest of the vegetative phase
and so that you have a healthy plant going
[SPEAKER_00]: into flowering.
