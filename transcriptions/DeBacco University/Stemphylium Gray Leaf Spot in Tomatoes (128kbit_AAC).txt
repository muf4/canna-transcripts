[SPEAKER_01]: In this DeBacco University video,
we're going to be looking at Stemophilium
[SPEAKER_01]: gray leaf spot in tomatoes in great
detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only through images, as we can see
here, we're actually going to go into a
[SPEAKER_01]: high tunnel here from the grower,
see what they're experiencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also go on the microscopic levels,
you can see what this disease actually
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like under the microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, some new scientific research,
looking at the genetics and how we may be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to breed resistant varieties going
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so let's look at Stemophilium
gray leaf spot in tomatoes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I said, multiple views, we're going
to look at description of the disease,
[SPEAKER_01]: actual images and video of a known case,
comparison to a common lookalike,
[SPEAKER_01]: a microscopic view, as well as a genetic
investigation regarding the virulence
[SPEAKER_01]: factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with just the basics here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what are we dealing with here
about Stemophilium?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, while it may seem like a new
problem, gray leaf spot in tomato was
[SPEAKER_01]: first reported actually way back in 1930.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are four different Stemophilium
species here, all provided here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to kind of cover them in more
of a general case here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does cause them is there is high
humidity or free water on leaf surfaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's required for the spore
germination as well as infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spots on leaves are small, light brown and
somewhat circular to irregular in shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some larger spots can be seen that are
cracked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Symptoms do start to appear within two to
five days of an infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can get an idea of the rate of
spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the dispersal of this particular
fungal pathogen is via air currents or
[SPEAKER_01]: wind, also splashing of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can also be seed borne and it also
survives on crop debris as a saprophite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to make sure you're cleaning
your fields and removing those of any
[SPEAKER_01]: cases that you think you might have had.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of a zoomed in version here
of what the different leaves kind of look
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have the upper portion and then
that same leaf I turned around and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: see the under portion of that same leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what you're kind of not seeing here is
a lot of yellow haloing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeing this brown coloration and almost
the centers are tan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that tan kind of coloration in the
center with that darker brown region can
[SPEAKER_01]: be an indication that you may have a case
of stemophilium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here's just another look here showing
a little bit more of advanced symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, upper and lower leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: This more advanced progression is evident
by this large kind of browning area and
[SPEAKER_01]: the larger lesions located under side of
the leaf here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little different than we just saw
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are earlier symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are a little bit later stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeking an idea of what it might progress
to if you're looking at it on a leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now full leaf view here.
[SPEAKER_01]: See just a little leaflets there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The images shown are lower leaves here
just above the pruning point for this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are exhibiting more advanced symptoms
and we can clearly see that evident right
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this grower was pruning the lower
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just above those and these are a
little bit higher up showing those early
[SPEAKER_01]: signs which is when you want to actually
catch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now looking here, if you do look in the
detailed view, the rachis or the petioles
[SPEAKER_01]: here, this is when inspecting these areas
closely look for potentially a small
[SPEAKER_01]: rectangular legion.
[SPEAKER_01]: These can be difficult to find but
something else to be aware of when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that they're here and there's
clearly an evident of one right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, not widespread but just something
else to look for when you're doing that
[SPEAKER_01]: field diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here I'm going to go through a high
tunnel video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it is recorded and uploaded in 4k so I
would recommend that you do pause the
[SPEAKER_01]: video if you need to and kind of bring up
that HD so you can see the details.
[SPEAKER_01]: This case was officially lab-confirmed
case of stemophilium.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first symptoms did occur around
mid-July which is about four weeks prior,
[SPEAKER_01]: about a month prior to the video being
taken at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does typically start in the older
leaves and works its way up the plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: different varieties will have different
levels of severity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully you liked the quick little
video here of the high tunnel we get to
[SPEAKER_01]: hear from the actual grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright so here we are in the high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take a look at the
stemophilium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what we really can see is that
browning of the tomato leaf here and we
[SPEAKER_01]: notice that there's the small browning
area but also the larger browning area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Notice how there's no yellowing or haloing
effect of that yellow around any of those
[SPEAKER_01]: spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now as you look our way up the plant we'll
notice that the upper portions tend to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a normal green coloration with no spotting
and we notice those spottings are more
[SPEAKER_01]: prevalent on the lower ends of those
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're noticing here again a lower
look.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know the bottom branches have all been
pruned out and removed so keep that in
[SPEAKER_01]: mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at that distinctive brown
coloration and that kind of tan center
[SPEAKER_01]: with no yellow hailing is the key part
here to the visual indication that you
[SPEAKER_01]: might have a stemophilium.
[SPEAKER_01]: That browning again as far as goes doesn't
really form circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tends to form more of a irregular
pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at the upper portion of the leaf a
little bit more advanced symptoms there as
[SPEAKER_01]: I flip the leaf over you can see the
underside of the leaf as well there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those have very advanced cases
others are just starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another last look here showing you kind of
that early starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again this plant was officially diagnosed
so this is a sample was taken to the lab
[SPEAKER_01]: brought here back and now we're able to
look and identify this is exactly the
[SPEAKER_01]: cause and this is the early stages of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this would be when it would be
important to go through and identify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or have a reason of concern to bring a
sample to the lab yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we can see those browning again that
can expand out and cover a portion of the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf but we're really just have that
browning to tanning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's now go to the grower and hear
what they have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed there was spotting throughout
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had noticed some what I thought was
botrytis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like alternary but sprinkled
throughout the plants and I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen that before but the
spotting was throughout the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some varieties it just is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't seem to have any effect on
yields or plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some varieties it was almost like septoria
but work its way up the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marnoir which is a hylum from Johnny's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing it because it's leaf mold
resistant because we had awful leaf mold
[SPEAKER_00]: last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully you liked that little grower
interview there where they got to explain
[SPEAKER_01]: what they were seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now do keep in mind that fact sheets tend
to report that cherry and grape tomatoes
[SPEAKER_01]: are more susceptible than other types but
based on the grower observation here we
[SPEAKER_01]: saw it did not show on I did show on all
the cherry varieties so keep that in mind
[SPEAKER_01]: but it did not really seem to have much
negative impacts in regard to overall
[SPEAKER_01]: plant performance in the all important
yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does most commonly occur at least is first
seen in high tunnels with higher
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures and humidity being favorable
for the disease development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we also heard in the kind of grower
talk there that they thought it initially
[SPEAKER_01]: looked like septoria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is kind of like a lookalike to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Semephyllium is often mistaken for the
septoria leaf spot this in early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind that semephyllium this leaf
right here has more irregular lesions with
[SPEAKER_01]: brown margins and tan centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves tend to remain green in areas
that are unaffected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in contrast that to septoria this
tends to be more circular spots with in
[SPEAKER_01]: the inner circle a lighter shade of brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition the leaf will typically yellow
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little comparison there between a
common lookalike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when you look at under the microscope
if you are fortunate to be able to do that
[SPEAKER_01]: we have the knidia here on the left and
the knidia fours here on the right giving
[SPEAKER_01]: you the idea of the size and kind of their
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the knidia fours here are specialized
hyphal branches of some fungi that produce
[SPEAKER_01]: knidia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is kind of the regular kind of
spacing that we see here and just gives
[SPEAKER_01]: you a really good zoomed in clear image of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the knidia they have two great images
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the asexual spore producing on
the knidia four of certain fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the surface view and you can see
that nice textured surface view here of
[SPEAKER_01]: the knidia of semephyllium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the sectioned view here we're looking
at kind of getting away from that surface
[SPEAKER_01]: area what it looks like here on this
sectioned view.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another good visual identification if
you are fortunate to be able to look at
[SPEAKER_01]: this under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I promise going to get into some of
the genetics here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So recently published research article
here looks at the NLP gene which does
[SPEAKER_01]: encode for necrosis and ethylene-inducing
peptide 1, abbreviated NP1 like proteins
[SPEAKER_01]: called NLP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when we're looking at all the data
here you might want to pause the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to cover over the brief
overview of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the wild type here so that's kind
of what it would look like under normal
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions and then we have gene knockouts
and we have over expressing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at the graphs here that kind of
represent the same leaves that were grown
[SPEAKER_01]: on the plant and then removed only for the
image.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see the wild type the gene knockouts
here showing less or smaller lesion sizes
[SPEAKER_01]: than those that were upregulated there
looking at this particular gene there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what are the study findings?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I know they found out quite a bit
so it's great to look at some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: details.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was not particularly from the study
but does kind of highlight some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: lesions that we're talking about and
through their analysis of the NLP gene
[SPEAKER_01]: which remember encodes for necrosis and
ethylene-inducing peptide 1 like proteins,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was found that targeted disruption of
the NLP gene in stemophilium significantly
[SPEAKER_01]: compromised its virulence in tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: The NLP suppressed the production of
reactive oxygen species, abbreviated ROS,
[SPEAKER_01]: in tomato leaves during stemophilium
infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Expressing the fungal NLP in tomato
resulted in constitutive transcription of
[SPEAKER_01]: immune response genes and inhibited plant
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a great kind of target area
when we're looking at developing potential
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant varieties as far as we got it
down to the actual gene that is defining
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially the virulence factor for this
disease in tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just kind of the last little bit right
here, NLP might contribute to the
[SPEAKER_01]: virulence of stemophilium by suppressing
the RS immunity in tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Large scale functional genomic studies are
required to further dissect the
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogeneticity of stemophilium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is kind of an early indication but
shows promise as a way we might be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: suppress this disease going forward but at
least now you've got a little bit of an
[SPEAKER_01]: idea of what to look for in the field as
well as under the microscope if you think
[SPEAKER_01]: you potentially have this fungal disease
on your tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
