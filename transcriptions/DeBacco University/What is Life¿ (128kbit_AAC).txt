[SPEAKER_00]: Here and welcome to what is biology where
we're going to seek to answer that
[SPEAKER_00]: question here provide a little background
for you Well
[SPEAKER_00]: the obvious question when we're looking at
biology well bio means life and ology
[SPEAKER_00]: means the subject of study So therefore
biology is the study of life, but that
[SPEAKER_00]: brings in the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is life?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at what life is life
is basically individual components that
[SPEAKER_00]: will result in a behavior you see that
here with this newly hatched sea turtle
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at these individual
components we want to take something and
[SPEAKER_00]: break it down into those individual
components take maybe an organism and
[SPEAKER_00]: break it down into some of the tissues
some of the potential organs or the cells
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're seeing someone chucking a
corn this kind of gives us the idea of the
[SPEAKER_00]: layers that can be involved in some of the
smaller structures that can be located
[SPEAKER_00]: within for example the cells these little
corn kernels here you can think about them
[SPEAKER_00]: as kind of like the cells that represent
the individual in cellular organization
[SPEAKER_00]: all living things are composed of at least
one cell so that's a good way to go about
[SPEAKER_00]: targeting that we also have metabolism so
all living organisms use energy consume
[SPEAKER_00]: and use energy in addition the
all-important homeostasis so here we see
[SPEAKER_00]: some guy in a tightrope bouncing out all
living organisms must maintain stable
[SPEAKER_00]: internal conditions despite the changing
external conditions that they may be
[SPEAKER_00]: facing so they can stay on that tightrope
of life in addition we have this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: blooming and growing flower here and this
is important for growth and reproduction
[SPEAKER_00]: all living organisms must grow and
reproduce and see the flowers not only
[SPEAKER_00]: growing but the reproductive structures of
the plant now what those organs are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be passing on is the process of
heredity so all living organisms possess
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic material that's based on DNA
that's passed on to the next generation
[SPEAKER_00]: moving along to the organization of life
so if we have life we need to have it
[SPEAKER_00]: organized and how do we go about
organizing that well when we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: life here we have a small little ladybug
we can look at the atomic level the
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule level and we can zoom out to the
earth here and even beyond and this goes
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty far into kind of the galaxy base
but you get the idea of how we can start
[SPEAKER_00]: with something very small the rest is very
large when you walk in the woods well what
[SPEAKER_00]: do you see when you walk in the woods you
see kind of all these things kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: coming together see how the water and the
trees in the animals all interact here we
[SPEAKER_00]: have a single neuron that cannot perform
the tasks of the brain we have something
[SPEAKER_00]: called an emergent property we're higher
level organization that contains novel
[SPEAKER_00]: properties not found in the simpler level
here we see neurons working together as
[SPEAKER_00]: the functional brain that no single neuron
can perform on its own applying the same
[SPEAKER_00]: concept to these geese in the field here
well we know what emergent property is
[SPEAKER_00]: what emergent property can these geese
provide addition they tend to work
[SPEAKER_00]: together for looking for food that's one
thing but really if you see him in the
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly the spring in the fall flying
efficiency when they form that nice V in
[SPEAKER_00]: addition we have five themes that unify
biology here and these first one would be
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution the gene frequencies change in a
species over time this is over a long
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time in addition another theme
that kind of ties in biology is the flow
[SPEAKER_00]: of energy here we see plants capturing the
Sun's energy capturing that light energy
[SPEAKER_00]: and forming carbohydrates now we see that
flow of energy so those plants are being
[SPEAKER_00]: fed on by insects you ever see an insect
chewing on a leaf gaining that energy that
[SPEAKER_00]: was once captured by the plant and then
here we see the poor insect being fed on
[SPEAKER_00]: by another insect so it's kind of that
circle of life that we kind of go through
[SPEAKER_00]: now in addition we also have interaction
that will occur this interaction between
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms here the plant and the insect
and we also structure determines functions
[SPEAKER_00]: with the knife and the fork the structure
needs to be well suited to fit the
[SPEAKER_00]: function the knife and the fork are a
great example of that and lastly of course
[SPEAKER_00]: we have homeostasis living organs act to
maintain a relatively stable internal
[SPEAKER_00]: environment despite the changes that occur
around them so that again they can stay on
[SPEAKER_00]: that tightrope of life you you
