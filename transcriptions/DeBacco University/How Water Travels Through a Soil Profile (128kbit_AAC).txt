[SPEAKER_00]: Ever wonder just how water travels through
a soil profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here on Tobacco University, we're going to
see some cutaways of some soil profiles
[SPEAKER_00]: and see just how water travels through a
soil profile, giving some varying
[SPEAKER_00]: different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into how water
travels through a soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, special thanks to this
video here that is provided as information
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is the video where I captured
many of the screenshots that we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to see here presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to look at the original,
by all means look at the reference below
[SPEAKER_00]: and look at the direct link there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting into how water travels through
the soil profile, keep in mind that water
[SPEAKER_00]: does travel in a unique way through soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That depends on the composition of that
soil and also the potential layers of
[SPEAKER_00]: different soil types that may exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see this in a couple
examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, looking at the soil profile in
general, a lot of times soil scientists
[SPEAKER_00]: will be referred to horizons, the O
horizon, meaning the organic or very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very top layer here, the A, which is the
surface layer, B, subsoil, C, we're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting down into that deeper areas,
typically where roots do not travel,
[SPEAKER_00]: and R down here, which is the bedrock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why understanding the type of
soil that a grower has is important as it
[SPEAKER_00]: will influence how water moves through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also due to different soil types,
this is why what may work for one grower
[SPEAKER_00]: may not necessarily work for another when
it comes to irrigation frequency,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind, a lot of it has to
do with just how water travels,
[SPEAKER_00]: which a lot of growers really don't
necessarily understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we want to consider
capillary action.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what just is capillary action?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, kind of it's shown here in this kind
of example that we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capillary action basically is the ability
for a liquid to flow in narrow spaces
[SPEAKER_00]: without the assistance of, or even in
opposition to external forces such as
[SPEAKER_00]: gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It occurs because of the intermolecular
forces between the liquid and surrounding
[SPEAKER_00]: solid surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're looking at here is we see
kind of a, see a glove, we see kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: clear piece of glass, and we see this kind
of blue liquid here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's happening is down at the
bottom, there is a blue liquid,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's actually two pieces of glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the person is doing here is
they're pinching those two pieces of glass
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they make those two pieces of glass
tighter, as they're going through and
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing those closer, they're reducing the
space, and that creating a very small
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see pushing here, causing that water
to flow against gravity, pushing even
[SPEAKER_00]: tighter, making that space even smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: There allows that water to travel even
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the space is sufficiently small,
then the combination of surface tension
[SPEAKER_00]: caused by the cohesive properties of the
liquid, in this case looking at water,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as adhesive forces between the liquid
and the container wall act to propel the
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid, and that's exactly what we see
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That space gets smaller and smaller,
crushing that together, increasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: height that that water can travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this smaller space allows the
water to move further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're seeing here in these
images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we also have the path of water in
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at just a sandy loam,
a loam, and a clay loam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically we have large particles,
medium-sized particles, and smaller-sized
[SPEAKER_00]: particles, at least in a relative
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sandy loams will drain very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medium-sized loam is kind of that
medium-fast drainage, and then clay loam
[SPEAKER_00]: will do the slower drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're looking at is those
cutaways of those profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we're seeing here is we see
little droppers, and we're basically
[SPEAKER_00]: simulating a rain event, or maybe a drip
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would go through in-drip water at
a very consistent rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're noticing is that the sandy
loam over the standard set of time here,
[SPEAKER_00]: fully saturates by the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The loam we see that slower, and of course
the clay loam much more slower to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: have that water percolate through.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's something we're also noticing in
this example, as well as others,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that water does not travel in a
straight line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water will actually slowly kind of cone
outwards from the original point where it
[SPEAKER_00]: hits and comes in contact with that
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why when we're looking at drip
irrigation, we can have those drip
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation lines spaced further apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though the very surface may
appear dry, what happens is the coning
[SPEAKER_00]: effect here of the water saturates the
area or the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very important concept that a lot
of growers forget about or don't fully
[SPEAKER_00]: understand, is that we're seeing this
coning effect of that water kind of cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: here, cuts here, starts here, and starts
coning out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how we're able to saturate
these root area, the root zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the irrigation water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we don't need irrigation lines
right next to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be spaced out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that distance will depend on the exact
soil type, because that's going to affect
[SPEAKER_00]: the degree that that cone will go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here we're looking at an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're starting basically right where I
am.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a deep sand layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does that impact?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, we have loam.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a sand layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have loam again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So same soil type with a sand barrier and
then loam.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're noticing is we're seeing that
same coning effect here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing that soil starting to kind of
go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it's just coming initially in contact
with that sand layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we notice with that sand layer is
that it actually is a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It prevents that water really from
percolating through as it normally would.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing here spread out as well as
here again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're seeing it definitely
continue to spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But between the two images between me,
we're starting to see a little bit of that
[SPEAKER_00]: saturation penetrate that sand layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, once it does penetrate that sand
layer, as we see the two images around me
[SPEAKER_00]: now, we are seeing the same coning effect
relocating below that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind that here, that top layer
is fully saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that spreading out from that
single point of entry, spreading out this
[SPEAKER_00]: full area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it kind of breaks its way through in
that center point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're seeing the coning effect
repeat itself again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important to understand how
with the soil type you have this at the
[SPEAKER_00]: top.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's a different layer there,
if there's a barrier there, if there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: different type that occurs, that can
really impact the way that this water
[SPEAKER_00]: percolates through the profile of the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now lastly, in many fields they have to
deal with what's called a hard pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is considered the clay layers we see
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have loam again and loam again.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case instead of sand, now we have
a clay layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider this to be like a hard pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is commonly found in tilled or plowed
fields where you have that equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly going over that certain depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that bottom where that scraping
occurs, we kind of get a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: that hard layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing again, everything starts
out very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that loam, as we would expect it,
water's coning out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have water kind of coning out
to the point that it then comes in contact
[SPEAKER_00]: with that clay or plow plan layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike with the sand layer, while we do
see that the water is coming in contact
[SPEAKER_00]: and spreading outwards, just as we saw
with the sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, even after a period of time,
we really do not see the water penetrating
[SPEAKER_00]: or percolating through that clay layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on a quick look of the profile of the
soil, while this hard pan or clay layer
[SPEAKER_00]: looks very similar to this previous one we
looked at with the sand, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: properties of sand are very different,
the water is eventually able to percolate
[SPEAKER_00]: through after a period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, looking at a hard pan,
plow plan layer or the dense clay layer
[SPEAKER_00]: here, as thin as it may be, in this
example the water is unable to penetrate
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to create a pretty
substantial dry pocket down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this allows you to better
understand exactly how water percolates
[SPEAKER_00]: through soil, regardless of the type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important also to look at your
soil profile to see if any of these
[SPEAKER_00]: layers, though they may be thin,
exist, because that is going to impact how
[SPEAKER_00]: water travels through your soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be very important for spacing out
drip irrigation lines, understanding the
[SPEAKER_00]: coning properties of the water is very
important to ensure you're delivering
[SPEAKER_00]: water to the root zone that you want
without over irrigating or under
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't run the risk of disease or
wasting water.
Thank you very much for watching.
