[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at some of the
regions of the human brain and also go
[SPEAKER_00]: over some of the very important functions
that these different regions are
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the brain in general,
it's a mass of about 100 billion neurons
[SPEAKER_00]: located inside the skull.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully your brain is a little bit
bigger than Homer Simpson's brain does
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where learning occurs and this
happens when more and stronger connections
[SPEAKER_00]: are made between neurons that are located
in your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have heard of left brain and right
brain people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Left brain typically referring to those
good with logic and math.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right brain referring to those that are
creative and associated with the arts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may have some truth behind it,
but there's a lot of interconnections that
[SPEAKER_00]: occur between both your left and right
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, your telicephalon is a
region of the brain that's devoted largely
[SPEAKER_00]: to associative activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cerebrum or cerebrum is about 85% of
the weight of the human brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's located here in red and highlighted
so you can have an idea of just how large
[SPEAKER_00]: it is and also where it's located.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the dominant part of the brain and
receives sensory data and issues motor
[SPEAKER_00]: commands.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cerebral cortex, the gray outer layer,
hidden in this region, functions in
[SPEAKER_00]: language, thought, personality,
and other thinking and feeling activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cerebrum is also the largest part of
the human brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now while it may be divided in different
regions as we see here, such as the
[SPEAKER_00]: frontal lobe, the temporal lobe,
the parental lobe, and the occipital lobe,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these together make up the cerebrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cerebrum and all these different
lobes are responsible for thought,
[SPEAKER_00]: language, senses, memory, and voluntary
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, we have the cerebellum and
this is at the base of the brain located
[SPEAKER_00]: in red here.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it may be a little bit smaller in
nature than the cerebrum we just talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about, it is responsible for muscle
coordination, balance, and posture,
[SPEAKER_00]: all things that are very vital to our
day-to-day lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cross-section of how it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a lot of folds located in this
region and sometimes you may have heard or
[SPEAKER_00]: hear it referred to as the hindbrain but
we'll refer to it as the cerebellum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, we have the brainstem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This connects the brain to the spinal
cord, which sounds pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brainstem connects brain to spinal
cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the brainstem itself also has
some very important responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, highlighted here in red,
this region is responsible for monitoring
[SPEAKER_00]: and keeping us breathing, our swallowing,
our digestion, our heartbeat, and also
[SPEAKER_00]: monitoring and maintaining a healthy blood
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, we have the dianus cephalon
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is composed of the thalamus,
which is the relay center between incoming
[SPEAKER_00]: sensory information and the cerebrum,
and the hypothalamus, which coordinates
[SPEAKER_00]: nervous and hormonal responses to many
internal stimuli, such as body temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: and blood pressure, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, emotions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It controls the pituitary gland and its
secretions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here's our thalamus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our hypothalamus, located here,
and it's in direct relation to the
[SPEAKER_00]: pituitary gland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a right thalamus and a left
thalamus and a hypothalamus.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these different regions here are
performing very important functions to
[SPEAKER_00]: help us maintain homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it's located just about in that
center portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the skull here rotates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that red referring to where the
thalamus is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see where the thalamus is at high
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hypothalamus is located right in the
frontal region there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you the anatomy of the brain,
there's the cerebrum, there's the
[SPEAKER_00]: cerebellum, and there's our brain stem.
