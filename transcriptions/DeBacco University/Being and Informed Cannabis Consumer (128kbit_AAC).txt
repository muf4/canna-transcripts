[SPEAKER_00]: While there may be many consumers of
cannabis here at Tobacco University,
[SPEAKER_00]: the goal is to make you an informed
cannabis consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in this video lecture,
we're going to go over just that to allow
[SPEAKER_00]: you to be an informed consumer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go through the steps you
need to being an informed cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, if not provided,
request it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that referring to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if they're not provided with the
information, you need to be sure you're
[SPEAKER_00]: requesting the information that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to ask for results from the
original analytical report or the original
[SPEAKER_00]: certificate of analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is when you're looking at
purchasing cannabis, it's great to see a
[SPEAKER_00]: label, but we want to also be getting and
requesting, if it's not provided to us,
[SPEAKER_00]: that analytical report.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the analytical report kind of
tell us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it is going to tell us potential THC
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the main cannabinoid
associated with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers are looking for the high
highest levels possible while others are
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned about the THC levels in their
plants to maintain federal compliance to
[SPEAKER_00]: be classified as hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of growers are concerned with
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that necessarily just the most THC
possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the other cannabinoid of great
interest is usually CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this cannabinoid is also focused with
many growers, with many looking for high
[SPEAKER_00]: levels for medical benefits and also to
maintain classification as hemp while
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping their THC level below 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what classifies it as marijuana or hemp
would be that THC level above or below
[SPEAKER_00]: that 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, for the true medical benefits,
a lot of growers are looking at breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: as high of a CBD percentage as possible
while still keeping that THC level below
[SPEAKER_00]: that federal limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into organic certified
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we see a lot of organic
certification with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're looking for certified
organic cannabis, pretty much you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic approaches can be used,
but certifying a crop as organic requires
[SPEAKER_00]: federal standards and these are not
written for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, organic growing practices,
organic, yes it's possible, but not
[SPEAKER_00]: certified organic at a federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get into indoor or outdoor
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one should I be looking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one is quote unquote better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Many consumers consider the indoor grown
cannabis to be of higher quality than
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor production typically yields a
better looking flower and one with higher
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids compared to outdoor
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your indoor production with your
controlled environment, your artificial
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, your good air circulation can
really produce a high quality product
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the outdoor grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is because of the degree of
those environmental controls an indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grower has compared to the outdoor
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this does not mean one is better
than the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to look at the analytical
report provided and determine the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cannabis flower based on that,
not necessarily the indoor or outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: growing nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the analytical report say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind your outdoor growing will
have more variability, a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: inconsistencies, may not look quite as
perfect as an indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a factor of the environment,
but really we should be looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: report of the cannabinoids of the terpenes
to really determine the quality of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, not necessarily the environment
that it was produced in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that brings us to that proper testing
and that importance of the proper testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these analytical reports are very
important for cannabis dry flower as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a grower standpoint, it allows for a
certification of your final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're a consumer standpoint,
it allows for the knowledge of the product
[SPEAKER_00]: to be purchased is clean of potential
contaminants with what is actually in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say clean, we're referring to the
example of passing, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pesticide test, the heavy metal test,
things of that nature, aflatoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure we're having a pure
product, a clean product, that we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have any contaminants that are
going to be ingested in the consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we want to request lab results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's part of making you an informed
consumer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're not provided with the
information to be informed, you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: then seek that information out yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing is required by cannabis dry flower
as well as other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if not directly provided to you,
you can and you should be requesting for
[SPEAKER_00]: that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: A product label is a good start,
as we can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great start, but you really want
the original analytical report.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that label is great for comparison,
looking at one versus another and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: doing comparison that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why you want that original
analytical report is it's going to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you some more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers should be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're comparing your numbers here to
your numbers on the label, they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why go through the trouble of asking
for this in a local report?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you want to have such details as the
report date, the date it was collected,
[SPEAKER_00]: the lab ID, the product description,
and the lab name.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these will help ensure the test
results match the lot for the product
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking to purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indistant dates or inconsistencies are red
flags that should result in caution before
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing or using that particular
cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see everything match up that
you can, but then you want to see those
[SPEAKER_00]: additional details.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when in doubt, you can always contact
the lab to see if they can confirm the
[SPEAKER_00]: batch number, the date received,
the test results, the company they were
[SPEAKER_00]: testing for, because that all just gives
you more information to be informed that
[SPEAKER_00]: the product you're purchasing is actually
supported by this documentation and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can ensure a safe product and therefore
you'll be an informed and well
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledgeable consumer.
