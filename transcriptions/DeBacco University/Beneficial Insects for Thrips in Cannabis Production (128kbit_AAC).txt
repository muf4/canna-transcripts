[SPEAKER_00]: All right, in this DeBaco University
video, we're going to look at beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: insects regarding thrips in your cannabis
production there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thrips can be a common pest that's
identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you an example of what they
look like, as well as the damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this video will give you an idea of
the beneficial insects you can use to help
[SPEAKER_00]: control these pesky insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the video here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, this is based off a research
article so you're welcome to follow this
[SPEAKER_00]: reference and citation for more details
into the materials and methods utilized as
[SPEAKER_00]: part of this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, insects can be a challenge
in general for greenhouse production and
[SPEAKER_00]: these can cause many losses economically,
environmentally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, typically, the reason why we're
talking about beneficial insects in this
[SPEAKER_00]: video is synthetic chemicals have been the
go-to option.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's many restrictions using these
forms of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the driving force to development
of new, environmentally friendly,
[SPEAKER_00]: and profitable pest methods for pest
control, which will be discussed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, this was a greenhouse study
conducted at the Agricultural University
[SPEAKER_00]: of Athens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had plants grown in two different
greenhouses, both one with treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: which had the beneficial insects,
and one that did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cultivar used was this Manouche
variety and this gives you an idea of the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse's environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the release date for the beneficial
insects was three weeks after
[SPEAKER_00]: transplantation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beneficial insects were released into
the treatment greenhouse in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: assess the efficiency of the biological
pest method of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thrips were the study here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of gives you exactly an image of
what to look like on a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going to be the main one
talked about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the study looked at others,
but this will be the main one talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, basic measures for
management included visual estimation of
[SPEAKER_00]: infestation and recruiting of pest species
and populations and the comparison of
[SPEAKER_00]: infestations between the two greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the nymphs and adult stages of pests
were counted, not the egg stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had an idea what other insects they
looked at or what these insects look like
[SPEAKER_00]: in comparison, this nice little visual
kind of key identification here might be
[SPEAKER_00]: of help to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how were these pest populations
determined?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was the measurements of the pest
populations were taken in the third,
[SPEAKER_00]: fifth, seventh, and ninth week.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of pests in this case thrips
was counted with a handheld digital 1600x
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope in order to quantify the
efficiency of the beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average pest populations were measured
in 10 plants, four leaves per plant per
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with any pest that we're trying to deal
with, understanding the life cycle is
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I welcome you to pause the video here
to take a better look at exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips are, what their life cycle is,
and how you would go about identifying
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I want you to keep in mind that
thrips can also transmit viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only can they do physical damage to
your plants, but they can also provide a
[SPEAKER_00]: vector for other negative impacts to your
plants, in this case, viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So controlling the thrips will reduce the
physical damage as well as the chance at
[SPEAKER_00]: virus vectoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their life cycle, they can go through a
series of six stages in only about two to
[SPEAKER_00]: three and a half weeks at 68 to 85 degrees
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: With insects realized at temperature,
you should be monitoring that and
[SPEAKER_00]: recording that because that can impact the
rate of development of certain insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for identification, the adults are
very small, very slender as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they can have different colorations,
so keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larvae are actually wingless,
so they're not going to travel very far,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they tend to like very hidden portions
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the beneficial insects here,
first one that was discussed is Ambilis
[SPEAKER_00]: saurski.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a predatory mite that pierces the
prey with their sucking mouthparts and
[SPEAKER_00]: sucks out the contents there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, some more information about
that specific one here, and some tips and
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas you're welcome to take a look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, there's a temperature tolerance
range, so again, we don't want to go above
[SPEAKER_00]: or below that to allow for the maximum
effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the other one shown here is Arias,
and it's kind of a cool kind of picture
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its life cycle is completed in about three
weeks, and it has this very darkening and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of blackened back, which is how I
speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fast-moving predator of small,
soft-bodied insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also feed on pollen in the absence
of prey, so you could potentially sustain
[SPEAKER_00]: this population within your greenhouse if
you're growing some flowering plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: have some pollen to keep their populations
going and help them keep going so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: help you with THRIP control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the exact method of THRIP control,
how do we apply these insects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they can be used with slow-release
sachets that we kind of see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each contained about 250 predatory mites
of the Swirsky one, and then of the Arias
[SPEAKER_00]: one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was applied by spreading evenly
through bottles measured in the leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: also using dye boxes, which are basically
little boxes that would hang on your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the numbers over time, because this
was a study, so I wanted to provide you
[SPEAKER_00]: with the actual numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right above me here, you can see the
table, and then here's the graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: On week nine, it was low as only about 2.6
THRIPS per plant with the treated,
[SPEAKER_00]: those plants treated with beneficial
insects, compared to over 40 THRIPS in
[SPEAKER_00]: control plants that, of course,
were not treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see the great contrast here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both start around the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The control, definitely much higher and
significantly higher as well, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: treated slowly decreasing over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great sign that these beneficial insects
were helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now average number of pest populations,
again, this was measured in weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this study was conducted on other
populations, so you're welcome to check
[SPEAKER_00]: that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this continuous reduction in all pest
populations was observed through the
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment approaching zero plant values
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great sign that these might be
very effective in use in your growing
[SPEAKER_00]: operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now again, are they worth it, the
beneficial insects in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in short, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Study results that the beneficial insects
could control pest populations up to 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pest management with natural enemies is
promising, very effective, safe method for
[SPEAKER_00]: plant protection, as well as applicator
protection as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you are thinking about this,
and hopefully you are, keep in mind that
[SPEAKER_00]: proper pest identification is important,
since this will determine the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insect used, and this does
require frequent scouting, which you
[SPEAKER_00]: should be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timing and rate of beneficial additions
are important, and when you get down to
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing exactly what insect, researching
those, contacting the supplier of the
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects, they can all help you
develop a plan that will be effective at
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling your pest populations while
minimizing any chance of negative overall
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental impacts.
Thank you.
