[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to look at the
adaptive or sometimes called the acquired
[SPEAKER_00]: immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a very precise sequence of steps
that goes on and the key part here is we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to have the immune system remembering
and recognizing and acting in a very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific manner through this process or
branch of the immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember the innate immune system
is the other one that you're born with and
[SPEAKER_00]: can be thought of as the other branch of
the immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking specifically at the acquired
immune system we may have seen this image
[SPEAKER_00]: before relating to a hormone binding and
having a response that occurs but a very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar process that goes with the
acquired immune system or again the
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptive immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first part we need to have a very
specific recognition of the foreign
[SPEAKER_00]: substances that occurs through the
proteins on the cell surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: This acts to immobilize, neutralize,
or destroy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we want to amplify the inflammatory
response and activate a complement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's happening is once we have that
binding occurring we want to destroy that
[SPEAKER_00]: specific foreign invader but we want to
activate a bunch of other cellular
[SPEAKER_00]: responses to help increase the body's
response to this foreign invader.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps the entire body maintain high
health because once one becomes infected
[SPEAKER_00]: the body's immune system is alerted and
then it's going to be spread throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the acquired immune system technically
has three main components to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is an antigen specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our antigens.
[SPEAKER_00]: These antigens are a molecule that
provokes a specific immune response
[SPEAKER_00]: specific to an antibody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the antigen is a specific molecule that
is initiating this immune response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in acquired immune system this is a
systemic process which means it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: restricted by any region in the body and
this is an example of a plant but we
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about systemic insecticides or
systemic products that can go through the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same concept applies to the human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not restricted by anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can travel within the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third component to the acquired or
adaptive immune system is the fact that it
[SPEAKER_00]: has memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes educated cells that remain
after the invader is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It remembers and is able to recognize
certain pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: In acquired immune system it's two
separate overlapping arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: One are B cells and they're called the
humoral immunity for body fluid and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're thought of eye attack invaders
outside the cells and then T cells which
[SPEAKER_00]: is called cellular immunity and eye attack
infected cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again two different components both
performing under the same immune system
[SPEAKER_00]: but have different and separate
overlapping arms there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the most complex and slowest to
respond to our acquired immune system
[SPEAKER_00]: because it has to activate cells for each
new invader.
[SPEAKER_00]: On first exposure it takes about 10 days
to reach peak levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is more of a long term effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an immediate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a little bit of a delay in this
recognition process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Antigens is a macromolecule that reacts
with a component of the immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example of an antigen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The figure above here shows the entire
structure of an antigen and the different
[SPEAKER_00]: structures here projecting from the
different shapes and they're over
[SPEAKER_00]: exaggerated in this image represent
potential epitopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a given antigen may contain several
motifs which are recognized by immune
[SPEAKER_00]: cells and each motif has an epitope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again a little over exaggeration with
different colors and shapes but the key
[SPEAKER_00]: part as we learn with proteins is shape is
very important for recognition and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing that also that theme need continue
with the immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the antigen binding site is different
in T and B cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a T cell receptor spans the membrane
and projects variable binding regions into
[SPEAKER_00]: the extracellular space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Binds the processed antigens via MHC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our B cells look very different on
just a quick comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has a branched appearance and
this one has a single appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where B cell receptors are embedded in the
membranes of the B cells and bind to their
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of antigens through their variable
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The signal transduction region transfers
the signal into the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see this one goes completely
through and has an intercellular domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one does not.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one does have the branched variable
regions and this one has a single variable
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both have antigen binding sites here
and here but the T cells only have one,
[SPEAKER_00]: the B cells have two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of B's having two bumps and T's
having one line to help you remember
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: B cells are catching the veils in body
fluids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they do is they originate in the
bone marrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So B cells, to help you remember the name
you can think of B standing for where they
[SPEAKER_00]: mature is in bone marrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember our bone marrow is producing our
red, white, and blood cells and also our
[SPEAKER_00]: platelets interacting with that lymphatic
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those B cells originate and they mature
in that bone marrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again B cells you can think of bone
marrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They circulate in the blood and the lymph
and they are responsible for catching
[SPEAKER_00]: invaders in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our B cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see through binding receptors here with
our helper T cell which we'll go over in
[SPEAKER_00]: another lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're noticing we're producing memory B
cells for the longer term and then plasma
[SPEAKER_00]: cells here with antibodies streamed about.
[SPEAKER_00]: B cells are important for recognition so
they want to see identification and this
[SPEAKER_00]: is why the MHC is part of the receptor
used for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they peripherally, plasma cells produce
antibodies you see here and our memory
[SPEAKER_00]: cells provide quick response on
re-exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while initially it might be a slow
process upon re-exposure is where that
[SPEAKER_00]: quicker response is occurring in the
memory cells so they're holding on for the
[SPEAKER_00]: long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly our T cells are destroying infected
cells and they are present and mature in
[SPEAKER_00]: the thalamus here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a way to help you remember that is they
originate in the bone marrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they mature in the thalamus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So T cells, thalamus, T and T connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: They develop the ability to identify
foreign agents by antigens presented on
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see our antigen presenting complex
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our recognition site.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our T cells being involved in
destroying infected cells which are very
[SPEAKER_00]: important to the proper functioning of the
immune system.
