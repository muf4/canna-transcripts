[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you hate when you get a fingerprint
on the screen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hopefully this video will make you
appreciate, or at least take a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: look harder at what's on the screen before
you go through and you wipe it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to focus on fingerprints,
but same applies to palm prints and
[SPEAKER_00]: footprints.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dermal papillae lie atop the dermal
ridges, and that's what we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: when we look at a natural fingerprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're elevated, overlying the epidermis
into dermal ridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are sweat films because of sweat
pores, and they're actually genetically
[SPEAKER_00]: determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to be looking at a couple
of the key different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three main classifications,
arches, loops, and whorls.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be able to identify these in greater
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for those thinking about getting a
tattoo, since we're talking about skin,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dermis is the receptive site for the
pigment of tattoos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit lower or deeper down,
we're focusing a little bit more on how
[SPEAKER_00]: this dermal layer impacts the shape or the
ridges that occur on the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with fingerprints,
some of the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: No two people have been found with the
exact same fingerprint pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fingerprint pattern will remain
unchanged for the life of the individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the print itself may change due
to permanent scars or skin diseases or
[SPEAKER_00]: damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here a little bit of a pie
graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: 55% typically have loops, 23 whorls,
12% arches, and 10% composites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to investigate each one of
these in a little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to go back, if you're interested in
learning more about fingerprints,
[SPEAKER_00]: I included a couple of resources down here
and some slideshows to take a look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So continuing on, the three major
fingerprint classes are arches,
[SPEAKER_00]: loops, and whorls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each group is divided into smaller groups
as seen in the list below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within arches, we have what's called a
plane arch, a tinted arch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loops, we have something called a radial
and an ulnar loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whorls, we have different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to show you some examples of
these so you can be able to identify what
[SPEAKER_00]: your own fingerprints are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the most basic one,
the arches.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the St. Louis Gateway arch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arches are the simplest type of
fingerprints, and they're formed by ridges
[SPEAKER_00]: on either side of the print and exit the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here, a plane arch, just kind of a
little bit of a rise here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ridges enter one side and exit the other
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tinted arch is similar to a plane arch,
but it has a spike in the center,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit more pronounced here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both of these are arches.
[SPEAKER_00]: These would be considered plane arches.
[SPEAKER_00]: These would be tinted arches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loops is where it gets a little more
confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loops must have one delta and one or more
ridges that enter or leave the same side.
[SPEAKER_00]: These patterns are named for the position
related to the radius in the ulnar bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bone the loop is opening is facing
towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bone the loop opening is facing
towards is the bone that gets the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get some examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our left hand, we have our
right hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to remember that wherever
your thumb is, this portion here,
[SPEAKER_00]: this bone, is the radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other side here is the ulna.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same goes for left and right hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here's the thumb, and here's
the radius, the thicker bone, and the ulna
[SPEAKER_00]: is the thinner bone here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we have a print here, a loop made,
the openings are pointing this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if this was made with a left hand,
we're on this end and the loops are
[SPEAKER_00]: pointing this way, we point them towards
the radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a radial loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if this same print was made with the
left hand, it would be pointing this way
[SPEAKER_00]: and be pointing actually to the ulna.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ulnar loop would be the proper term
for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same thing goes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this was made with the left hand,
it would be pointing to the ulnar loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was made with the right hand,
it would be pointing to the radial loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The delta that's mentioned are these small
regions here from a little delta,
[SPEAKER_00]: little triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that evident right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with loops, it's very important to
realize or identify if it was made with
[SPEAKER_00]: the left hand or if it was made with the
right hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on to whorls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whorls have at least one ridge that
makes or tends to make a complete circuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have at least two deltas.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a print has more than two deltas,
it's likely accidental.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here, we see our whorl.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plane whorl, we have a center pocket
whorl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're doing is we're drawing a
line here between the two deltas in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plane and central pocket whorls.
[SPEAKER_00]: If some of the curvature just touched the
line, as you see here, it's considered a
[SPEAKER_00]: plane whorl.
[SPEAKER_00]: If none of them touch the center line,
we would call a central pocket whorl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's just getting a little bit more
deeper into the classification of whorls.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's both a plane and a central pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whorls part two are actually composites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have something called a double loop
whorl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our delta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another delta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double loop whorls are comprised of two
loops combined into one print.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's called a double loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mention the composite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a picture here of a dog and kind
of a bird, kind of a mermaid.
[SPEAKER_00]: A merger of two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we see kind of here with an
accidental whorl sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains two or more patterns,
and not including the plane arch,
[SPEAKER_00]: or does not clearly fall under any of the
other categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of somewhat considered the
miscellaneous categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accidental whorl, this composite,
it's kind of a combination of a few
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So identify each fingerprint pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you'll notice with each fingerprint,
A, B, C, D, and E, I also include what
[SPEAKER_00]: hand it was made of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very important if we're looking at
identifying, if we look back, we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure if we're identifying something
as a loop, we're identifying the left or
[SPEAKER_00]: the right hand as an ulnar or a radial
loop based on what direction the openings
[SPEAKER_00]: are pointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's going back to the very beginning,
if it's an arch, it doesn't matter left or
[SPEAKER_00]: right hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loops, it does make a difference,
and whorls, it does not make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get a chance to just take a look
at this, you can pause the video at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point and see if you can identify these
various fingerprints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, hopefully you've paused the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to reveal the answers to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you've gone through and been
able to write down some of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are the answers to the various
fingerprints here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this is helpful, identifying
fingerprints here on the slides that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have, and also makes you look at your
fingers that you're very familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: working with a little bit better and
develop a better understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: of your own body.
Thank you.
Thank you.
