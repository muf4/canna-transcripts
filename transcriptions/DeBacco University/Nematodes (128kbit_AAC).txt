[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're looking at nematodes,
or nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, both pronunciations are
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are non-segmented worms, meaning that
these are, in fact, animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, while they are very small,
these are animals that can infect plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they're often overlooked,
and they can infect the roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the leaves of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most commonly found in the soil can
feed on the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably what they're most notable
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root, not nematode, being one that's often
talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can, there are some that can
infect the leaves, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the identification, see here,
these small worm-like structures,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are very simple organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most are small, but can be a wide range,
from 0.3 millimeters to up to 8 meters
[SPEAKER_00]: long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, keep in mind that size isn't
necessarily a way to positively identify
[SPEAKER_00]: these, because the range is so wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are non-segmented worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, these are animals we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only about 20,000 species,
with some actually being beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, once you think that all nematodes are
negative impacts on plants, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually some beneficial ones,
and they can be used to help control other
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, white gropes in lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, where to look for these?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're typically found in soils and can
infect the roots, so that's usually the
[SPEAKER_00]: first area people look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: A microscope is often needed for positive
identification, due to the fact that they
[SPEAKER_00]: are so small, for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they are, so they may get quite
large.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many of the parasitic ones,
the ones that feed on the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: are on the smaller end of that scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also have a delayed, almost a
three-week delay, in fact, on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when we finally start to see some
negative effects, well, that initial
[SPEAKER_00]: infection could have occurred up to three
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, in part, why keeping records
and documentation is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, management is a challenge,
so sanitation is highly recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vestations can be reduced by following
soil for outdoor operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: In media solarization, what this
solarization refers to is we're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: covering the area in this clear plastic,
heating this soil up to extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures, causing the nematodes here,
which are, again, animals, to die,
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that these will reduce the
nematodes mainly only in the upper 6 to 12
[SPEAKER_00]: inches of soil, and do not provide a
long-term solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is good for areas where you may
have increased pressure, may want to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and do this once, pull the plastic
up, or take the media out, kind of remix
[SPEAKER_00]: it, and do it again to ensure you're
getting an even kill throughout the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: profile there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, those will be killing the very
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are living below that where your
roots tend to go, you'll just simply have
[SPEAKER_00]: infection occur again.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to control them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because these are animals,
the products you usually use to control
[SPEAKER_00]: them are harmful to humans, and many,
as a result, are restricted to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires a license to be able to use
them, and there are strict protocols
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fumigants target the soil and need to be
applied, and are then covered and sealed
[SPEAKER_00]: to allow liquid vapors to infiltrate the
soil particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, pretty harsh environment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in our previous slide, just to go
back for one moment, we're seeing this is
[SPEAKER_00]: simply covering this and causing the heat
of the sun to kind of surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilize, and solarize the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're covering the soil,
but also adding a fumigant, a pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in outdoor operation,
rotating broccoli, cauliflower,
[SPEAKER_00]: grain sorghum, or millet, can lower root
knot nematodes if that's your particular
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind that it's recommended
these are grown for two consecutive
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this isn't grow broccoli for one year,
and then go back and plant it,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at maybe growing broccoli,
then cauliflower, and then back to your
[SPEAKER_00]: host crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes this isn't an option for some
growers, but if it is, this can be a way
[SPEAKER_00]: to help try to reduce those numbers
biologically without adding any pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: or fumigants to the soil, because again,
these are animals and they can,
[SPEAKER_00]: those pesticides typically have a lot of
harmful effects to humans in the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives you a little bit of that
brief overview of nematodes, and hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: gets to understand a little bit more about
these animals and how they can impact
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, but also the fact that they can be
beneficial in some regards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
