[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at a
cannabis mother room, which is where the
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plants or stock plants are kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to put these pictures here to kind of,
if you've been to like a county fair,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a birthing center, you can see the
mother producing many offspring here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see all the nice little piglets.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of like all the nice little
clones that ideally that one mother or
[SPEAKER_00]: stock plant will produce to go on into the
other stages of growth and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the basics of a mother room,
this is again where the stock plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: kept, and you want to consider putting
plants in larger containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically this means seven gallon or
greater, seven to ten is typically what
[SPEAKER_00]: most people will keep their mother plants
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows them to be grown for the full
year, that's a full calendar year,
[SPEAKER_00]: without becoming really highly pot bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often this mother room or stock room,
while it may contain many plants or it
[SPEAKER_00]: could be a mix of genetics, this is often
off limits to visitors because it contains
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially rare and unique genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind you're restricting that area
because if you have that mother plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a reason why that's a mother
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it has a unique genetic set or it's a
unique cross or something different than
[SPEAKER_00]: the vast majority of plants that you may
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting of a mother room, plants will be
in here, will be in the vegetative state
[SPEAKER_00]: so they can get 16 hours plus of
continuous light is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluorescence will not produce enough
penetrating light so they shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_00]: used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ceramic metal halides or metal halides are
a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a ceramic metal halide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also be used for propagation
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again you can be using the same light
potentially for multiple purposes or at
[SPEAKER_00]: least the same fixture that you could be
running slightly different ways and
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing your amount of just difference
that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's streamlining the process a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Health and feeding of a mother plant,
remember plants will be full size and
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially older so keeping them in good
health is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can easily become stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilizing is often required but watch
the amount of nitrogen you add as this
[SPEAKER_00]: will reduce the ease of rooting those
cuttings in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can inspect the roots, you can see
here nice dense root system, good
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative growth, a lot of branches,
a lot of great clone opportunities here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you overfeed this with nitrogen it
will reduce the rooting of those clones so
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to be mindful of that to try to
keep everything as healthy and efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible.
