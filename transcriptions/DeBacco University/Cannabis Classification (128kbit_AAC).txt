[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another Debaco University
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be looking at cannabis
classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: These three terms you might be familiar
with, sativa, indica, and rudalis,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to define them and look at
them in a little bit more detail here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, cannabis is a genus and it's
likely to have originated in the wet
[SPEAKER_00]: habits of the Asia continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long coexistence with mankind
which led to its early domestication.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why it was domesticated is
because of its many uses and
[SPEAKER_00]: possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be the source for textile fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be utilized for its
psychoactive compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this early domestication has led to
many specializations of the plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: fall into two main categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is fiber and the other would be
chemical compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And breeding continues for increasing
diversity and specificity within these
[SPEAKER_00]: general classifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, cannabis is dioecious.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It means it produces distinctive male and
distinctive female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each plant from the point that is an
embryo is genetically either male or
[SPEAKER_00]: female.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's visually identifiable by the flowers
that it will produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some isolate cases, plants will produce
both male and female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are called hermaphrodites or Hermes.
[SPEAKER_00]: With chemical treatments, it is possible
for a female plant to produce pollen and
[SPEAKER_00]: also a male plant to actually produce
female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, just talk about no
general alterations, is a distinctive male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant or a distinctive female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others plants may produce monaceous plants
or they produce male and female flowers on
[SPEAKER_00]: the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is not like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a distinctive male or female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, vernacular, those sativas,
those indicas, those reales that we might
[SPEAKER_00]: be familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are commonly used, but however,
the use of them is actually against the
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations by 20th century botanists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, personal and cultural biases
prevailed and so did the use of these
[SPEAKER_00]: terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why they're so entrenched in the
cannabis culture even today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forming classifications of cannabis just
in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that classification is really
based more on the morphology, not the
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, morphology is a study of size,
shape, and structure, how it physically
[SPEAKER_00]: looks, maybe the phenotype, you could
think about it that way, where physiology
[SPEAKER_00]: is relating to the function of the
organism and how they respond to
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a muscle would be the morphology,
whether it's skeletal muscle or cardiac
[SPEAKER_00]: muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The physiology is how that muscle actually
contracts to give you that comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between the terms morphology and
physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: To predict potential effects, the
cannabinoids and terpenes, which are the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical profiles, should be identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't be looking at just how the
plant looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be more considered the chemical
profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each plant morphology grouping has its own
general advantages, but also has a set of
[SPEAKER_00]: drawbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking first at sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativas in general go really tall,
four to 15 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their internode spacing is about three to
six inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their leaves are long and thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages that they produce high
biomass is they're commonly grown outdoors
[SPEAKER_00]: and produce better in climate with a long,
warmer growing season to allow that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to get to its full size.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drawbacks are when grown outdoors,
it can be more susceptible to wind damage
[SPEAKER_00]: because it can get so tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can have increased time to flower and
mature compared to other options.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also a photo period dependent
strain here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the indicas, these tend to be smaller
plants, only about one to six feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their internode spacing is three inches or
less.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a wide leaf morphology These
advantages, it can be fit for indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: growing operations that have limited
ceiling height.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have shorter flowering time,
so it can allow for more plant cycles for
[SPEAKER_00]: an indoor grow and can often have quicker
flowering time than what I just talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about there with sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Performs well in colder climates with
shorter growing seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the drawbacks are the total
biomass produced may be a little bit under
[SPEAKER_00]: or reduced overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is another photo period dependent
strain here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now rudalis are the autoflowers where
things get a little bit more interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be very small plants,
only one to three foot range, tight
[SPEAKER_00]: internode spacing and frequent branching
with small wide leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages is their photo period
independent, meaning they will flower
[SPEAKER_00]: based on a set number of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not dependent on the duration of
sunlight that they're exposed to or light
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, currently there's some limited
options in this category, but where those
[SPEAKER_00]: options do exist, it can be quite
advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the drawbacks are they tend to be
smaller plants which can mean less yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce less cannabinoids and
terpenes than other options.
[SPEAKER_00]: A day lost with these plants is a greater
portion of the total life cycle because
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't make that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the photo period dependent ones,
if you're growing indoors in particular,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can change when you're going to flip
them to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are predetermined based on days old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have hybrids and many current
plants are actually hybrids due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: secretive and often unknown breeding that
has occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these general characters of these
hybrids are variable because it depends on
[SPEAKER_00]: what plants were used for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What percentage, it might be a sativa
indica 50-50 split, or is it favor one
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if it's a sativa indica hybrid
or true sativa indica hybrid, it'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advantages are the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the auto flowering plant behavior
potentially with still producing desired
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and terpenes with some
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can explain the cannabinoid and
terpene profiles produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're breeding two distinctly
different lines together, you could get
[SPEAKER_00]: the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drawback is you could also get the
worst of the both combinations that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some time to breed these and
some kind of refinement that needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: occur as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in general, the summary, kind of
indica versus sativa, kind of have some
[SPEAKER_00]: examples here, have a little resource here
that you can kind of go through and look
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at just the general morphology and
some more apt to be kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid production, some more for
fiber production, some more for seed
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these can have different
derivatives based on kind of what their
[SPEAKER_00]: known to be producing, what they produce
in greater quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take a look at that there and we
have, you know, the indicas, the afghans,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those relate to where that plant
may originate from, where that land race
[SPEAKER_00]: may originate as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the last characteristic here
of some cannabis strains looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're looking also at the origins
and aroma descriptions here, just to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you some idea of some of the diversity
that does occur within cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might look at all these quickly and
see they all look very similar,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as you start looking at them in more
detail, you see different phenotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: different morphologies develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different morphologies, they also have
those different aromas, descriptions,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, and terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind that cannabis is a
very broad category.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be looking at some of the
specifics so we can ensure that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing the best variety of strain to fit
our particular conditions or desired end
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
