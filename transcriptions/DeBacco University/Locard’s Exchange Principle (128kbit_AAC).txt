[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, if you've ever taken a forensic
science class, you've probably heard of
[SPEAKER_00]: Lacard's exchange principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a key kind of component of the
forensic science and what forensic
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I should include the quote
from the professor himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lacard's exchange principle states that
wherever he steps, wherever he touches,
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever he leaves, he unconsciously will
serve as a salient witness against him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only his fingerprints or his
footprints, but his hair, the fibers from
[SPEAKER_00]: his clothes, the glass that he breaks,
the tool mark he leaves, the paint that he
[SPEAKER_00]: scratches, the blood or semen he deposits
or collects.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these and more bear mute witness
against him.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is evidence that does not forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not confused by the excitement of
the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not absent because human witnesses
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is factual evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physical evidence cannot be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cannot be prejudiced itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cannot be wholly absent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only human failure to find it,
study, and understand it will dismiss its
[SPEAKER_00]: value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professor Edwin Lacard.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is that key principle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forensic scientists are always looking for
that physical evidence because it isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: prejudiced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need to find it and it could be in
a variety of forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of summarized the general
summary of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever two objects come in contact with
each other, traces of each are exchanged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every contact leaves a trace, whether it's
a small, whether it's something large,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's something very obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every contact will leave some sort of
trace.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's important when going and
investigating a crime scene is not to have
[SPEAKER_00]: any of your own material, anything that
you come in contact with as the scientist
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluating the scene, to have anything
exchanged or kind of contaminate the crime
[SPEAKER_00]: scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this fact is that there is a silent
witness that those investing in the crime
[SPEAKER_00]: scene need to find and interpret them
correctly for the significance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially we might look at this and
just see it's wood, some older wood,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we could see there's some footprints.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there might be also some fibers left
behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be some fingerprints.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be potential blood splatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole different assortment of
things we want to consider and not dismiss
[SPEAKER_00]: as scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every contact leaves a trace.
[SPEAKER_00]: This applies to both the people involved
in the crime scene originally and also,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I said, the investigators.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an investigator, you want to limit your
traces left.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to go into a scene undisturbed
and be able to collect the evidence
[SPEAKER_00]: without kind of adding any of your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having things prepared ahead of time and
knowing what to look for, having an idea
[SPEAKER_00]: what to look for can be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finding the trace.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as easy as in-your-face per se
type of evidence and may be limited to
[SPEAKER_00]: investigators' abilities and or access to
equipment or technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So might see just kind of this blank
blackboard here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you dust it, you could find
fingerprints or trace elements with fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of things and trace
elements is very key and important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's being mindful of what to look for
in knowing how to look for it,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to find it and how to eliminate any
potential contact that you're adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because remember, every contact leaves a
trace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's your ability and hopefully you can
find that in a crime scene and that can
[SPEAKER_00]: really be a very important part of the
diagnosis and evaluation of that crime scene.
