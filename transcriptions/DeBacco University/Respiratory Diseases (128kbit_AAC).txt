[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over some very
common respiratory diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with chronic pulmonary
obstructive disease or abbreviated
[SPEAKER_00]: commonly COPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is exemplified by chronic bronchitis
and obstructive emphysema.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients typically have a history of
smoking, dyspnea, coughing frequently,
[SPEAKER_00]: dyspnea again as labored breathing occurs
and progressively gets worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, COPD victims develop respiratory
failure accompanied by hypoxemia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon dioxide retention and respiratory
acidosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this actually occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's occurring in these individuals?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at normal lungs and the
alveoli, we see a very high amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: surface air which is important to allow
this gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those individuals with COPD, we notice
those alveoli are destroyed forming fewer
[SPEAKER_00]: but larger structures here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This limits or reduces the amount of
efficient transfer of gases that can occur
[SPEAKER_00]: as a result, you can get all of these
negative symptoms that do sadly plague
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on from COPD, we have asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you might be familiar with,
typically more common in children than
[SPEAKER_00]: adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's characterized by shortness of breath,
wheezing and chest tightness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acute inflammation of airways proceeds to
bronchial spasms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's actually occurring in asthma is
our normal pathway for air, it's quite
[SPEAKER_00]: large.
[SPEAKER_00]: In asthma, we have this constriction
that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be thickening of the airway wall,
it could be the constriction, it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: the presence of mucus.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these can lead to asthma-like
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be caused by an immune
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's airway inflammation caused by the
IL-4 and IL-5 which stimulate antibodies
[SPEAKER_00]: and recruit inflammatory cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Airways thicken with inflammation mucus
and magnify the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is typically thought of, if you want
to try to replicate this or simulate this,
[SPEAKER_00]: be like instead of breathing through a
normal airway, to breathe through a very
[SPEAKER_00]: thin and small straw, which is restricting
the ability for air to come in and also
[SPEAKER_00]: for air to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the current asthma rate and
prevalence by age, sex and race,
[SPEAKER_00]: ethnicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by age, child is more likely to become
infected than adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Females, for whatever reason, are more
likely than males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And compared to whites, blacks and
Hispanic races, black tends to be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit higher than both Hispanic and white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inhalers are common ways to reduce the
short-term effectiveness of having this
[SPEAKER_00]: potential issue occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lung cancer is another, sadly,
respiratory disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It counts for about one-third of all
cancer deaths in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of all patients with lung cancer
weren't once smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three common types and these all
fall under the category of lung cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's scrimmage cell carcinoma,
there's adenocarcinoma, small cell
[SPEAKER_00]: carcinomas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to get too much into the specifics,
but simply what's occurring here is we
[SPEAKER_00]: have our nice healthy lungs and we have
our, sadly, our affected lungs with smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is increasing the rate or the chance
dramatically of contracting lung cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look on the packets of cigarettes,
they do warn you about smoking can cause
[SPEAKER_00]: lung cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to lung cancer, it's also
heart disease and many other, sadly,
[SPEAKER_00]: negative effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question comes up, commonly,
about what about e-cigarettes?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all know that the traditional
smoking has those warnings.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about e-cigarettes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're smokeless tobacco and
water pipes and they cause serious
[SPEAKER_00]: potential health problems, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can include cancer because of the
chemicals and toxins that they contain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually currently an active
e-cigarette lawsuit for lack of a cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the potential health risks,
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food and Drug Administration, we know them
as the FDA, has started regulating these
[SPEAKER_00]: products like other tobacco products,
such as cigarettes, on August 8th of 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of burning tobacco, they generally
contain cartridges filled with nicotine
[SPEAKER_00]: and other chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just because it's not an actual
smoking or burning of a potential leaf or
[SPEAKER_00]: other product, there is cancer-associated
risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to check out the links I
provided you with to kind of stress some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the point of some of the potential
risks with e-cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, looking across the country,
at lung cancer incidence, the above map
[SPEAKER_00]: shows lung cancer incidence in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the region here in the south
tends to have a little bit higher
[SPEAKER_00]: incidence of lung cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lack of uniformity in the
population percentage that smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this suggests there may be other
environmental factors to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most carcinogens are also mutagens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while smoking can increase your lung
cancer chance, there's not necessarily a
[SPEAKER_00]: direct correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some other factors also playing
into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we look at this data,
looking at our cigarettes smoked and our
[SPEAKER_00]: lung cancer deaths, we do see a definite
correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the incidence of smoking began to
increase in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: so did the incidence of lung cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cigarette smoke contains these powerful
mutagens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Benzopurines bind to three sites of the
P53 gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: These mutations at these sites activate
the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research has found that the P53 gene is
activated in 70% of all lung cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is showing this correlation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nicotine in cigarette smoke is also a
very addictive drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have other negative side
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The important thing to look at this graph,
or at least to kind of give hope for the
[SPEAKER_00]: future, is that while cigarette smoking
did increase and did lung cancer deaths,
[SPEAKER_00]: we notice a decrease in cigarettes being
smoked and a decrease in lung cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that e-cigarettes also have
their potential cancer risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you're not smoking a
traditional cigar or cigarette,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's also cancer in the lung.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the risk associated with those?
What are the risk associated with those?
Thank you.
