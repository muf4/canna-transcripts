[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to describe why if
you're going snorkeling, it's easier to
[SPEAKER_00]: hold your breath after you inhale a bunch
of air than after you exhale, here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why is it easier to hold your breath
after your inhalation than after
[SPEAKER_00]: exhalation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this actually is because your body
cannot detect low oxygen levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: can only sense high carbon dioxide levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your brain actually uses blood carbon
dioxide levels as an indicator for blood
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when carbon dioxide levels are too
high, you're signaled to take a breath at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as you can see here in the whales,
they're taking a breath before they're
[SPEAKER_00]: descending, they're filling their lungs
full of oxygen, and this is why it allows
[SPEAKER_00]: them to submerge for long periods of time.
So, if you're going to take a breath after
you inhale a bunch of oxygen, you're
signaled to take a breath before you're
descending.
