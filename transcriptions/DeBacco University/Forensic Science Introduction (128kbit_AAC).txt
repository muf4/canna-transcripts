[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to provide a brief
introduction to forensic science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nature of forensic science,
well, let's start with just defining the
[SPEAKER_00]: terms here that are included.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, forensics is scientific
tests used in connection with the
[SPEAKER_00]: detection of a crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can, as you can see up here,
it can be involving certain laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go over more details in
other videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can involve eyewitness testimony.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dealing with other aspects of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all centered around the detection
of a crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other part of that science is an
intellectual and practical activity
[SPEAKER_00]: encompassing the systematic study of the
structure and behavior of physical and
[SPEAKER_00]: natural world through the observations and
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a pretty long definition for a single
word there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what that science is, is kind of
that application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while forensics is detection of a
crime, using the science components,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is how we take that as practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Practical and systematic approach to
analyzing a crime scene and how we go
[SPEAKER_00]: about pulling out the information,
identifying information, and developing
[SPEAKER_00]: potential tests to encode for and provide
data in detail on observations that may be
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So putting it together, science as it
relates to the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is that lab based component,
but then there is also the law because a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of times forensic science people are
going in front of courts, in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: juries, in court settings, and they have
to be able to argue and provide evidence
[SPEAKER_00]: that they found through their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It usually has a crime scene processing
protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how it kind of goes through
and how to break down what's going on in a
[SPEAKER_00]: crime scene to be able to gain information
without altering what might be going on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be presented in a official
base in front of a jury in a court
[SPEAKER_00]: setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of just a very basic
introduction to forensic science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other videos in this channel will go
through a lot more detail.
