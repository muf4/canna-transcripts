[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to be looking at
testimonial evidence and how it may relate
[SPEAKER_00]: to a witness that might be brought in to
relay what they saw at a crime scene,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, eyewitness evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be oral or written statements.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be useful to help an
investigation, but are not considered
[SPEAKER_00]: highly reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though a lot of effort may go into
finding a witness, their evidence that
[SPEAKER_00]: they provide is often not considered to be
highly reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a court setting, eyewitness testimony
can have an influence on the trial,
[SPEAKER_00]: though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important to remember this
balance between what actually happened and
[SPEAKER_00]: what is reliable evidence and what may
influence the jury during the trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the same, but different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two people can view the same scene in
different ways, which can be due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: simple angle that they were viewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It occurred in the middle of the street
and it was one person on one side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: street or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one person in the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's simple angle of viewing depending
on cars in the way or other objects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Familiar with the area, is this someone
that was visiting the area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this someone who's lived there a long
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: That can also influence how much detail
they're able to provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Age of the individual, race of the witness
and the suspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drug use, whether they want to admit it or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Person's ability to remember the details
and basically other stories that might get
[SPEAKER_00]: involved or layered in that may distract
from the original occurrence of the crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So age impacts eyewitness accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's interesting is that young
children and the elderly have a high rate
[SPEAKER_00]: of accuracy when a lineup contains the
actual suspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when the suspect is not present,
this increases the rate of mistaken
[SPEAKER_00]: identities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you have a lineup of five
people here, hope that you'd have the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual person that's guilty there,
but we have to remember that it may not
[SPEAKER_00]: always be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there could be mistaken identities.
[SPEAKER_00]: People could think that, oh yeah,
I'm not sure I remember exactly how they
[SPEAKER_00]: looked, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It really looked a lot like, you know,
number two here or something that can lead
[SPEAKER_00]: to that false or mistaken identities and
then lead them to develop their own story
[SPEAKER_00]: in their head, even though it may not be
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Race has an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are generally able more
accurately identify people of their own
[SPEAKER_00]: race.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important when we're looking at
someone pointing someone out of a lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is someone of a different race,
the odds are of mistaken identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chances increase if that race is
different than the person doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drugs alter your memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drugs use can impact a person's ability to
remember events, even after the drug
[SPEAKER_00]: effects are no longer active.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this could have an influence based on
their memory, and they may not want to
[SPEAKER_00]: admit that they use drugs during,
before, or after, especially if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just, again, something to
consider when looking at eyewitness
[SPEAKER_00]: testimony.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, pure influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone's testimony can be influenced by
other witnesses' accounts of the events.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they hear what someone else said,
they might kind of be leaning in that
[SPEAKER_00]: direction or kind of go down the wrong
path.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why open-ended questions tend to
be used to allow the witness to not be
[SPEAKER_00]: guided by how the question was asked,
trying to leave it more open-ended rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than kind of getting into exact detail,
even though that's what somebody may want
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're kind of interrogating or
interviewing someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also keeping them isolated,
not allowing them to hear other people's
[SPEAKER_00]: testimony can also be beneficial,
that they won't kind of be influenced by
[SPEAKER_00]: other stories that they may hear.
