[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at a very common
question of should I get separate
[SPEAKER_00]: germination or propagation media and
should I get separate grow media or can I
[SPEAKER_00]: just get one?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're familiar with the germination
process and what that requires starting
[SPEAKER_00]: from seed and then the grow process of the
actual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of these can have a specific media
associated with that, but is it worth
[SPEAKER_00]: going through that extra step there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, let's look at our
germination media, also sometimes called
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: These contains typically smaller particles
that help improve the soil to seed
[SPEAKER_00]: contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that we need to keep moisture
levels consistent with the seed to help
[SPEAKER_00]: increase our germination rate and this is
especially important for smaller sized
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can help reduce transplant shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's important to use a
propagation mix when looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: propagating or starting, especially small
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that grow formulation,
they contain larger particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They help aeration for the growing of
whole sized plants as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our roots need to be able to breathe,
even in the container here, we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow this increased porosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that goes back to the question
of should we get specialized formulations
[SPEAKER_00]: of propagation and grow media?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you look for looking to maximize each
step of the process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes, but if we're only going to
choose one, grow formulations can be used
[SPEAKER_00]: for propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to spend extra careful attention
at keeping the media moist and it may
[SPEAKER_00]: require increased misting events or
keeping that humidity a little bit higher
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in the early phases of the
germination process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that answers and clarifies some
of the germination versus grow medias and
[SPEAKER_00]: how each is specifically designed to be
used.
Thank you.
