[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm going to talk about reverse
osmosis water, or often referred to as
[SPEAKER_00]: simply RO water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I go into kind of reverse
osmosis, you kind of need to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what osmosis is and how that operates in a
general sense, because this kind of works
[SPEAKER_00]: its way backwards with filters and
membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, before I talk about eating
osmosis, let's talk about diffusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diffusion is the movement of molecules
from an area of high concentration to an
[SPEAKER_00]: area of low concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do we see that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the drop of food dye diffusing out
in the container here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Area of high concentration, equally
spreading out to an area of low
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as this occur, well simply the natural
movement of the molecules here will
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually kind of stir this up and allow
it to become homogenized here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So osmosis is the movement of water
through a semi-permeable membrane from
[SPEAKER_00]: less concentrated solution to more
concentrated solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's a semi-permeable membrane refer
to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well here, it's a membrane where only some
things can pass through.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the large red molecules can't pass
through here, but the smaller purple,
[SPEAKER_00]: green, and yellow ones can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's semi-permeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things can pass through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the evidence here, moving from less
concentrated solution to more
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a less concentrated
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our semi-permeable membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water is going to move across.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here, where that water level
has now increased on this side and
[SPEAKER_00]: decreased on this side.
[SPEAKER_00]: A delta change in H, change in height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll notice at the end, the
concentration of dissolved salts on the
[SPEAKER_00]: left and right side is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we can see there's much more water
than there are the dissolved salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because water moved across here,
we now have an even spread between these
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is between the semi-permeable
membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the dissolved salts cannot
move across that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is osmosis as it naturally occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about reverse osmosis now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an apparatus used to separate the
dissolved solids from water, but utilizing
[SPEAKER_00]: a semi-permeable membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of the same terms we just talked
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The separation of dissolved solids from
water is what's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this forces pure water through a
membrane with the goals to produce as
[SPEAKER_00]: close to pure water as possible with an
electroconductivity and EC of zero,
[SPEAKER_00]: or as close to zero as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often to reduce the EC of water by nearing
zero by removing the minerals is the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why reverse osmosis is used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's used quite frequently,
especially for hydroponic production.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, it filters out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Filters are utilized to separate out clean
water from waste water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be kind of this constant flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see a lot of tubings here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a waste water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a end result, or osmosis,
reverse osmosis end water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the water you're going to want
to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it does is what it can do is it
can turn salt water into fresh water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are filters or membranes that
need to be changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see here natural osmosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to take these where these few salt
particles are, move across this area of
[SPEAKER_00]: the membrane to this side.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the reverse osmosis is, it's working
in the opposite way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taking water and forcing it across
this membrane where it doesn't want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there will be a couple molecules that
will sneak through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, this will be very
close to pure water through these
[SPEAKER_00]: membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these need to be changed over time
because they can clog based on the water
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to purify.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to keep the system clean to
help reduce the chance of microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: developing in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can develop sometimes on these
membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they need to be changed regularly
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just a good idea to just make
sure that you're not allowing algae growth
[SPEAKER_00]: on them, putting them in a sunny location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take extra measures to keep them as
clean as possible so they'll last as long
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible so you can produce quality RO
water for your grow operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
