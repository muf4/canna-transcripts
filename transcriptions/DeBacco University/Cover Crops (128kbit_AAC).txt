[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a quick overview of
cover crops, which are simply living
[SPEAKER_00]: carpets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an example of a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a crop that's grown to cover and
protect the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the pros and cons to
cover crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: The pros is you get soil stabilization,
soil rotation, you get different root
[SPEAKER_00]: structures in there, nutrient holding,
you can attract beneficial insects,
[SPEAKER_00]: in particular buckwheat is good at doing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cons, I really don't know of any.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find out anything, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers may complain there might be a
little hard to deal with, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: what you grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, there's a lot of benefits
to these that I don't really know too many
[SPEAKER_00]: negatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: The selection process is important,
and in part, it's season dependent,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on when you want to grow the
cover crop, either over the winter or
[SPEAKER_00]: during the summer if you're resting in an
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winter in New England is most limiting
because of our simple lack of warm
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures to grow any sort of crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blends get a lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say, I want to do a blend in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how many do you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's basically three classifications,
despite all the different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's grasses, there's legumes,
which you should inoculate in some way,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the brassicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I provided a link here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, in the description, you'll find a
link to the lecture slides and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: sources for all the images.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to click on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's produced by NRCS, and they do a
pretty good job of summarizing some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you just a quick idea,
New England standards for the winter time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winter rise, the name implies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can germinate basically any temperature
above 32 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any temperature above freezing,
it can germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be slow, but it can germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hairy vetch is another option,
the one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great at fixing nitrogen,
but it fixes most of its nitrogen just
[SPEAKER_00]: before flowering, late in the growth
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see the purple flowers,
that's the sign it's fixing as much
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen as possible, and you want to go
through and kill it, otherwise it becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: like rope and can wrap around your
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be an issue, but if you kill the
right time, there should be no problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winter rye can get very tall and can
germinate at very low temperatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically seeded in the late fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these are winter hardy and will
survive harsh New England winters.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the summer, now if we're looking at
resting an area or we have an issue and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can't get into a field and want to rest
that for the summer, we have buckwheat or
[SPEAKER_00]: Sudan grass would be two great options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buckwheat grows really quick, but be
careful it can reseed itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see the white flowers here,
this is again a sign you want to come
[SPEAKER_00]: through and kill it in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does attract beneficial insects,
so you're kind of playing the line there
[SPEAKER_00]: of how long do you keep it up to keep the
insects in the area or risk the chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: it reseeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when it has reseeded, at least in the
situations that I have seen, it hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: been really that aggressive, so it's not a
major concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sudan grass grows very tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a special equipment to manage it
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of this as like corn without the
ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it looks like corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can get really tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six feet even taller and it can get really
thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be difficult to deal with if you
don't have specialized equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of be able to get in there or shuck
it down, beat it up pretty good,
[SPEAKER_00]: mow it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to just make sure you have
something or plan for it to have something
[SPEAKER_00]: if you do plan on growing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others, red clover, tillage radish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red clover is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows really low.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can help fix nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tillage radish is getting a lot of
attention to kind of break up heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: compacted soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do use tillage radish, be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't over seed it with too much other
than the recommendation says because when
[SPEAKER_00]: these do go to rot, they can produce quite
the odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be mindful of your neighbors in that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the plantings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a pretty small planting per acre as
far as seeds go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't over add because they can produce
quite the odor again when they do go to
[SPEAKER_00]: rot after they perform their job here
busting into thick soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should you fertilize your cover crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: The simple answer, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave no in a bunch of different
languages here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, if your cover crop does not look
a little deficient, odds are you may have
[SPEAKER_00]: over fertilized in season anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your cover crop does not necessarily
have to be lush, dark, green.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a sign you may have over added
nutrients in season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But should you actually fertilize it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, let it grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can actually show you where some good
or poor areas might be in your field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, consider cover crops potentially
in season to under seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under seed your cash crop at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a grass mix under some corn here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is possible to actually have a
living carpet under your potential cash
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, again, depending what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clover could be used in walkways or lower
growing crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, grass could be used for kind of
another grass, corn, just a way to help
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilize soil and reduce weed pressure,
again, in certain cases.
Thank you.
