[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be looking at a population lab with
yeast feeding it different sugar solutions
[SPEAKER_00]: to see how that changes the yeast
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so today's lab is going to be
looking at growing yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have some yeast and we have some
different sugar solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take a look and see what
sugar solution the yeast prefers as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: what does it grow the best in.
[SPEAKER_00]: How we're going to do that is by measuring
or observing the amount of carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: that is produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to develop a way to capture
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to be using fermentation
test tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are large test tubes and regular
small test tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show you how we're going to
set these up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, this shows the basic lab,
how it should look in the end with our
[SPEAKER_00]: molasses and honey solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll also be preparing our refined sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our stock solutions of honey,
refined sugar, and molasses, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: our yeast suspension ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take our large beakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to hold everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful, this is all a glassware.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have one of the small test tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now measuring the exact amount of liquid
isn't that important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure we're going to fill
this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have molasses, regular refined
sucrose or sugar, and then I have honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of these are a 20% solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've allocated them out into small
beakers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we take our test tube, we take our
honey solution, which is 20%, we add
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately halfway full of our honey
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our honey solution there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to take about 20 drops,
which is going to equal one milliliter of
[SPEAKER_00]: our yeast solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our yeast solution, we can
clearly see is kind of separated out from
[SPEAKER_00]: the honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to just kind of mix that in to
get a good, even distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to fill the test tube
back up with that 20% honey solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: As close to the top as we can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take our fermentation test tube,
now we've got that full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take our fermentation test tube,
add that over the top here, carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all is glassware.
[SPEAKER_00]: Push that up to the very top, as we can
see there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're just going to kind of flip
this over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to measure the air
bubble that's been produced there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time, that yeast is going to
grow, the CO2 gets captured, and we'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to measure that over a period of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to repeat that also with the
other sugar solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here, pretty much around
the same air bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see how they look tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've given our yeast some time to
grow, and there are various sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see there's varying degrees of
happiness going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the molasses, we have the honey,
and then we have the refined sugar,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the clear one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that there is a difference
between the amount of carbon dioxide gas
[SPEAKER_00]: produced, the amount of bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greater the bubble height,
the greater the amount of yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our example here, the molasses
definitely has the greatest bubble,
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating that the yeast is growing the
best in this sugar solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would then be followed by our
sucrose, our refined sugar, located right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, it looks like in this example
here, the honey had the least amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast growth, relating directly to the
least amount of carbon dioxide produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to quantify this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're simply going to take a ruler,
and we're going to measure in millimeters
[SPEAKER_00]: the height of that bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to go through and we're
going to take the area from the height of
[SPEAKER_00]: that bubble to basically the height of
that test tube and measure that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And compare that to our reading we
originally took when we initially flipped
[SPEAKER_00]: everything over and got the initial
bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We left usually just a little bit of a
bubble there to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're able to see how much gas was
produced, directly correlating to the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of yeast here, the population of
the yeast in this sugar solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we can clearly see those
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, again, the molasses producing the
most.
[SPEAKER_00]: In comparison, the honey here has the
least amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the refined sugar is clear,
liquid solution, so a little harder to
[SPEAKER_00]: see, but that had the second most.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're looking here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're directly correlating carbon dioxide
production to yeast population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to go through and we're
going to measure in millimeters the height
of that bubble.
And we're going to take the area from the
height of that bubble to basically the
height of that test tube.
