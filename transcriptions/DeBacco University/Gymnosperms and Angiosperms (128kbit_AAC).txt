[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, in this video we're going to look at
gymnosperms and angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know at this point,
gymnosperms typically look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at pine trees being a prime
example and angiosperms being plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: are producing flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gymnosperms, let's start with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is different phyllo that consists of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to focus mainly just on two main
ones here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conifers is probably what you're most
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trees that produce their seeds and
cones and most have needle-like leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be an example of conifers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put another example of a conifer
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be familiar with zing or
ginkgoes or at least familiar hearing
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only one living species left, but what
makes them distinctive is that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: these fan-shaped leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both of these are gymnosperms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want you to think it's just only
needle-like leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also have these kind of
fan-shaped leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these would be classified both as what
we call naked seed plants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And angiosperms are going to be those
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these don't actually produce set
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're producing, in this case,
these cones, but they both are producing
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sticking with those gymnosperms,
a life cycle of conifers is typical of
[SPEAKER_00]: gymnosperms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're using them kind of as our
example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conifers come from two types of cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed cones contain the female
gametophytes, and it's located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then pollen cones contain pollen grains,
which is the male gametophytes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen grains are dispersed by wind to the
seed cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fertilized seed cones produce seeds,
which are also wind dispersed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The germinated seed will grow into a new
sporophyte plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever looked out, particularly
the springtime, and it looks like a pine
[SPEAKER_00]: tree is on fire, it looks like it's smoke
is pouring off it, it's literally the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what these gymnosperms do, in this case
these conifers, they're producing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're dispersing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get through the air in hopes that
just by mass producing pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're able by odds to get the male
pollen grains to find the female ovule
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they're just producing tons and
tons and tons of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can almost look like smoke coming off a
tree to find that female ovule.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, angiosperms,
they produce flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They invest a lot of energy in these
flowers to attract pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little different reproductive
strategy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of all living plant species are
angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Virtually all of our food is derived
directly or indirectly from angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Angiosperms use flower to induce insects
and other animals to carry pollen for
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an example here, instead of these
plants investing a ton of energy in
[SPEAKER_00]: producing a lot of just pollen grains and
hoping it makes it with the wind,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're investing their energy in
producing less pollen, but spending time
[SPEAKER_00]: to attract pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower anatomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the basic structure of flower consists
of four distinctive circles here or whorls
[SPEAKER_00]: connected to the base here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four key terms, sepals are the outermost
whorl and typically protect the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: from physical damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The petals we're probably most familiar
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the second whorl to serve to
attract pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what usually looks pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stamens contain the male parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That produce the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the tip of the filament is an anter
that contains the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that kind of zoomed in portion
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This green region here, the pistol or the
carpal, contains the female parts that
[SPEAKER_00]: produce the egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ovules occur at the bulging base of
the carpal called the ovary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stalk is called the stile and this
gives rise from the ovary to the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the sticky tip called the stigma which
receives the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes this portion here,
stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to think of sticky stigma
and then the stile and then we have down
[SPEAKER_00]: here the ovary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pollen needs to go from the anter here
to be transferred to this stigma so it can
[SPEAKER_00]: reach the ovary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good terms, you should be kind of
reviewing and familiar with and be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify different parts of the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, looking at that slightly different
image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the same thing, the carpals,
the stamens, the petals, the sepals on a
[SPEAKER_00]: different flower here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't just accustom to just this
one single set image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be able to recognize it on different
images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a lot of the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female and male parts and Christmas
Lilium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very distinctive pollen grains here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we notice our stigma, our sticky
stigma on the pollen needs to get from
[SPEAKER_00]: here to here and travel down here to the
ovule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, zooming in on those parts here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting myself over to this side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that there is a very
similar, distinctive regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to be able to distinguish the
different male and female portions and
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that the stigma, the stile,
and the ovary, the ovule here,
[SPEAKER_00]: are all part of the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen grains, the microspores,
the anthers, the filaments, all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: are portions of the male parts of the
flower.
