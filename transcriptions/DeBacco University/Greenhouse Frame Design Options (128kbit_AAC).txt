[SPEAKER_00]: And when looking at greenhouse frame
design options, there's many to choose
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's actually an image from the New
York Botanical Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while this may look like an impressive
frame design structure, it's rarely used
[SPEAKER_00]: in production due to some of its
inefficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some more efficient designs, one's called
the Northeaster version.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has a peak in the middle to deal with
snow that's common in the Northeast United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very strong, freestanding
greenhouse structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also often has a truss support
system to offer even more strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this design, this peak design,
ideally reduces the chance of snow
[SPEAKER_00]: building up on top, as we see on this car.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of it building up, it can kind
of work its way and slide off that
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse with hopefully minimal effort
or labor needed from the outside to help
[SPEAKER_00]: remove that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what has that well-defined peak in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that does not have the peak,
but is also designed to really maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: that floor space, so it's called a
traditional hoop house.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tend to be cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very simple and easy to construct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see them on the larger scale
here and here, and also on the smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: scale here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That inherent curved design is very
supportive and allows the structure to be
[SPEAKER_00]: very strong, even though it's just a very
simple hoop design.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a high side frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: This increases the greenhouse height to
allow for increased internal space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it easier to put benches upright
to the side walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, this increased height creates
a greater distance between the very hot
[SPEAKER_00]: air to the crop level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can be advantageous, especially if
you're growing into kind of extending the
[SPEAKER_00]: season, where you still maybe have an
early warm-up or a late warm-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also help moderate those
temperatures, at least at the crop level,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the open roof design.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the most expensive design for
greenhouses due to the ingenuity to open
[SPEAKER_00]: the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see we have some partially open
roofs here and then a full open roof here.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is the most efficient
cooling method because all the hot air
[SPEAKER_00]: rises, so this is an excellent venting
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, when they open the entire way,
really efficiently allows that heat to be
[SPEAKER_00]: vented out of the greenhouse very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, I think this is kind of the
best design in the sense that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: venting the hottest air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're allowing for great air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very passive system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does require a lot of ingenuity
here and structure to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, looking at a permanent
structure, this might be worth an option
[SPEAKER_00]: considering and see if you can justify the
upright cost.
