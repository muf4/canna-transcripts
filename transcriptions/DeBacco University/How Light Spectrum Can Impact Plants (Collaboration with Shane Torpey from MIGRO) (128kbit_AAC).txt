[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University collaboration
video with Shane from MiGrow, we'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: investigating how a light spectrum can
impact plants, looking at spectrum versus
[SPEAKER_00]: yield, as well as spectrum versus
cannabinoid production, as well as a few
[SPEAKER_00]: other common questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Shane here from MiGrow,
and we're going to be discussing a topic
[SPEAKER_00]: that I know gets a lot of attention,
and that's spectrums when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: plant production and optimizing those
spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing new lighting technology come
out with all sorts of dials and options on
[SPEAKER_00]: it to modify and change blue light,
red light, and different kind of ratios
[SPEAKER_00]: between those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to get into a little bit
more of the details here, and we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane to help us provide us some
background for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking, Shane, as we're looking at our
optimizing spectrum, how does this change
[SPEAKER_00]: as the plant grows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to give the plants the same
thing the whole time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to modify things?
[SPEAKER_00]: How would we modify it as that plant goes
from that early stage through the veg into
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase?
[SPEAKER_01]: I suppose it's useful to put a bit of
perspective here and a few reference
[SPEAKER_01]: points for people with regard to spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we take sunlight spectrum, what plants
have evolved to work with, to absorb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sunlight spectrum has about 25% blue and
then about equally just close to 40% green
[SPEAKER_01]: and red in terms of its overall
composition.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is, of course, UVB, UVA,
and far red in that spectrum as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have established through
experimentation that for efficient
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis, really plants only really
absorb the PAR range efficiently,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is from 400 to 700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a little bit of photosynthesis
happening beyond that range, that PAR
[SPEAKER_01]: range, but it is the most efficient within
that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of looking at the effect on plant
shape and development and quality then,
[SPEAKER_01]: as we said before in previous videos,
blue is very important in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: regulating plant height, particularly for
indoor growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having at least a minimum amount of 3%
or 4% blue is essential to have short and
[SPEAKER_01]: dense growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: An absence of blue would have very tall,
stretchy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having a high proportion of blue is
critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, in terms of modern lighting
technology, grow lighting technology,
[SPEAKER_01]: most growers these days are using LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take, for example, even a
relatively warm color spectrum,
[SPEAKER_01]: so something in the color temperature
range of say 2,000, 2,500, you would still
[SPEAKER_01]: have around 7% or 8% blue even in that
relatively warm spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's plenty for short and dense
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically grow light manufacturers
these days have a mixed color temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're using cool white and warm
white LEDs together and often 660
[SPEAKER_01]: nanometer or deep red LEDs as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those combined together usually result
in a color temperature of about 3,500K.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has a percentage blue of about
12% to 14%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plenty for short and dense growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, as we just discussed before,
the proportion of green and red really is
[SPEAKER_01]: not critical in terms of the plant shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are fairly neutral in terms of how
that plant is going to develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is an argument for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we covered this before about using
far red, for example, at the early stages
[SPEAKER_01]: of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Far red can increase the leaf size in
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that benefit is marginal and
limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And often with these things, it's a
compromise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do one thing and it'll affect
something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So using too much far red, you will get
tall, stretchy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in summary, in terms of the modern tech
that we have, which is white LEDs mixed
[SPEAKER_01]: with 660 nanometer red, they are really
very close to what we would want as an
[SPEAKER_01]: optimum to deliver efficient rate of
photosynthesis, develop healthy plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are short and dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the main characteristics we
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we said previously, under white
light, we can visually inspect them and
[SPEAKER_01]: see them clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at these spectrums in these
spectrum recipes that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have access to dialing in literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is this compared to sunlight?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I touched on some of the percentages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we just kind of, if we have the
option, why don't we just set all the
[SPEAKER_00]: dials to basically sunlight and kind of
leave it at that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why should we bother messing and pushing
or changing things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we just get the option,
make it sunlight?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what plants are used to and just
kind of leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the advantage of going through and
optimizing our spectrum?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we absolutely could.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could have, for example, white LEDs and
we could add far red LEDs and we could add
[SPEAKER_01]: UVA LEDs and even UVB LEDs to mimic the
sun spectrum as close as we possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: could.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it would cost a lot more to do
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from a couple of points, first of all,
the UVA LEDs and UVB LEDs are more
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive than the white ones in terms of
the amount of photons you get per watt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the dollars per watt that you're
spending on those LEDs in the first
[SPEAKER_01]: instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And secondarily, they're not as
photosynthetically efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't contribute as efficiently to
photosynthesis as our white range of our
[SPEAKER_01]: power range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on two fronts, you're spending more
upfront on the fixture cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then secondarily, it's going to cost
more in electricity terms to provide these
[SPEAKER_01]: wavelengths, which are not necessarily
beneficial to the mass of plant we're
[SPEAKER_01]: producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the rate of growth and the yield that
we're going to ultimately get or the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality of the produce that we're going to
come out with in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not shown, you know, changing your
color temperature, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: changing the proportion of blue is not
shown to change the the percentage of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids or the potency of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not really shown to have much of
any other quality of effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, if you want to grow as much as
possible, stay within the efficient power
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, that coincides with they are
the cheaper photons to produce and a
[SPEAKER_01]: cheaper fixture cost to purchase in the
first instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of along the lines of just
because we can, doesn't mean we should
[SPEAKER_00]: type thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really taking that maximum efficiency
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of taking the sunlight and using
that as a gauge, but then narrowing it
[SPEAKER_00]: down to really what the plants are
utilizing from all that light that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just touched on this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got previous videos on the PAR,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just going over just a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at this efficient
spectrum that comes back again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think to PAR again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just kind of reiterate just for
everyone what that PAR is and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: where that efficiency lies in our lighting
that is going to produce the most of our
[SPEAKER_00]: plants as efficiently as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a scientist called McCree developed
the McCree curve, which is still used
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is a it was experiments were done
to look at the effect of different
[SPEAKER_01]: wavelengths of light on the rate of
photosynthesis and plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was done for a wide range of
plants under different conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was shown that again, the most
photosynthesis happens in the PAR range
[SPEAKER_01]: between 400 and 700.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a trail off or a tail off on each
end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So UVA does cause it somewhat,
although it reduces as you go into shorter
[SPEAKER_01]: wavelengths and far red causes
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within the PAR range, red is
considered to be the most
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthetically efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue is the next most photosynthetically
efficient and green the last.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is not a huge difference between
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we've said before, it is you do
need a proportion of blue in that
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need a certain amount of it to get
the right plant shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with green, it may not be as
photosynthetically efficient in narrow
[SPEAKER_01]: terms, but in terms of the whole plant
photosynthesis, green penetrates deeper
[SPEAKER_01]: into the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gets to cells which other which
which blue or red photons wouldn't reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And green, green photons also banks around
the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get to parts of the plant that green
and red photons wouldn't reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having that mix of blue, green and red
leads to a more efficient system overall
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of the lighting efficiency and
also the overall rate of photosynthesis of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for providing that breakdown on
those important wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully no one's setting your dials
to sunlight or setting a color wavelength
[SPEAKER_00]: to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not the most efficient utilizing
that and kind of work on that recipe as we
[SPEAKER_00]: would for nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work on that recipe for optimum lighting
spectrum also plays into the efficiency of
[SPEAKER_00]: plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it all come back to PAR?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it all come back to kind of this
greater understanding, hopefully the new
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific research that will continue to
come out?
