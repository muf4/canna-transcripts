[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're gonna look at muscle basics
explained.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're trying to open that pickle
jar and you feel the strain on the
[SPEAKER_00]: muscles, you get an appreciation for
what's actually going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have myofibrils, which are why
striations are seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at this kind of image here
of the muscle, you notice we have
[SPEAKER_00]: myofibrils.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're densely packed rod-like
contractile elements called myocytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see these kind of like fibers,
like a bundle of fibers all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make up the vast majority of the
muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also notice within these myofibrils,
they're perfectly aligned within the
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all nicely organized and they
create repeating series of dark A-bands
[SPEAKER_00]: and light I-bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how I can try to remember that is the
I-band in the second letter is I in light
[SPEAKER_00]: and the second letter in dark is A and
that's that kind of A-band.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dark A-bands and light I-bands as we
see here and you'll see nuclei kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: oriented around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now within this, we have the sarcomeres
and the banding patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're looking at one specific kind
of fiber, if you will here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're composed of thin filaments that do
not overlap thick filaments in the lighter
[SPEAKER_00]: H-zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have these kind of like overlapping
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we've gone to the sarcomeres in
the banding pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have thin filaments that do not overlap
thick filaments in the lighter H-zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this M-lines that appear darker
due to the presence of desmin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at kind of our sarcomere
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have kind of all of these kind of like
lines and these thick and these thin
[SPEAKER_00]: filaments and they kind of like are right
next to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not kind of like they're not over
not on top of one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of like all in the spaces
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the smallest contractile units
of the muscle in the region of the
[SPEAKER_00]: myofibril between two successive Z-discs
or Z-lines here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can kind of see this kind of section
here within these muscle fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regular organization of these
sarcomeres give skeletal and cardiac
[SPEAKER_00]: muscles their distinctive striated
appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're composed of those myofirils
made of those contractile proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those myofilaments are composed of the
thick myosin and thin actin filaments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here the thin is represented by the
blue and the thick by the red lines here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sarcomere and sliding filament model of
contraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because they're not directly
overlaid because they're like right on top
[SPEAKER_00]: of one another what they're doing is
they're kind of sliding across.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of use the cuffs of my hand of
my arms here and we kind of have a space
[SPEAKER_00]: between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start here and then they'll become
they'll get closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's happening in this
sliding filament theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the contraction of muscles the
myosin retracts along the actin
[SPEAKER_00]: myofilaments compressing the I and the H
bands together.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the stretching this tension is
released and the I and the E bands expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The A band remains consistent throughout
the length of the myosin myofilaments does
[SPEAKER_00]: not change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the length of my arms and hands
don't change, but they're simply sliding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're completely reducing the area or
the distance between the ends there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is this contraction that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here the relaxed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that large space in the H band and
the contracted with their sliding over one
[SPEAKER_00]: another reducing that H band spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The myofilaments we have a banding
pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have thick filaments extend the entire
length of the A band.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have thin filaments that extend across
the I band and partway through the A band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those zetas are coin-shaped sheets of
proteins and they anchor the thin
[SPEAKER_00]: filaments and connect the myofilaments to
one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have these anchor points to allow
when something contracts to help pull it
[SPEAKER_00]: together because if they just slid all
over the place there'd be no contraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two fibers are sliding across and
that's pulling in the ends there
[SPEAKER_00]: condensing the total length and causing
that contraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tendons and ligaments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tendons are flexible but elastic cords
that are strong fibers, collagen,
[SPEAKER_00]: and tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part with a tendon is it attaches
muscle to bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example would be a hamstring or
quadricep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tendons attach muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here directly to bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ligaments are also short bands are tough
flexible fibers connected tissue,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they connect two bones to cartilage or
holds a joint together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ACL is a prime example of here and
they're basically connecting two bones
[SPEAKER_00]: together or two cartilage points as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, tendon is a muscle to a bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: A ligament is linking two bones together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how muscles work in a general sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Muscles are attached to bones,
straps of connected tissue called tendons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bones pivot about flexible joints and
pulled back and forth by those attached
[SPEAKER_00]: muscles to go through and start moving
things around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Muscles only pull, they never push.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an antagonist that allows for
movements in the opposite direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if I move this way,
we have muscles here that are being
[SPEAKER_00]: pulled.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are relaxing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I move my hand back up, the muscles on
the back of my hand, those would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that are contracting and shortening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever a muscle or group of muscles
does another muscle or group undoes that
[SPEAKER_00]: same movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see that here as you're running
and moving your leg, muscles remember are
[SPEAKER_00]: only pulling, they're never pushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how muscles work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's an origin, which is the
muscle and attached to a tendon or
[SPEAKER_00]: stationary bone needs something to pull
against.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the insertion, which is the
attachment to that bone and contractile
[SPEAKER_00]: muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This antagonist is the muscles of a
movable joint is attached to the opposing
[SPEAKER_00]: pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our flexors and extenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can kind of see a great example here of
the hamstring.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that contracts, that's pulling the
leg back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have the extenders here,
the quadricep.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that gets pulled, that's pulling the
leg or the tendon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a prime example of that here of a
soccer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going through and playing that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see this motion right here
where we have, when the arm is coming up,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have these muscles contracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the arm is going down, these are
relaxing, but these are doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: contraction here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two types of muscle contraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's isotonic and isometric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isotonic is when the muscle actually
shortens, thus moving the bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the example that I've given you
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also have something called
isometric, where the muscle does not
[SPEAKER_00]: shorten, but exerts a force.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way I can kind of give this an
example is if you've ever picked up with
[SPEAKER_00]: your arms being straight a five gallon
pail of water that's very heavy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can feel your muscles working,
even though they're not contracting,
[SPEAKER_00]: or even though you're not maybe picking
them up and lifting them, just keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: your muscles straight can also have a
force upon the isometric form of
[SPEAKER_00]: contraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal and atrophied muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So muscle mass reduces muscle atrophies
with dysfunctions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although atrophy due to disuse can often
be reversed with exercise, muscle atrophy
[SPEAKER_00]: with age, referred to as sarcopenota,
is irreversible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why if you have a muscle in a
cast, for example, for an extended period
[SPEAKER_00]: of time that isn't moving, it'll atrophy
and get smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully you can bounce back from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a short period of time and you're
youthful, you can get that muscle back
[SPEAKER_00]: through normal use over time with physical
therapy back to its normal mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Muscle metabolism, energy and contraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with respiration, it's releasing
energy from the sugar to make ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two pathways, aerobic and
anaerobic, basically using oxygen and not
[SPEAKER_00]: using oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aerobic produces, is a preferred method
because it creates a great amount of ATP
[SPEAKER_00]: that your muscles need.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when action gets low,
excessive workout, lactic acid
[SPEAKER_00]: fermentation pathways can be used in favor
to generate some ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's important to note that when
your body uses ATP, protons are being
[SPEAKER_00]: produced, resulting in an acidic
environment and this is what's causing
[SPEAKER_00]: muscle burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people misdiagnose it as being
the lactic acid because they hear the term
[SPEAKER_00]: acid that's causing the muscle burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, it's just the release of
hydrogen ions, protons, in the example
[SPEAKER_00]: from ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lactic acid is slowly converted to
pyruvate in the liver and it can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: help speed the process of reducing the
amount of burn that you may have or
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling in your muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of get the eye twitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may wonder, you know, your muscle
contraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is your eye twitch?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little YouTube video link
there, but mainly it's caused from stress
[SPEAKER_00]: or limited sleep or high caffeine
consumption can help increase the odds of
[SPEAKER_00]: that little muscle twitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, dark meat versus white meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: White meat is fast twitch muscles,
fibers, short energy bursts, and they tire
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have lower fat content and slightly
higher in protein content.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the turkey breast is an
example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark meat is slower twitch muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have long periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have high oxygen content,
high myoglobin content, and also higher
[SPEAKER_00]: fat content.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's mono and polyunsaturated fats are
slightly higher in cholesterol and those
[SPEAKER_00]: will be found in your turkey legs,
wings, and thighs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're having Thanksgiving dinner
and you like white meat versus dark meat,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a great kind of example of exactly
why there's different meat within the
[SPEAKER_00]: same, in this case, turkey because they
serve different purposes.
