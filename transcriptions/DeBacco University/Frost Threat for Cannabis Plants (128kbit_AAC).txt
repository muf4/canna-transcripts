[SPEAKER_00]: Ever wondered how frost impacts cannabis
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in this DeBacco University video,
we're going to go over some of the cold
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance related to cannabis,
as well as I'll take you outside to a
[SPEAKER_00]: field after a cold early fall night to see
how cannabis plants in this various area
[SPEAKER_00]: were impacted by the cold temperatures
that occurred over that night.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go through the frost
threat for cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, how does cold
temperatures impact the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a question that gets asked a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, a true frost is when
temperatures get below 32 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit or zero degrees Celsius,
but temperatures approaching these values
[SPEAKER_00]: can cause damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids are not directly impacted,
but the plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cold temperatures can stunt the plant
and cause stresses, which can limit
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you having a cold night?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you having cold nights?
[SPEAKER_00]: That S on the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: One cold night may be enough to stunt the
plant, but multiple nights of cold
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures, not even below freezing,
can cause plants to completely shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be very hard to get the plants to
restart, even if it gets warm for a period
[SPEAKER_00]: of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not looking at the daytime
temperatures, it's really those nighttime
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures, 33, 32, 31, 32.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be causing some issues there
for any outdoor cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes this leads to what's called a
forced harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: When cold temperatures set in,
this can be a sign to the grower that they
[SPEAKER_00]: need to harvest what they can,
when they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting some harvest is better than
getting no harvest, because if we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to lose the plants to cold, even though
the plants may not be 100% ready,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, it doesn't look good going into the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take what you can get when you can get
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go outside, take a look at some
plants that experienced a pretty chilly
[SPEAKER_00]: night and see how they reacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people will often ask, is cannabis
frost tolerant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people will say yes, some people
will say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while it may be frost tolerant,
it's not very frost tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that perfect example here where
this area outdoors did get hit with a
[SPEAKER_00]: frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing this cannabis plant,
the effects from that frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did it kill the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we look very closely, we see it did
induce a lot of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing a lot of coloration changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of we're not getting that growth
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of really stunted a lot of the growth
factor, stunted a lot of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it didn't kill it, it definitely
set it back and kind of damaged that
[SPEAKER_00]: structure in the sense that if possible,
you want to do your best to avoid frost on
[SPEAKER_00]: your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you get a frost soon after,
try to get through and harvest them
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're not going to get much
after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's only going to cause a chance that
other bad things could happen and you
[SPEAKER_00]: could lose the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an area that got hit with some
recent frosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an outdoor grove.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can obviously tell, and you're
noticing plants respond in different ways
[SPEAKER_00]: to the frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some get definitely this more yellow
coloration to the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some get more of that purple coloration as
anthocyanins to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, if you just look down this
little row here, we could see that no
[SPEAKER_00]: matter how the plants responded to the
frost, either way was not very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to boast well for future
improvement on harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis plants definitely,
can tolerate some frost, but not really
[SPEAKER_00]: something you want to expose them to.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can see here, where at least these
cultivars definitely have kind of reached
[SPEAKER_00]: their peak and should be harvested soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we're not going to get too much
more progression on their growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's only a chance that other negative
factors could occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: More frost, other damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be best to get these out of the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here we're talking about frost damage
and how that affects plants differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another plant outside,
a little closer to a tree and as you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see right behind me, so not necessarily
hit quite as hard with the frost as some
[SPEAKER_00]: others maybe that are in fully exposed
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can still see definitely a little
bit of a stress there, a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: hit to the overall kind of plant
performance there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not what it could have been, but this was
a little further along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully not as great a percentage
reduction, but still not reaching the
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum that could have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a factor of growing outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the challenges associated with
that, where you don't have control over
[SPEAKER_00]: all these different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the advantage is you have a lot less
upfront costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of got to balance that out as
far as maybe not getting the maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of yield here being grown outside,
but also not having all the inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily that would be associated with
an indoor grow.
