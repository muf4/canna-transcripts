[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tobacco University video,
we're going to be investigating fire
[SPEAKER_00]: debris sample collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to enter an area that a
fire had recently occurred, how would you
[SPEAKER_00]: go about collecting samples?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, we want to be looking at,
well, what areas would we want to sample?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to look at the areas that are
likely to contain traces of ignitable
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid, because this can help provide some
valuable information about what may have
[SPEAKER_00]: started or continued that fire from going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Areas you want to look for are like low
regions and burn areas, depressions,
[SPEAKER_00]: insulated areas within a pattern,
poor substances in contact with the
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examples of this could be like articles of
clothing, paper products, or potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: wood in that debris sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also looking at seams or cracks,
it could be in floors or next to walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also important areas to be investigating
for potentially good samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lightly burned edges of the pattern are
good because they're not too far charred
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're not untouched.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of give you that fringe area and
can tell you a lot about the fire there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the fire debris, the evidence you
might be looking for collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paper and trash itself, if you're looking
at the trash can there, typically does not
[SPEAKER_00]: really yield much evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be looking for if there was a
use of an accelerant to aid in a rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was a chemical device used?
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we see the picture above me
here, the flares.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were they the potential start of the fire?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any signs that an electric
device that could purposely delay the
[SPEAKER_00]: initiation of a fire used?
[SPEAKER_00]: Indicating that someone may have been able
to set the stage and then leave and then
[SPEAKER_00]: have the fire occur when they were safely
out of the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, unburned portions of chemical and
electronic devices may be left behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can help again provide some more
evidence leading to telling the story of
[SPEAKER_00]: what happened with this fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're collecting fire debris,
this is important that along with the
[SPEAKER_00]: sample from point of origin, a control
sample should also be collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is material from a different room or
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: It acts as that good source of comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's carpet fibers, for example,
there's synthetics, maybe petroleum based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we should take some charred
remains and also them from another room,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if they're unburned to act as
that comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with transporting our fire debris,
well, we want to transfer the collected
[SPEAKER_00]: samples into a tightly sealed container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, it's a glass jar or a metal
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of want to have that isolated,
want to make sure we're labeling it,
[SPEAKER_00]: ideally putting some evidence tape over
that so we're not having anyone tamper
[SPEAKER_00]: with it and also indicating with an image
and a number where we collected that
[SPEAKER_00]: sample from because it could be very
important later in the investigation
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the role of accelerants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that these aid in the
initial ignition and potential spread
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern of a fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually in debris, make finding it a
challenge because they tend to be dirty or
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, for example, with gasoline
evaporates very quickly, but we could
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially look for if there's evidence
of a poor pattern, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these accelerants can really help
determine that initial ignition point or
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially influence the pattern that
that fire progresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this accelerant sample processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at hopefully
identifying if an accelerant was used,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we do determine that to be the case,
we want to send that to the lab in a
[SPEAKER_00]: clean, vapor-tight container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, paint cans are used,
but not plastic containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could also use a glass jar as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them to be vapor-tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want that accelerant to basically
evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's time from being recovered from
the scene to entering the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of three techniques are typically
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heated headspace gas chromatography,
absorption strip, and solvent wash could
[SPEAKER_00]: help determine what accelerant was
collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind, and remember that during
a fire or explosion investigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want to forget about collecting
other forensics evidence, such as shoe
[SPEAKER_00]: prints in the area, DNA, tool marks,
blood, fingerprints, and a whole host of
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because there's clear evidence of
a fire being present, by all means collect
[SPEAKER_00]: the evidence related to the potential
fire, but also don't forget or don't cross
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminate any other typical evidence
that would be collected at any forensics
[SPEAKER_00]: crime scene.
