[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
we're going to go out in the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're going to show you how to
recognize a nitrogen deficiency in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to correct this nitrogen deficiency,
if you wanted one of the pure nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers, urea, calcium nitrate or
blood meal would be great options.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other videos on that within this
channel as well as how to calculate 100
[SPEAKER_00]: parts per million to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this just shows when you get a little
bit on the skinny side on nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the plant response will be so you can
recognize it quickly and make corrections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so if you're looking at these plants
here, we can notice there is some
[SPEAKER_00]: yellowing of those lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is characteristic of a nitrogen
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see how yellowing those lower
leaves get.
[SPEAKER_00]: The newer upper growth stays green because
nitrogen is a mobile nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at a plant and see
those lower leaves kind of get that yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: to that limey green coloration,
that's a sign we've got a mobile nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those older leaves are sacrificing their
nutrients for the lush newer growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a good sign or an indication we
need to up our nitrogen fertilizer for
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, as we can see here, those lower
leaves get that yellowy to almost brown,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that newer upper growth maintains that
nice lush green growth, which is what we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's simply that nitrogen moving from
the older leaves to that newer leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good indication that nitrogen fertilizer
is a little bit lacking in this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're upping their fertilizer and
that should help correct the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves that are this severe and
yellowing probably will not re green.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those that are more of the limey green
color, compared to the darker green color,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this kind of this type of lighter green
compared to this green, those have a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance at greening up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's saying they will hopefully will
stop the progression of any more yellowing
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout that plant and throughout the
other plants in this entire greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
