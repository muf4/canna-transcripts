[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're gonna look at how your
body goes about regulating blood calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does your body wanna maintain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, normal calcium levels are 10
milligrams per deciliter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's normal calcium levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your body's trying to keep at a very
consistent rate despite a lot of changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does your body regulate this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, if we have an increase in
our calcium level, say plus 10 milligrams,
[SPEAKER_00]: per deciliter, we're gonna get higher than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thyroid is gonna release calcitonin,
which is gonna cause calcium reabsorption
[SPEAKER_00]: in the kidneys to decrease, which is gonna
limit our osteoclast activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this ultimately is gonna lead to the
calcium levels in blood to decrease back
[SPEAKER_00]: down to 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're seeing it above 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing these chaining of events that
occur, reducing the level to then get it
[SPEAKER_00]: back around 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if the opposite occurs, we have a
decrease in calcium level.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parathyroid glands release PTH,
which is a hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will cause osteoclasts to release
calcium from bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium is reabsorbed from the urine by
the kidneys, and calcium absorption in
[SPEAKER_00]: small intestine increases via vitamin D
synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These three events will cause calcium
levels in the blood to increase,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully bringing that level back up to
the 10 milligrams per deciliter that your
[SPEAKER_00]: body needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a general overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna look at this now in a little
bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of putting it all
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see we're trying to maintain
homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a way to increase it,
if calcium levels increase, we wanna lower
[SPEAKER_00]: them, and if they decrease, we wanna raise
them to help maintain homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at this in a little bit more
detail, we have blood calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration dropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of have this kind of situation
that's occurring here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this decrease in calcium level
that's initially occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at this in more detail,
the body still releases PTH, which is that
[SPEAKER_00]: parathyroid gland hormone, and that's
being released into the bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's causing an effect on the bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It inhibits the osteoblast, stimulates the
osteoclast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bone is broken down, releasing calcium
ions into the bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: This same hormone, though, in addition to
the blood, also is affecting the kidneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stimulating the kidneys to recover
waste calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't wanna excrete that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to take that back into the
bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is causing that movement of these
ions to help raise these levels up,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we have this initial drop that
your body's able to sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the bone and the kidneys,
the intestines will also be affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: This PTH hormone will also stimulate the
intestines to absorb calcium from
[SPEAKER_00]: digestible food.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important because your body's
doing whatever it can to help bring these
[SPEAKER_00]: levels up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now calcium levels will begin to increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may cause calcitonin to be released.
[SPEAKER_00]: High concentrations of calcium stimulate
these cells to release calcitonin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcitonin will put calcium into bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we had low levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did these three different events.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've now increased our blood calcium
levels almost too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we need to reabsorb that and store
that calcium in the sense of calcitonin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That then will ultimately release to the
calcitonin in the bone, which will
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulate the osteoblast, inhibit the
osteoclast, and calcium is ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: removed from the blood and used to build
bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can cause the calcium levels to drop,
which will then cause a sequence of events
[SPEAKER_00]: to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want you to understand that it's
very complex in how the body does
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate, in this case just calcium,
but there is always a way to, in this
[SPEAKER_00]: case, raise our calcium levels and
decrease our calcium levels to help
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain that very delicate balance we
call homeostasis.
Thank you.
