[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at
ecological organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that starting at the very
basic or the level of the organism can
[SPEAKER_00]: build up to a population that can lead to
a community, an ecosystem, a landscape,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a global view here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just kind of a general
ecological organization here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to this in a little bit
more detail now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, well, what is ecology?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, evolution and ecology are two key
concepts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that evolution are changes
that occur in an organism's traits over
[SPEAKER_00]: time, over an extended period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecology is how the organism lives in their
particular environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep in mind the separation of
these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: To break apart ecology, that's the focus
of this video lecture, is that ecology
[SPEAKER_00]: stands for house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So house and theology is the study of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think of the study of an organism's
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greatest diversity of life on Earth is
a result of evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And evolution can be said as the
consequences of ecology over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do have an impact and influence on
one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, ecology is the study of how
organisms interact with their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an example, we see the bee interacting
with the flower here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, adaptions to climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many organisms have adapted to survive in
their specific climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here with a camouflage, also the
changing of fur coats of color of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rabbits here.
[SPEAKER_00]: White during the winter months to blend in
with the background and brown here to
[SPEAKER_00]: represent a little bit more of the
forested kind of soil leaf looking
[SPEAKER_00]: material here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six levels of ecological organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of just a general summary
slide, a good one to come back to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to refer to and see if you hit
all the major points because all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: are covered in this particular video
lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Populations, species, communities,
ecosystems, biomes in the biosphere will
[SPEAKER_00]: all be touched on here in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with first populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's a population?
[SPEAKER_00]: Populations are individuals of the same
species living together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The demographics are the statistical study
of populations which allow predictions to
[SPEAKER_00]: be made about how a population will
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at past data,
past influences.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make a prediction, doesn't
necessarily mean that's how it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: turn out, but a prediction on how that
population may change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it can go up and down in
kind of a predicted pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, here we're looking at median
household income, just as an example of
[SPEAKER_00]: how things can fluctuate and change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're tying this in to populations of
species living together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's a species?
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a species living together,
well, how do we define a species?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, species are all populations of a
particular kind of organism from a
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's this kind of mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this assumes there's common
characteristics within a similar species,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically compatible, interbreed under
natural conditions, and sexual
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduction can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannot be with exclusive asexuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't call this asexual organisms,
how they replicate or multiply.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is reproduction in the absence of
fusion of organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So prokaryotes, amoeba, and some animal
plants can reproduce with asexual means.
[SPEAKER_00]: That exactly fits the definition for a
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at different bird
species here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these all have common characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're genetically compatible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can interbreed under natural
conditions and reproduce by the way of
[SPEAKER_00]: sexual reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this species, species is Latin for kind
or appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Linus describes species in terms of
their morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morphology is like the shape or how they
visually look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Modern taxonomists also consider genetic
makeup as a function and behavioral
[SPEAKER_00]: differences when describing the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can be a little bit more precise
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the DNA, see some commonalities
that may exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we can kind of classify or
define species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Communities are populations of different
species living together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the most system to define with
precision a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because communities are macro systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a large system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's held together by feeling and
sentiment at the interface between society
[SPEAKER_00]: and micro systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we say the community could be,
for example, the school community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be the town community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be the state community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be the region community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's difficult to define
with a great deal of precision.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consistent part is populations of
different species living together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a community, populations identify
with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may occupy common territory,
engage in common activities, and have some
[SPEAKER_00]: form of organization that provides a
differential of functions, which allows
[SPEAKER_00]: the community to adapt to its environment,
thereby meeting its needs of its
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the meerkats can have a lookout.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a local community here engaging in
activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: This interaction between different species
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, within these communities,
components include the persons,
[SPEAKER_00]: groups, or families and organizations
within its population and the institutions
[SPEAKER_00]: it forms to meet its needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here where we see people coming
together, a community coming together to
[SPEAKER_00]: build up bikes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a community coming together here to
distribute food or water during a time of
[SPEAKER_00]: crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are, again, are each communities,
but they are defined slightly differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now ecosystems looking a little bit larger
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a combination of communities and
associated non-living factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an ecosystem is a natural unit
consisting of all plants, animals,
[SPEAKER_00]: and micro-organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also including the biotic factors in an
area functioning together with their
[SPEAKER_00]: non-living physical or abiotic factors in
the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is defining an ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a highway that's passing
through, and we have an animal crossing
[SPEAKER_00]: passage here to eliminate the need for
them to kind of go through the road
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, again, kind of a small
version, kind of an ecosystem because
[SPEAKER_00]: we're taking into account biotic factors,
the animals, and abiotic factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which can be just a physical outline of
the land there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, we have something called
biomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biomes are major terrestrial areas of
organisms that occur over wide geographic
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So biomes are very large scale based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Location of each biome is primarily
defined by the temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation an area may receive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biomes can also be defined by winds,
rapid temperature changes, fires,
[SPEAKER_00]: floods, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you just a little bit of an
idea of classification of some biomes
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're listed here, but the key part here
is that it's major terrestrial areas
[SPEAKER_00]: located within the geographic range of the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how we kind of link all this together
is the biosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the largest scale that we're
going to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: This includes all the biomes together with
marine and freshwater areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Earth has four major connected
systems, the hydrosphere, the lithosphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: the atmosphere, and the ecosphere all
together creating the biosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is the portion of the Earth that's
inhabited by life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Includes all the biotic and also nonliving
components or abiotic parts here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of ties everything together
looking at the very large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back to our first slide where we see
that's the global view.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we worked our way all the way down
from kind of that organism level of the
[SPEAKER_00]: population defining communities that are
interacting to form ecosystems and the
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape forming our entire ecological
organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
