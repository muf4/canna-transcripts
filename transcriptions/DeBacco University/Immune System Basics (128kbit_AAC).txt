[SPEAKER_00]: As the title suggests, this is going to go
over the immune system basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The graph here kind of gives you the very
brief overview where we have an initial
[SPEAKER_00]: response, protective immunity,
and memory that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that memory can occur over
years, and this is what makes vaccines
[SPEAKER_00]: effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our initial exposure will have a dramatic
rise in antibody or effector T cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also provided links here to two other
YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll also find the links to the slides
and references in the description below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first off, the immune system in
general, looking at the human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: The human body is a wonderful place
because it's safe, it's nutrient-rich,
[SPEAKER_00]: and its temperature and pH are optimized.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the effect that your body is able
to maintain homeostasis to keep the cells
[SPEAKER_00]: nice and protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is quite attractive to other
organisms that don't belong in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are conditions which are very
difficult to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, we have those organisms that
want to get into the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these provide value and may help
maintain the environment by breaking down
[SPEAKER_00]: macromolecules that we can't, such as an
example of some enzymes, synthesizing
[SPEAKER_00]: needed nutrients, and keeping harmful
organisms in check.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, not every organism is out to
benefit the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some bad apples, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: These bad apples want to essentially
compete for nutrients, overload the system
[SPEAKER_00]: with toxins, take over and destroy cell
machinery, and kill body cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, we can have that sick
feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are disease-causing organisms that
our body must defend against physically,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as, for example, be our skin,
and with biological means, such as white
[SPEAKER_00]: blood cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The supporting infrastructure to the
immune system is something called the
[SPEAKER_00]: lymphatic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to only touch on that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to bring that more in when we do
circulatory system because, as you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: here, it is closely related.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the lymphatic system is a central
location for storage and distribution of
[SPEAKER_00]: immune cells and proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're sick, someone might say,
oh, my lymph nodes are swollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a network of capillaries,
ducts, and nodes throughout our organ
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that here, how it does look
very similar to our circulatory system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a pathogen is a microorganism that
can cause disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some examples of some pathogens
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are viruses, bacteria, fungi,
parasites, but it's important that can
[SPEAKER_00]: cause disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pathogen is only one-third of the
necessary components to cause disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a pathogen that needs the proper
host and needs the proper environment to
[SPEAKER_00]: result in disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often give the examples, and sort of
focusing on humans here, certain pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: that may affect plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tobacco mosaic virus, powdery mildew,
are a pathogen that affect plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they need the proper host and
environment to cause disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pathogen exists in the air,
particularly powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've breathed those spores in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not the proper host, so therefore,
disease is not caused.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need all three of these factors to
come into play at the same time to result
[SPEAKER_00]: in a disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the enemy look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is our immune system protecting us
against?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a wide range of organisms
that try to exploit our bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a few examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind there's cellular enemies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's parasites and fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also acellular or non-living ones,
such as a virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, a virus is a DNA or RNA wrapped
in a protein coat, and we have our
[SPEAKER_00]: prokaryotes would be, for example,
our bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these can do our body harm as a
result in the immune system to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: handle all of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have different blood cell types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So RBC, again, stands for red blood cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we refer to them as erythrocytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an example of them transporting
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did hypotonic, isotonic, and hypertonic
situations here, how they can swell up and
[SPEAKER_00]: then travel, and then white blood cells,
WBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called leukocytes, and as we can
see here, there's many different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: white blood cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one type of red blood cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red blood cells have those biconcave
discs, which are important for increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface area to volume ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elements of blood, so red blood cells,
white blood cells are going to be our main
[SPEAKER_00]: focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to forget about we also
have platelets in our blood, which we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about when we do the circulatory
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: White blood cells are probably the most
important part of the immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here a large table kind of
discussing them and see their importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our erythrocytes, and here's our
platelets there, and you can pause the
[SPEAKER_00]: video and take a look at those in greater
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to focus mainly with the
immune system, the white blood cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of those white blood cells,
this is a great summary chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've watched some of the other immune
system videos to come back to this,
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of prevents it a nice cell type,
characteristics, location, and in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: image.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are our four main types here,
and on the last slide here, we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: other four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, good slides to come back to,
use as review to make sure you're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify some of the different white blood
cell types of the immune system.
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
