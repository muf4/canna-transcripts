[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tobacco University video we're
going to go over cannabis edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into some of the understanding
of just what cannabis edibles actually
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the products mentioned here are
derived from C.T.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharma and the reason why they were chosen
is they offer a lot of publicly available
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical reports that they produce and
you can go through and access those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in this video the descriptions
opinions and uses are intended to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: an understanding of some of the end
products of the cannabis plant and those
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical reports will be provided at the
end and they're often a missed component
[SPEAKER_00]: that should accompany any product someone
is interested in purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into the description of
edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they are either ready to be eaten or
ready to be infused food items with
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana or a cannabis plant and result.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have multiple different dosage and a
multitude of different food variations and
[SPEAKER_00]: because of this it is kind of a word of
caution if you're going to be looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles to make sure you definitely have
them distinctly isolated and kept only for
[SPEAKER_00]: adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want these to fall into the
hands of children.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be very easy for that to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the options of edibles we could see
very common products, honey, infused
[SPEAKER_00]: baking mix, drink mix, olive oil,
different dosage associated with these,
[SPEAKER_00]: strength usually low to medium for the
most part and again if you've watched
[SPEAKER_00]: other videos you see some have high
strength, some have medium strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tend to be low to medium but keep in
mind that we do want to be protective of
[SPEAKER_00]: these items, labeling them, sectioning
them so they are different, making sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that kids don't come in contact with these
particular edible options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the use of edibles, they can be
consumed early for strong medical effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will set in about 45 minutes to an hour
after consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an important note to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not an immediate effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a delay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to be mindful of the
dosage that you're incurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be taking one dose and then
immediately 10 minutes later taking
[SPEAKER_00]: another and another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is that delayed effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Infused olive oil and baking mix can be
added directly to any sort of baking
[SPEAKER_00]: recipe or cooking choice to properly
infuse with active, in this case THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again we want to be mindful in keeping
them away from children.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned at the beginning,
those importance of the certificate of
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis and yes many people will probably
be looking at the cannabinoid profiles or
[SPEAKER_00]: the terpenes and that's well and good but
we want to be mindful also of looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the other things such as
microbiology, microtoxins, heavy metal and
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides, making sure we're passing all
of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see here the detection levels
for different pesticides, making sure
[SPEAKER_00]: we're passing all of those as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times these numbers will come
present on the label which is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: thing as we can see on all of these
labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also your right as a consumer to
make sure the lot numbers are matching up
[SPEAKER_00]: to those original analytical reports so
that you're an informed consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
