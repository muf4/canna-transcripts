[SPEAKER_00]: This DeBaco University video is going to
go over recognizing some of the visual
[SPEAKER_00]: cues of the flower size and development of
your cannabis bud or flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into recognizing the
visual cues of cannabis plants flower size
[SPEAKER_00]: and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, when we're talking about
cannabis flowers, remember that while
[SPEAKER_00]: large and dense buds are desirable,
this is not like growing a zucchini.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let it grow longer, it will not
simply just get bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your goal is to maximize not necessarily
the size, but the chemical compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though when we get into this
increased density that we see here,
[SPEAKER_00]: this can be dense, this can increase the
total amount of chemicals that's being
[SPEAKER_00]: produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because these are very similar in
physical size, this one is much less
[SPEAKER_00]: dense, so it will not have as much
chemical compounds gram for gram,
[SPEAKER_00]: ounce for ounce as this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just keep that in mind that
bigger is not always better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bigger and denser with those higher
chemical profiles is how chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: percentages is really what's deemed to be
desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flower bud and size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, typically the buds exposed to the
most light will become the largest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are typically the apical buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're typically the top buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why so many pruning strategies,
particularly for indoor growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: have this as a main goal to kind of
organize and orient their buds so that as
[SPEAKER_00]: many are pointing upwards towards that
maximum light as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that different pruning strategy,
with that idea, that time and labor,
[SPEAKER_00]: the advantage is you'll get more of the
larger buds and less of the smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary or sometimes called popcorn buds
that simply are not going to produce as
[SPEAKER_00]: much per flower of the chemicals that
these will produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at compounds versus size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind if the goal is internal
compounds, why is size even a
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the large size is desirable and
demonstrates good growing practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these typically get the top dollar as
these are the most sought after.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you're looking to try to
sample a different variety, consider
[SPEAKER_00]: second cut flower as these have similar
chemical properties and profiles,
[SPEAKER_00]: but due to reduced size, they come at a
cost savings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get a better dollar,
better return on investment if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: those larger, denser buds, even though
really we're looking at kind of what is in
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but it was chemically what is in
that bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: But something about this, just those large
buds shows that that grower probably has a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of growing practices,
able to maximize that yield, maximize the
[SPEAKER_00]: size and density typically will also mean
to maximizing the compounds present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why those get top dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't discount the smaller secondary
cut buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at a new variety or
something a little different, those can
[SPEAKER_00]: have very similar profiles at a reduced
cost to try something else out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then potentially if you like that,
there are those larger, more denser
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, those higher premium flowers
that you can progress to just as another
[SPEAKER_00]: option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
