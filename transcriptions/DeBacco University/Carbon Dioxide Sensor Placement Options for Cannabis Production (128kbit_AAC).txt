[SPEAKER_00]: So in this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to go over proper placement of
[SPEAKER_00]: your carbon dioxide sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over carbon dioxide
sensor placement options for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, keep in mind that sensors
need or should be calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow factory instructions, but often
this means allowing it to sit outside away
[SPEAKER_00]: from carbon dioxide sources to establish
foreign parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, you yourself are a
carbon dioxide source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note this is important to keep away from
cars, people, animals, grills,
[SPEAKER_00]: or anything that may produce carbon
dioxide away from the sensor while it is
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The calibration process can take about 15
minutes, but once it is set, you will not
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be, the sensor will not have to be
recalibrated for a year or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep it definitely in the ISO location
for at least that 15 minute period.
[SPEAKER_00]: A sensor's reading is only as good as its
placement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where you place your sensor depends on
many factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to take these into consideration
so that an accurate reading can be
[SPEAKER_00]: obtained.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goals provide an accurate reading so
the plant's potential yield can be
[SPEAKER_00]: maximized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also be mindful of the temperature the
sensor is exposed to as this could alter
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential readings as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now adjustable sensor placement can
sometimes be a good idea, particularly for
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor growing operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is depending on the exact growing
space, the sensor may need to be adjusted
[SPEAKER_00]: as the plant grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to keep several factors in mind to
ensure consistent and accurate readings,
[SPEAKER_00]: even as the plants might be changing as
they age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality sensors should have a photo cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something you definitely want
to be looking out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dosing of carbon dioxide should only be
during the light periods, since this is
[SPEAKER_00]: when the plants are actively using carbon
dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding carbon dioxide at night or during a
lights off period of the day was,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be not beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that photo sensor the goal is to only
have it go through the process when
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a sufficient light for this
synthetic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the nighttime or lights off,
the sensor should essentially stop dosing
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with any sensor, be careful,
there's usually a sulfur vaporizer
[SPEAKER_00]: warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is stated here as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always want to read the complete
instructions with your unit before using
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are using a sulfur vaporizer,
just keep that in mind that in this
[SPEAKER_00]: example, the Atlas 8, they state clearly,
and they put it in red, that if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using a sulfur vaporizer, this will
basically avoid the warranty and damage
[SPEAKER_00]: the infrared CO2 sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using a sulfur vaporizer,
do not have your CO2 sensor in the room at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally there's three sensor
placements to be considering.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's above the plant, there's midway up
the plant, and there's towards the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find those usually above plant height,
at plant height and below plant height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that the injection method can also
influence the placement, but in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: assuming even carbon dioxide distribution,
where would you place your sensor?
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind that CO2 is heavier than
normal atmospheric air, which is composed
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you put the sensor placement below
plant height, the advantage is,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you put it down here, ensures the
maximum concentration of CO2 is getting to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, may cause an increase in usage,
especially if there's an exhaust or carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: filter setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep this in mind that if you're
placing your sensor below plant height,
[SPEAKER_00]: because carbon dioxide will naturally fall
down, you're ensuring that you get the
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum concentration that gets to the
plant, but it may cause increase in usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what if you put it at the plant height?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the advantage is this provides an
average reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is it may be below the
injection point, will provide an higher
[SPEAKER_00]: than actual reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind where this might be in
relation to your dosing or addition of
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide to the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, if you choose to put it above
plant height, the advantages will be the
[SPEAKER_00]: least impacted by exhaust or ventilation
systems, but it can cause a higher reading
[SPEAKER_00]: since carbon dioxide is heavier than the
air as a disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So evaluate these positions, the plants
look at the growing area and make a
[SPEAKER_00]: decision on where you would place your
sensor.
