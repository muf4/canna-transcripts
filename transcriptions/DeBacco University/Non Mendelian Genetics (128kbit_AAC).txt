[SPEAKER_00]: So in this video lecture, I'm going to
cover non-Mendelian genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are genetics that don't follow
Gregor Mendel's theories and patterns and
[SPEAKER_00]: laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a little special case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go over some of these specialties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some traits don't show Mendelian
inheritance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are following, quote, different
rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendelian segregation of alleles can be
disguised by a variety of factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a couple here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to kind of mention a few of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incomplete dominance, co-dominance,
sex-linked factors, environmental effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of things that are going
to cause genes not to be as simple as we
[SPEAKER_00]: saw with Gregor Mendel and his pea plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the first one here,
incomplete dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of a good one to kind of
go through and review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither allele is completely dominant over
the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we have a big R representing
red petals and little r representing white
petals.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we cross these two together,
red isn't dominant over white,
[SPEAKER_00]: white's not dominant over red.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a blending.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heterozygote individuals, the big R,
little r's, have a phenotype that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: blending of the two alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, pink.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a red with a white producing
heterozygotes would be pink, pinkish
[SPEAKER_00]: purple in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just kind of showing incomplete
dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: One isn't dominant over the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incomplete to kind of get this
blending, causing the heterozygotes to
[SPEAKER_00]: have their own look or phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have something called
co-dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as this name implies, two equally
dominant alleles are expressed at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heterozygotes phenotype will have both
phenotypes visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certain genes, an example with
hemoglobin is made from a recessive
[SPEAKER_00]: alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sickling genes, a sickle cell
anemia, where we're getting both the
[SPEAKER_00]: normal hemoglobin and the sickle trait
also being observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe something easier to kind of visually
picture with co-dominance is if we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: white cow, we have a brown cow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're exhibiting co-dominance,
we're getting a white cow with brown spots
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting that co-dominance, we're seeing
the white and the brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike our previous example here,
look at incomplete dominance, we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: blending.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a blending here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an expression of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the sickle cell trait,
we have the sickle cell gene with also the
[SPEAKER_00]: normal red blood cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at that sickle cell example
here, the normal gene and sickle cell
[SPEAKER_00]: gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in this case, we have two carriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a child that does not have sickle
cell anemia, two normal copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a carrier for sickle cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does have the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with this offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sadly, this offspring has both copies
of sickle cell and probably will not
[SPEAKER_00]: survive without any intervention into
reproductive age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of following a
genotype in inheritance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great kind of combination
picture of co-dominance and incomplete
[SPEAKER_00]: dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have co-dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the red and the white both being
expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have incomplete dominance over here
where we have kind of that red and white
[SPEAKER_00]: blending together to make that pink.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be mindful of comparing and contrasting
the difference of co-dominance and
[SPEAKER_00]: incomplete dominance, both of which are
examples of non-Mendelian genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this polygenic inheritance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is very important when we're
looking at blood type, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're looking at blood type,
what can be important when we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at blood type is that there is this
polygenic genes that exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more than two alternate alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: ABO blood grouping is an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, we have possible alleles
from the female parent from mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have A blood type, B blood type,
or in this case, this would be O blood
[SPEAKER_00]: type.
[SPEAKER_00]: A and B can be co-dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're expressed, if they're present,
and I is the recessive, that's what we
[SPEAKER_00]: call that O blood type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the possible alleles from
mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the possible alleles from dad,
A, B, or in this case, I, which would be
[SPEAKER_00]: standing for O blood type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we kind of cross these together and
we have slightly different colorations
[SPEAKER_00]: here, now making it a little easier to
follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have an A and A, this would be A
blood type.
[SPEAKER_00]: A crossed with B here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're polygenic, we're having that
A, B blood type.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having both being expressed in this
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're having A blood type because O
doesn't really have a marker to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that I is representing that recessive
trait there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would just be considered A blood
type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A and a B means AB blood type.
[SPEAKER_00]: B and a B means it's B blood type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the B and the recessive I would just
be B blood type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see the same thing follows
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way to get true O blood type
is to have both recessive alleles present
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can hopefully see a little color
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as kind of that kind of mixture of
the two on how if you have that recessive,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of non antigen expression,
and you have that B blood type,
[SPEAKER_00]: that will be just B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're B and B, or B in that kind
of quote O, you'd have B blood type.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of shows again, those alleles
gives you a little picture here of A blood
[SPEAKER_00]: type and B blood type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And A and B could see both of those being
expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that O group really has no antigens or
expression on that outer cell of the
rectum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a red blood cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Antibodies present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have A blood type, you're going
to be anti-B.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a foreign antigen to you because
you're going to have the A antigen
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important that AB has no antibodies
because if they had anti-A or B,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they express both of those on
their red blood cells, it'd essentially be
[SPEAKER_00]: having a reaction that would occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important if you're donating blood
or receiving blood that you get one from
[SPEAKER_00]: the similar or compatible group type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lastly here, these polygenic
inheritance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as we said, it's not as simple as we
saw Gregor Mandel and his pea plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This polygenic inheritance involves
multiple genes and a spectrum of results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example here I gave is skin color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also true for eye color, height,
and a whole host of other genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on several different gene
pairs, different loci in tandem,
[SPEAKER_00]: alleles for dark skin or incomplete
balance for those for light.
[SPEAKER_00]: First generation of offspring each have
three units of darkness and intermediate
[SPEAKER_00]: pigment representation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have that regression to the mean
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some very light skinned here and a very
dark skinned here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see how those gametes are
coming together because we have this F1
[SPEAKER_00]: generation where we have someone that's
way at the kind of zero end of the skin
[SPEAKER_00]: pigment color and someone that's very dark
at the other end with first generations
[SPEAKER_00]: right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we could see that their offspring
can have the whole kind of gamete here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority will fit in kind of that two
to four skin color type.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could see that there's a pencil
for a six and a zero as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that second generation of offspring
have a wide variation in pigments because
[SPEAKER_00]: of this kind of mixing of genes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that provides a little bit of
a background here looking at genes and
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at these genes that don't follow
Gregor Mandel's set laws.
