[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this tobacco university video,
where if you're considering adding carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide to your cannabis production,
this will go over the basics to help you
[SPEAKER_00]: make an informed decision and things to
look out for if you are considering this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at carbon dioxide
basics for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting first, you have to understand
that cannabis specifically is what's
[SPEAKER_00]: called a C3 plant, similar in structure
for its photosynthetic process as tomatoes
[SPEAKER_00]: would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other types are called C4 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They include corn and sugar cane,
and cam plants are cacti.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's different processes
that they go through as they prepare
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide for the Kelvin cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: C3 plants is basically a direct
incorporation of carbon dioxide to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelvin cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind with carbon dioxide,
it's heavier than air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dryest to add carbon dioxide,
as you can see here, put it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: suspended kind of container here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is not advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that the carbon dioxide,
in this case, dry ice, is kind of going
[SPEAKER_00]: from the solid state to the gaseous state,
and here it's falling through the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is not going to really create
anything that's going to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent or really meet the plant's
needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we'll add carbon dioxide,
but it will not add it in a consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the environmental factors you want to
consider with a plant in general is that
[SPEAKER_00]: light intensity, the amount of carbon
dioxide in the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind as the light intensity
increases, there'll be a certain plateau.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same goes with the amount of carbon
dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can increase the concentration of
carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will increase the rate of
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then temperature, there will be a rise
in ideal or optimum temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a falling off from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to keep in mind all these
factors that your plant is growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to focus, of course,
here on the carbon dioxide aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important input to the photosynthetic
equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can see here, carbon dioxide plus
water plus sunlight will produce sugar and
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the carbon that forms in the sugar
end product here originated as carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide molecule in the air, and that's
why there's six of them here, because we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to make a six carbon sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So low carbon dioxide equals low growth
rate, and these little brackets mean
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at a lettuce study,
notice that the changes in drying mass or
[SPEAKER_00]: yield at different light intensities
across the range of CO2 concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our CO2 concentration,
and we can see here different light
[SPEAKER_00]: intensities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can make the conclusion here that
increasing the light intensity,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what the concentration of carbon
dioxide will increase yields, at least
[SPEAKER_00]: provided in this study here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can see also the trend that as you
increase carbon dioxide concentration from
[SPEAKER_00]: ambient, it's going to be around 400,
somewhere around this range right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that there is an increase
overall in the dry mass or yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this reference article that I've
included here, this is looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic response of cannabis in
relation to variations in photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: photon flux densities, temperature,
and for this video, carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, which you're welcome to check
this out for more details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now net photosynthesis in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at specifically
cannabis, the optimum temperature for
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis is around 30 degrees
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature higher than 30 degrees has
adverse effects on the photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually starts to curl over and start
to degrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're looking at,
the light intensity measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this trend was peaked at about 1500
micromoles of PPFD, which is the light
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity at 30 degrees Celsius,
and decreased at higher light intensities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this means as you increase light
intensities, there's kind of this optimum
[SPEAKER_00]: here, which is an intensity and
temperature, and more is not always
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the optimum temperature is
around 30 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 1500 micromoles for light intensity
should be around your target levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now carbon dioxide levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, PN is net photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this column here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And WEE is water use efficiency on the
leaves of cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the carbon dioxide levels here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that there's a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see there's also alterations in
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as we're looking at what has the
highest net photosynthesis, what we can
[SPEAKER_00]: see here, 750 micromoles of concentration
of carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as a reminder, around 400 is what
would be considered atmospheric levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now again, comparing here to our light
levels, notice how at high light levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: plants can be better, can better utilize
the added carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If adding carbon dioxide, make sure plants
are not light limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just adding more carbon dioxide is
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we could see here is that ambient
level here with low light, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could add a lot of carbon dioxide and
really not get any more kind of increase
[SPEAKER_00]: in the rate of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that these, all of these,
even the highlight level does have a sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of plateau to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this should be, the light intensity
should be measured with a PAR meter to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure that adding carbon dioxide will
actually be utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are your light levels at?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just example of this study
showing what's considered low,
[SPEAKER_00]: medium, and high light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now concerns about carbon dioxide from a
grower standpoint, keep in mind that
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations above 5,000 can be harmful
to humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're looking at enriching an
area with carbon dioxide for plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking really not going much more
than a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is not necessarily going to cause
any sort of harmful effects or hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: any of the conditions labeled here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the volume of the air,
really not getting into any of that here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the levels that would be acceptable for
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do you estimate your carbon
dioxide usage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you want to know how much
you're going to use, just providing a
[SPEAKER_00]: random example here for an area,
looking at a 32 foot by 40 foot high
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnel that was 32 foot wide, 40 feet
long, and 12 feet at the peak,
[SPEAKER_00]: operating at about a thousand parts per
million of carbon dioxide with the system
[SPEAKER_00]: turned off during venting periods of high
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It uses 50 pounds of CO2 per week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is intended to simply be a
rough estimate, looking at if you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide from compressed air
bottles, you can expect if you have this
[SPEAKER_00]: area to go through about one 50 pound
bottle a week, plus or minus from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a rough idea there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when should carbon dioxide be added?
[SPEAKER_00]: In short, from emergence to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say, oh, I want to save it for the
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do it at the beginning,
really for the entire life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be definitely utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if it's not possible that for the
entire life cycle, then it actually may be
[SPEAKER_00]: more critical in the early stages to get
the plants established early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sealing phases is great time because often
plants might be slow to get going,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the carbon dioxide can help increase
root mass, which of course is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important, especially in the early stages
of plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, autoflowers and carbon dioxide,
all strains will benefit from the adding
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide, but it's highly
recommended for autoflowers because there
[SPEAKER_00]: is a set number of days between when they
emerge and when they will be harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers should be seeking every possible
way to maximize each day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And carbon dioxide enrichment allows for
higher light intensities to be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, assuming all other factors are not
limiting, which will result in a greater
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass production.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will translate into higher yields on
a plant that only has a set number of days
[SPEAKER_00]: to complete its life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking at, well,
I want to try it, try it with autoflowers
[SPEAKER_00]: because they have a set number of days,
you want to maximize each and every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will carbon dioxide increase plant
production?
[SPEAKER_00]: I say yes, but, or yes, if there are no
other limiting factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are receiving optimum
light, optimum nutrients, water,
[SPEAKER_00]: aeration, then carbon dioxide can be used
to boost your plants in need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that with the addition of
carbon dioxide, the plants will be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: take advantage of greater light
intensities and will likely require more
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients to meet the increased growth
rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've been growing a plant or a
certain type of plant for an extended
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time and feel you have
everything dialed in, and now you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: go through and add carbon dioxide,
some of those things may change.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, watering frequencies or
nutrient consumption might be higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have records you should be keeping,
compare those records, but realize carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide may speed things up, but a lot of
times growers can utilize that to their advantage.
