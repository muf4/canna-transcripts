[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this tobacco university video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll be presenting the advantages
and disadvantages of some water sources if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into water sources
for outdoor chemist production,
[SPEAKER_00]: providing with some examples and some
advantages and disadvantages of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, water sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to chemist plants,
they do need water.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to supplying them with water
from sources other than natural rain,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers need to know how to maximize their
plant's performance with the water they
[SPEAKER_00]: have available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many times growers may have different
water source options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which one is, quote, the best or which
one should they choose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to provide you with some advantages
and disadvantages of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, pond water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're looking at we have an
irrigation pond, the advantages of
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigating from pond water is that it's
typically available in large quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we have to remember we're going to
need the water to irrigate the plants the
[SPEAKER_00]: most during times of drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages are that it
does typically need a multi-filter system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just throw a pump in here and
pump out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, you typically need some
sort of multi-filter system to either take
[SPEAKER_00]: particulate out or to ensure you're not
going to be spreading any of the algae
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially that may be growing in that
water as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to city water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the advantages of city water is that,
or tap water may be called also,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that it's easy to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it typically requires minimum
modifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can literally just hook a hose up,
go irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shouldn't be a problem there.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, one of the disadvantages of using
city or tap water is that it can be costly
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to other sources mentioned here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And limited areas have this as an option,
particularly if you're in distant areas or
[SPEAKER_00]: they may not be able to supply enough
water or at least justify the cost for the
[SPEAKER_00]: volume of water that you may need to water
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is also well water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So well water is supply plants in very
remote locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you can potentially have a
well dug or basically bored down and
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigate water that might irrigate with
water at a location that might be very
[SPEAKER_00]: distant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also called a free water source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put free in quotes there simply
because there is some costs associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with the well itself, digging the well,
maybe running power to the well,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting that set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as the cost of the water
itself, in this case, it's basically free.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage of using well water is
you have to be careful in dry years,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how deep that well is and
what its replenish rate may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep in mind that the water that
you're getting pumping up from the well is
[SPEAKER_00]: often a cold temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this might slow down growth of plants
because they typically like warmer water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to check also the quality of your
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with well water in particular,
you want to check the temperature to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure it's not too cold, especially in the
early part of germination and propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't stunt the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this was a nice little review
of looking at the different options that
[SPEAKER_00]: you might have for outdoor irrigation.
