[SPEAKER_00]: Now here we're going to look at drip
irrigation and injector options for
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of a field that I
set up here with drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about 10,000 square feet and this
is a mini dose which is a fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: injector with a filter here allowing me to
fritigate this entire area if I choose to
[SPEAKER_00]: do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the drip irrigation and injector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the drip tapes allow for efficient
watering and low evaporation percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly because it's coming in direct
contact with the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The injector allows for precise nutrient
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here another example here we're
having the bucket where the concentrated
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer would be added and as the water
passes through it will then be added with
[SPEAKER_00]: a very precise amount that can be
calculated of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now drip tapes come in different
thicknesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are standardized your rows the
thicker can be more cost-effective because
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use it over multiple years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six mil is considered one season use and
that's typically used under plastic mulch
[SPEAKER_00]: and has minimum insect resistance as it
can break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight mil is commonly used for vegetable
crops and that's also commonly used for
[SPEAKER_00]: one season but it's a little bit thicker
just a little bit tougher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten mil is used in heavy rocky areas where
crops can overwinter to strawberries and
[SPEAKER_00]: the 15 mil will give you multi-year use
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now drip tapes have different flow rates
and in meter spacings that allow you to
[SPEAKER_00]: customize it for your application.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can determine the feet of tape you
can run at once or you can adjust the
[SPEAKER_00]: tapes and flow rate to match your gallons
per minute of the equipment you're allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: to supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have a large pump that can
supply a lot of water very quickly or do
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a lower flow pump that you need
to apply it in a more gentle sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pause the video here to look at
some of the details but what this
[SPEAKER_00]: basically comes down to is this gives you
the situations I'm assuming a 12 inch
[SPEAKER_00]: emitter spacing per 100 feet at 8 psi
looking at 7 gallons per minute that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what the pump can supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to add about 400 gallons of water
in about 1,500 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's two examples of drip tape
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one flows at 13 gallons per hour per
100 feet and this one flows quicker at 27
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons per hour per 100 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it comes down to is in order to
deliver that same 400 gallons of water
[SPEAKER_00]: this example drip tape running 1,500 feet
we need to run for two hours and this drip
[SPEAKER_00]: tape flowing at a quicker rate would only
need to run for one hour to get the same
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes a little bit of math kind of
going through and figuring it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that complicated but this would
be a good thing just to kind of go over
[SPEAKER_00]: and determine what constraints you have
for your particular system because that
[SPEAKER_00]: can impact what drip tape and flow rate
you would purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the injector allows for the precise
amount of liquid fertilizer to be added at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time as irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to irrigate anyway you
might as well go through and have the
[SPEAKER_00]: option to add some fertilizer to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dosatron is a name brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use MiniDos.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Dosmatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other different types of
injectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dosatron though is used a lot in
greenhouses and that term you might have
[SPEAKER_00]: heard before.
[SPEAKER_00]: The injector can be used as needed and
moved to other zones in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be put on a cart here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can provide a quick fix especially for
growing potted plants or even row crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a good way to supplement in
fertilizer when you're going to naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigate anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly there's something called a Massey
injector which is a less expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative to the Dosatron or Dosmatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no moving parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works with the Venturi effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you remember carburetors it works on
the same principle where we have this
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a squeeze here and
restriction in flow increasing the speed
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing the water to be sucked up through
the pipe here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do lose pressure with this so that is
one drawback to it but there's no moving
[SPEAKER_00]: parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very simple, easy to put in and just
something else to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way to be able to refertigate for
your crops.
Thank you.
