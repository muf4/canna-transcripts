[SPEAKER_00]: As the title suggests, we're going to be
investigating the stomach in a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more detail in this video lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the stomach and its gastric glands
we're going to focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stomach is a sac-like portion of the
tract and it's convoluted surface enabling
[SPEAKER_00]: expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get larger and smaller and adjust
to the contents that it may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs an extra layer of smooth muscle
for mixing food with gastric juices.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't just hold it, it's a sac that
can kind of move and mix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has two kinds of cells, parietal cells
which are the cells that are secreting
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrochloric acid and chief cells which
are secreting pepsinogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that examples here, our parietal
cells and our chief cells both secreting
[SPEAKER_00]: their respective substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very important for our digestive
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the zoomed in portion here,
notice that the stomach as we look at it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the interior layer here, it's one of these
deep pits areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well this is where these secretions are
occurring and they're ultimately coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's important during the
mixing process not only to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen out but
to allow that food to have some form of
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanical digestion as well as this
chemical digestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the human stomach produces about two
liters of hydrochloric acid in other
[SPEAKER_00]: gastric secretions every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a staggering amount when
you think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gastric juice has a pH of
approximately two so it's very acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pH kills most bacteria ingested with
the food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also denatures food proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good thing because we want to
start to break them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mixture of partially digested food and
gastric juice is called chyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember in our mouth when we start
adding saliva, that'd be called the bolus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now when we're mixing these gastric
juices, it now becomes chyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chyme leaves the stomach and the small
intestine through the pyloric sphincter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember sphincters can open and close and
that's what's allowing a portion of this
[SPEAKER_00]: food hopefully after it's been at least
partially digested to start entering the
[SPEAKER_00]: small intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind it goes from esophagus to
stomach to small intestine, not the large
[SPEAKER_00]: intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our gastric anatomy in general,
it's storing ingested food, mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdown of ingested food, disruption of
chemical bonds, these very harsh acidic
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and also the enzymes that it
produces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Production of intrinsic factor in this
glycoprotein is required for absorption of
[SPEAKER_00]: vitamin B12 in the small intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only is it performing some
breakdowns, it's also setting up the
[SPEAKER_00]: ingested food items for the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stomach performs preliminary digestion
of proteins by pepsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some digestion of carbohydrates by
salivary amylase and lipids by the lingual
[SPEAKER_00]: lipase is occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's important about the stomach is that
it becomes more fluid and around about two
[SPEAKER_00]: liters a day of just hydrochloric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a low pH around two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pepsin activity increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we may think of enzymes always working
at a neutral pH and that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pepsinogen actually has improved activity
at a more acidic range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protein disassembly is starting to begin
here and although digestion occurs in the
[SPEAKER_00]: stomach, nutrients are not absorbed and
that's a very important point to make
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is purely digestion, both chemical
and mechanical, but we have not absorbed
[SPEAKER_00]: anything yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both acid and had form of hydrochloric and
pepsin in the form of enzymes and gastric
[SPEAKER_00]: juices and our muscular contractions also
occurring in the stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Important for the digestion process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Digestion is different than absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ulcers, too much acid or bacteria,
this is kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hormone gastrin regulates the
synthesis of hydrochloric acid and
[SPEAKER_00]: increases our enzyme production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overproduction of gastric acid can
occasionally eat a hole through the
[SPEAKER_00]: stomach wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a gastric ulcer.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are actually quite rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, what's been shown is there's
actually this bacteria that will infect
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell walls and that can cause ulcers
to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 90% of the gastrointestinal ulcers
are duodenal ulcers and that's our small
[SPEAKER_00]: intestine there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's caused by too much chyme in the small
intestine, too much of that acid escaping
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the stomach and going into the
small intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, here, this bacteria here is
entering and breaking down the mucous cell
[SPEAKER_00]: wall and getting ultimately to those
layers of the epithelial tissue and that
[SPEAKER_00]: break in that kind of barrier here is
leading to that ulcer, that burning that
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually ulcers in the stomach,
while originally thought to be solely
[SPEAKER_00]: caused by high acid production of
hydrochloric acid in particular,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's actually been related in many cases
to the presence of this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria that's causing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: H.
[SPEAKER_00]: pylori is causing this kind of eating away
of that protective layer causing ulcers to
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, it would be better to
take an antibiotic than an antacid to help
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the presence of these ulcers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, heartburn or acid reflux,
what's occurring here, this strong acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: this burning feeling in the chest caused
by the acid coming up the esophagus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is typically due to a faulty
esophageal sphincter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here that acid's able to sneak its
way up causing that burning sensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This occurs especially when you're lying
down or when you lay on your right side.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's more important on the
right side is that's kind of the way the
[SPEAKER_00]: stomach's oriented and it's easier for
those gastric hydrochloric acids and acids
[SPEAKER_00]: in the stomach to kind of leak out that
esophageal sphincter if it isn't faulty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's more important on the
right side.
