[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over different
types of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis indica, sativa, rudalis,
and also hemp cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while these different types are kind
of ingrained in the industry, we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn here that the differences may not
be as great as you may initially think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, indicas, sativas, rudalis,
and hemp cannabis may have different looks
[SPEAKER_00]: or different morphologies, but the actual
difference between these plants may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: as great as you may think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I put this disclaimer here because
there's different morphologies that allow
[SPEAKER_00]: us to classify this cannabis, and that's
typically what's used to denote them into
[SPEAKER_00]: different categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the phenotype does not always
match the genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some backgrounds of plants are also not
well known due to the blending of
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while geno characteristics are
presented, please realize that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior may not match the cannabinoids it
can produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this naming inconsistency,
there's a disconnect between research and
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much of this traces back to the
underground market now hitting legal
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've opened up the market for more
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two plants by the same name may not be the
same genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're getting into something that may
look initially the same, but we kind of go
[SPEAKER_00]: into the microscope and then look at the
scientific end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing some great differences that
do occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, why can names be unpredictable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, breeders have been making crosses
and documenting, so we would think they'd
[SPEAKER_00]: be accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without genetic markers being tracked,
there is a high odds of mix-ups occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: just from grower error.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the possibility of misinformation
being spread for the purpose to protect
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders' varieties cannot be ruled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there are two kind of factors at play
that probably contribute the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: these names aren't necessarily directly
matching up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, how are names defined?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, often the structure of morphology of
the plant defines the variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not taken into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chemical profile of the plant creates
an inaccurate correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're kind of basing it on morphology
and as you see here with the plug,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it fits, it's got to be this variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it looks like this, it's got to be
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sadly not the case here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, genotype versus name, it's possible
for the same variety from two different
[SPEAKER_00]: suppliers to have vastly different
chemical profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suppliers will often say, if you find a
good strain, stick with that supplier,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is not a good long-term solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This variability presents a huge
challenge, especially for the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, many have chosen to go
with extractions rather than actual plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that they can know exactly what they're
getting each and every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It means do not trust the name matches a
clearly defined set of effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here with the mouse and the cat,
the mouse should not always be trusting
[SPEAKER_00]: the cat here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure extractions will ensure a consistent
chemical profile, regardless of the
[SPEAKER_00]: starting material.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extractions can be found in purified
products, which reduces variability
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to use of the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics versus observations, there are
databases being constructed, so future
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of cannabis genetics we can
clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, general characteristics of the
three main types of cannabis will be
[SPEAKER_00]: presented here, along with some concerns
of those classifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are starting to pull a greater data
set, what we see, and also genetic markers
[SPEAKER_00]: for the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, cannabis indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the origin as common countries of
Pakistan and Afghanistan were colder
[SPEAKER_00]: climates with shorter seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of where the indica can be
traced back to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The morphology, I call it the George
Costanda of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's short and stocky.
[SPEAKER_00]: These leaves kind of have this morphology
as we see here, short and stocky leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general behavior is conducive to
indoor growing, where space is often
[SPEAKER_00]: limited due to its morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: These dense plants with broad leaves lead
to heavy production with a possibility of
[SPEAKER_00]: four to six crops per calendar year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often marketed as offering
relaxation, decrease nausea and pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: and good for nighttime use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativa, its origin is found more towards
the equator, where the climate tends to be
[SPEAKER_00]: warmer and longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the average day length is stable
over the course of the year, so sativas
[SPEAKER_00]: are thought to originate near the equator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and here looking at the sativa's
morphology, these are considered to be
[SPEAKER_00]: like the giraffe of cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tall and they're thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves are long and thin, which is kind of
the opposite of indicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're physically the biggest of the
three varieties, and they tend to have
[SPEAKER_00]: more continuous growth habit leading to
more arid appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can grow up to 15 feet tall,
can produce higher yields, but sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes a little bit longer for them to
get to this stage, so it comes at the cost
[SPEAKER_00]: of sometimes longer flowering times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's marketed as increased creativity for
people looking to get things done in
[SPEAKER_00]: daytime use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is what they're marketed as,
but this doesn't necessarily mean all
[SPEAKER_00]: sativas will have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the indica versus sativa abate,
despite clear distinction, there's widely
[SPEAKER_00]: presented in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, there's very limited scientific
evidence to support the separation between
[SPEAKER_00]: the indicas and the sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there morphological differences?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the strain classification does
not match the chemical profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativas and indicas can have similar
chemical profiles, despite very different
[SPEAKER_00]: morphologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So indica or sativa, the specific
classification does not correlate with the
[SPEAKER_00]: particular effect or compounds produced,
and this is a big point to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: remember here.
[SPEAKER_00]: While plants look different, this is the
only distinction between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the chemical profiles can be the same,
even though they may look very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is despite what typically is marketed
as one producing one effect and another,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can actually produce very similar
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rudalis is an otter flowering cultivar of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its origin is kind of in cold regions of
countries like Russia and China.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be a distant relative of a
sativa potentially, but because it's otter
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering, it's kind of its own
classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the new kid on the block.
[SPEAKER_00]: The morphology is, I call it the
hummingbird of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's small and fat, it's recognizable by
its small leaves and minimal side
[SPEAKER_00]: branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has this kind of rougher, shaggier
plant structure with thicker stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's an otter flowering strain,
which eliminates the need to be precise
[SPEAKER_00]: with photo period, as it will flower after
three to four weeks of growth no matter
[SPEAKER_00]: the time of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ready to harvest 70 to 110 days from
seed, so this is an advantage of having
[SPEAKER_00]: this otter flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of becomes a robot, kind of
becomes like automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often used as crosses with other
strains to increase yield and have the
[SPEAKER_00]: otter flowering characteristics to carry
over so that growers don't have to worry
[SPEAKER_00]: about the photo period adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Naturally low in THCs, how it's marketed,
short life cycle, advantageous from being
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporated into other hybrids to kind of
give the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of gives that quick cheetah-like
turnaround time and can kind of create
[SPEAKER_00]: this mixture of two different varieties
with good potency and otter flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, which is what growers typically
find advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general morphological summary here,
Indica, Sativa, Rudalis, you can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: see now the comparison between the three
and how they look very differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, keep in mind the chemical
profiles that they produce could be very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar.
Thank you very much for your attention.
