[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to go over understanding
plant hormones in a general sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: not getting into specifics, but providing
with an idea of kind of the commonalities
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst all the plant hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the understanding of plant
hormones here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, in general, plant hormones
are regulators of almost all aspects of
[SPEAKER_00]: plant development and plant responses to
their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're active in very low concentrations,
but have profound effects on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means basically is that it
doesn't take very much of any particular
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone to have a major impact on the
plant that we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant hormones are specifically regulated
and controlled, which is very important
[SPEAKER_00]: simply because of the large impact they
have on the plant growth and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for all stages, everything from
germination to pollination, everything in
[SPEAKER_00]: between and for all plants, not
necessarily just your angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hormones are important signal molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like in animals, same thing that
hormones in plants are also very important
[SPEAKER_00]: and something not to be kind of understood
well, something not to be taken for
[SPEAKER_00]: granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant hormones act as dedicated signaling
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant hormones are synthesized by the
plant and are transported some distances
[SPEAKER_00]: at least one cell diameter within the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of that signaling
molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be produced in one part of the
plant, but might have their effect in
[SPEAKER_00]: another part.
[SPEAKER_00]: These hormones have important and very
specific effects on the physiology,
[SPEAKER_00]: the growth and development in vivo,
which is inside a living organism of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's because they're produced in one
area, they're going to signal to other
[SPEAKER_00]: portions of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is very important for those cells
to be able to signal to one another within
[SPEAKER_00]: the organism to be able to get that plant
noticed effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the plant hormone cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just a couple here,
picked that kind of as a random kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: graph here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, looking at specifics, there's going
to be little differences that do occur,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, but we're looking at basically
the hormone level and basically four
[SPEAKER_00]: stages of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see that certain ones are
very active for the germination phase and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the vegetative growth phase,
they might be reduced and then they might
[SPEAKER_00]: have peaks right before flowering and then
go back down again for the fruiting and
[SPEAKER_00]: ripening stages where others might
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that there's a lot of
imply, a lot of flux that occurs during
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant growth cycle on what hormones
are active when and in relation to what
[SPEAKER_00]: other hormones ones might be active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the binding of hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a general sense, hormones act by
binding to a specific receptor remaining
[SPEAKER_00]: bound and not being modified when acting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about earlier that plant
hormones have a profound effect on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they're active in very small
amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it possible if something in small
amounts have a large effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's happening is the hormone is
binding to a receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our plant cell because there's a
cell wall, here's our receptor binding and
[SPEAKER_00]: then there's a lot of relay molecules,
a transduction pathway occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think of this as if we had a
pyramid of dominoes and we knock one
[SPEAKER_00]: domino over, we're having this kind of
transduction pathway that is resulting in
[SPEAKER_00]: activation potentially of many different
pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to result in a response,
an activation of cellular responses both
[SPEAKER_00]: in this cell as well as potentially
neighboring cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one hormone, that one binding to
one receptor, can cause this amplified
[SPEAKER_00]: effected response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why they can be active even
though their concentrations might be very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we're applying hormones to
plants, this is something that's commonly
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, when we're cloning,
adding rooting hormone, spraying hormones
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plant can be referred to as a
dryness addition where we're applying
[SPEAKER_00]: things to the outside of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a plant recently potentially
sprayed with water that is being added
[SPEAKER_00]: extracellularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rates applied often do not match the
plant produced levels as the goal is to
[SPEAKER_00]: better understand plant response curves at
different levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because the plant produces
hormones at a certain level or
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration, growers might be applying
them at increased levels to help increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the rate of that response, which may
happen in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, if we override certain
hormones, it can actually have negative
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Studies can also investigate how the same
concentration of a hormone may impact
[SPEAKER_00]: different species, tissues, and
development stages with the intention of
[SPEAKER_00]: better understanding hormone impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same hormone applied at different
stages of growth could have potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: very different effects as we saw with that
graph earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's some challenges with our plant
hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most hormones can be synthesized and
degraded by many roots, making them a
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge to study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just applying hormone X and get
response as you would potentially with,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, a fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Major problem when you apply them on the
extracellular basis in dryness levels or
[SPEAKER_00]: the levels within the plant experiments
are difficult to establish causative links
[SPEAKER_00]: between the hormones shown and the
response in vivo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as a reminder, in vivo is in the
living organism and in vitro is in glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in vivo is actually the organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: In vitro might be, for example,
tissue culture as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because we see it in tissue culture
doesn't necessarily mean that may
[SPEAKER_00]: translate to kind of out in a field
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some studies utilize inhibitors or
mutants, which are called knockouts,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they take that gene and they knock
it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They prevent the plant from making it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this aids in the study of certain
hormones impacts on plant development.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if that hormone was missing?
[SPEAKER_00]: How would that impact the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is just kind of that
general overview of plant hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see why they're so hard to study
simply because of all the interactive
[SPEAKER_00]: effects that might occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
