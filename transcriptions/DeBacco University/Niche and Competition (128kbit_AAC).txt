[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're looking at niche or niche
and competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So niche is referring to the pattern of
living and these organisms and species
[SPEAKER_00]: that are all interacting and have
different patterns of living are all in
[SPEAKER_00]: competition for a limited amount of
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how these kind of interrelate is very
important to an ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at communities, let's first
define a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, all organisms that live together in
an area are defined as a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, it can be a little hard to
define because like what type of area or
[SPEAKER_00]: what size or scale of area we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for communities, the different species
compete and cooperate with each other to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a community stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: A community is often identified by the
presence of a dominant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The distribution of other organisms may
greatly differ.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the ranges of all organisms
overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here with our trees and our
shrubs and our ferns and our salamanders
[SPEAKER_00]: all kind of overlap in one another as part
of this community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this niche and competition,
well a niche is a particular biological
[SPEAKER_00]: role of an organism in a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not to be confused with habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So habitat is a place, a niche is referred
to as a pattern of living.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see all these different bird's
beaks, have different niches, different
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns of living that can help them
consume unique food items.
[SPEAKER_00]: So habitat versus niche, a good comparison
between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, habitat is a portion of an ecosystem
occupied by a particular organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a physical place and it reflects the
living place of an organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: A niche, on the other hand, is the role of
an organism in that ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the role is a function or activity and
it reflects the biotic and abiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: associations with the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So comparing habitat to niche,
this is like the physical place and this
[SPEAKER_00]: is a function or activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're kind of looking at
environment now, habitat and niche,
[SPEAKER_00]: we kind of see this stacking doll effect
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the environment is the overarching
thing and that's everything surrounding an
[SPEAKER_00]: organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the air, the rocks, the water,
all of that is the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit smaller than that,
a little bit more specific would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a physical place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the area in the environment where
organisms grow and survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be the ocean habitat,
the forest habitat, the Arctic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a portion of the total environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within that habitat, there's a smaller
portion here where we're looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of the habitat where the living
organism makes its home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is referring to that living and
part of that habitat, part of that
[SPEAKER_00]: physical place and it's how the
interaction is occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So competition is the struggle of two
organisms to use the same resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resources are limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see individuals competing for
mates and competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a limited amount of food,
water, and mates and this is resulting in
[SPEAKER_00]: often competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That occurs amongst the animal species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's two different types of
competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's intra-specific competition,
which occurs between individuals of the
[SPEAKER_00]: same species here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So intra is between the same species,
same single species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inter-specific competition occurs between
individuals of different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see the lion and the hyena.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are different species here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is inter-specific competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see two flamingos competing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is intra-specific competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a fundamental versus realized
niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of competition, organisms may not
be able to occupy their fundamental or
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretical niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where an organism can live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a fundamental niche is referring to
where an organism can live.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this rock here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see these barnacles and organisms
living on this rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the fundamental niche is where an
organism might be able to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is often not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because an organism can live there
doesn't mean it does live there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, organisms often occupy what's
called their realized or their actual
[SPEAKER_00]: niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the organism actually lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these organisms, for example,
let's take the light brown one here,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the blue one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light brown may be able to live on
this entire intertidal zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the high tide mark and then as the
tide goes out, this is the low tide mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this brown organism may be able to live
over the entire rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it gets outcompeted from this
white to gray and this blue one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore its realized niche or its
actual niche where it lives is just below
[SPEAKER_00]: the high tide line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fundamental niche could be for the
entire intertidal zone here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But its realized or its actual niche here
is just near the high tide line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contrast to that, the blue and green,
kind of some of the pinks, they also may
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to live over this entire rock,
but they may be outcompeted here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may need to have a little bit more
moisture, a little bit more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, their realized niche is here
very close to the low tide mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this interspecific competition with
only one winner, we see an example here of
[SPEAKER_00]: blue and red.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two different species competing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see initially they all start off and
then slowly at species one, the red
[SPEAKER_00]: species starts to outcompete species two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see over time, the blue species
actually gets pushed out entirely and only
[SPEAKER_00]: the red species one survives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in that picture, here we see the
brown living with the white, whilst for
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever reason the white can outcompete
the brown and it gets pushed out and
[SPEAKER_00]: therefore there's only one winner in this
interspecific competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: A competitive exclusion could partly
explain this.
[SPEAKER_00]: No two species with the same niche can
coexist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see we'll just call blue species
here and we have a tan orange species
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're grown separately,
we see one that's here, one that's here,
[SPEAKER_00]: different carrying capacity, that's okay,
but both living and able to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all grew alone in different culture
tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is them, this is how they grow
normally, all isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now though, we add something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is competitive exclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now taking these, we're mixing the
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're mixing the blue species here with
the tan orange species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we notice that there's a decline or
extinction here of the tan orange species
[SPEAKER_00]: when the two share the same culture tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because the two have different realized
niches, thus they avoid competition when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're able to coexist, but when they're
mixed together here, we see that one
[SPEAKER_00]: species can outlive the other,
can outcompete the other for food or
[SPEAKER_00]: resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to that competition, the overall
carrying capacity is reduced and if it was
[SPEAKER_00]: just grown alone, but we see that that
mixed population very closely resembles
[SPEAKER_00]: the blue species compared to the tan
orange species here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this helps explain a little bit
of niche and competition that occurs in
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystems all over the world.
Thank you.
Thank you.
