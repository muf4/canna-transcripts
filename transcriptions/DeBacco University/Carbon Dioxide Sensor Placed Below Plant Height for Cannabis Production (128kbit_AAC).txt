[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
we're going to be looking at carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide sensor placed below plant height
for cannabis production and how that will
[SPEAKER_00]: impact the readings that you receive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking to place your carbon
dioxide sensor below the plant height,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's see what effects that will have on
your readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, you need to realize that carbon
dioxide is heavier than air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here's a tank that looks like
a liquid carbon dioxide had a leak and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can see how it fills the streets here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This carbon dioxide will naturally
accumulate at the bottom of a growing area
[SPEAKER_00]: simply because it's heavier than the air
surrounding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sensor reading offset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when placing a sensor below plant
height, this will typically result in an
[SPEAKER_00]: artificially higher reading than the
plants may be experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to keep this in mind if that's
where you're going to be mounting your
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The readings that you get, the controller
is only as good as the sensor placement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get usually readings that are
artificially higher than what the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: might be experiencing and that's at the
plant height slash leaf area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, why would you want to mount your
sensor below plant height?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is only beneficial,
this type of sensor placement,
[SPEAKER_00]: if the carbon dioxide injection point is
higher in the structure and you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a read of what's passing by the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning if you have your sensor down here
and you have your plants growing and you
[SPEAKER_00]: have your injection point only at the top
and you want to get an idea of how much
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide is going past the plants,
that's what your sensor is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: telling you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I would suggest or just grow
suggestions is that if this is the only
[SPEAKER_00]: mounting location you have, you may want
to set the target level a little higher
[SPEAKER_00]: than the optimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply point being to take into
consideration the fact that the reading in
[SPEAKER_00]: this area of the growing space will
typically be higher than what the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making it artificially a little bit
higher will ensure that the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully are getting the optimum level,
which will be a little bit under what your
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor or readout is providing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I would only use this if this was
the only location you could mount it for a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of reasons because you are going
to get that artificially high reading with
[SPEAKER_00]: this sensor placement.
