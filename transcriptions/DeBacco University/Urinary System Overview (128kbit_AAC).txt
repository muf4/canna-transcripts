[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we'll be going over a brief
overview of the urinary system and how it
[SPEAKER_00]: plays an important role in our bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first off, there's five main
functions of the urinary system.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one is to regulate blood volume and
blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does this by adjusting the volume of
water lost to urine and also by releasing
[SPEAKER_00]: renin and erythropyotin.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two ways that our body can help
regulate our volume of blood, but also our
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a little bit of that kind
of complex system here with renin here and
[SPEAKER_00]: angiotensin and a release of hormones that
can cause different changes in our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking specifically at the renin and
angiotensin system, renin is an enzyme
[SPEAKER_00]: that's released by the kidneys,
so part of the urinary system,
[SPEAKER_00]: in response to the drop in blood pressure
which increases the reabsorbing of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be able to reabsorb water in
our nephrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Renin also catalyzes the production of
angiotensin, which is a hormone that
[SPEAKER_00]: causes arterioles to constrict,
raising blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was our normal blood vessel.
[SPEAKER_00]: By constricting through vasoconstrictions,
closing that down, we're causing an
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in our pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will also cause water retention to
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about both of these systems and
how they work to help the body maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: homeostasis of blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it gets too low, what's something that
the body could do?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it gets too high, what's something in
contrast to what we saw before,
[SPEAKER_00]: which way we can kind of reduce our blood
pressure, because we want to maintain that
[SPEAKER_00]: homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the conversion of angiotensin 1
to angiotensin 2, we have a complex
[SPEAKER_00]: process here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to cover it in the very
brief sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have enzyme reaction, the liver
releasing angiotensin into the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kidneys also releasing the enzyme renin
into the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will cascade into angiotensin 1
through enzymatic reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's converted with the ACE, the
angiotensin converting enzyme,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the pulmonary blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is causing angiotensin 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this enzymatic reaction is causing that
conversion to angiotensin 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going to stimulate widespread
vasoconstriction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, arterioles are going to
constrict or get smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to stimulate the adrenal
cortex to secrete aldosterone,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is ultimately going to cause the
kidneys to start to retain more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's stimulating sodium uptake in the
apical cell membrane in the distal
[SPEAKER_00]: convoluted tubule in collecting ducts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't looked at the nephron
video, you're welcome to take a look at
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ADH is causing aquaporins to move to
the collecting ducts and plasma membrane,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is increasing water reabsorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this is kind of occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is helping the body regulate blood
volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Erythroprionin is another one mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a second response to low blood
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Erythroprionin travels to the bone marrow
and stimulates the production of new blood
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does this help maintain
homeostasis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way to think about it is we're
looking at our blood system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're low in blood volume, what's the
way we can increase that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's made in the bone marrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, erythroprionin will be the actual
hormone to stimulate the production and
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the number of red blood cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another function of the urinary system is
to regulate plasma ion concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this does occur in the kidneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much is it going to absorb?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it going to release into the urine?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is part of that urinary system to
maintain that balance between our plasma
[SPEAKER_00]: ion concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another function is to help stabilize
blood pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: This controls the loss of hydrogen ions
and bicarbonate ions in the urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body can help get rid of more of one
or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll keep that pH in a very tight
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the blood is regulated to stay within a
range of 7.35 to 7.45 approximately,
[SPEAKER_00]: here we see 7.35 to 7.39-ish is considered
normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very tight, tight range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between 7 and 8, no, that's a large swing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking into the 100th place of pH
measuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: How it goes about doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our equation here, carbon dioxide
in our water and our carbonic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, hydrogen ions and bicarbonate
ions, the ratio we have of these will
[SPEAKER_00]: determine the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody can go back and forth with this
to help regulate that to maintain the
[SPEAKER_00]: proper homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, the urinary system will
conserve valuable nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can prevent excretion of waste products
if there is a deficiency or it can
[SPEAKER_00]: increase excretion if there's determined
to be an excess of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a way that we want to stay in this
kind of green optimum nutrition that
[SPEAKER_00]: homeostasis we need ways to reduce things
if it gets too high, but also bring them
[SPEAKER_00]: up if it does get too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we're looking at the urinary
system will assist the liver to detoxify
[SPEAKER_00]: poisons, particularly amino acid
metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's things called liver detox.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's detoxing recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: People go on a very simple diet to help
detoxify poisons, but really it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: urinary system on a continual basis,
particularly the amino acid metabolism is
[SPEAKER_00]: what the urinary system needs to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: To help out the liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amino acid metabolism, our amino acids
are building blocks of our proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: not needed for building protein that can
be metabolized for energy or broken apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon chain is used to make fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within our amino acids, we have this
variant R group, our carboxyl group,
[SPEAKER_00]: our hydrogen in our amino group.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be broken apart, particularly the
nitrogen and that can accumulate and that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be of toxic levels potentially within
the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at nitrogen, in particular,
if ammonia is generated, that is toxic and
[SPEAKER_00]: highly water soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want our body to be able to break that
down and convert it in the livers where
[SPEAKER_00]: this occurs, converting this toxic ammonia
into urea, which is less toxic and less
[SPEAKER_00]: water soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these, believe it or not,
are fertilizers that we see applied here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a strong nitrogen component.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hydrous ammonia is one thing that's
applied in a large part across the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And urea is also a form of a nitrogen
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the body wants to go through this
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it breaks down amino acids,
it will generate ammonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to go through the additional
process with the assistance of the liver
[SPEAKER_00]: to convert that to urea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be then carried in the
blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the kidneys, urea and other water
soluble waste are converted into urine and
[SPEAKER_00]: that can then be excreted from the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ammonia also gives off a strong odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urea being less water soluble and less
toxic, ideally be converted, helping
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the stresses on the body and easily
excreted in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for listening and have a great
day's hearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
