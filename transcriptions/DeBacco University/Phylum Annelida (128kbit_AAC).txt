[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're looking at the animal
phylum, Analida.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a nice little way, try to get you to
pronounce the word properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you recognize this picture,
this is the phylum that the earthworm
[SPEAKER_00]: falls under.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's key about this particular
phylum?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's the rise of segmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of in the early
innovations of the body plan of
[SPEAKER_00]: Hercelemates, segmentation is one of those
key factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first kind of phylum that
shows this as an evolutionary kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic body plan, of an analid is that
the tube within a tube concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that the digestive tract is suspended
within the tube of the phylum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see a tube within a tube,
and this actually holds true for us,
[SPEAKER_00]: our intestines and our digestive system is
a tube within our body cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where the term tube within a
tube comes into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm not going to require for at least
my class all the knowing of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual identifications here,
but it could be helpful if we do do a
[SPEAKER_00]: dissection of an earthworm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of the outside view here,
and there's segmentation, there's three
[SPEAKER_00]: key body plan characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is repeated segments, one can be
specialized segments, and one can be these
[SPEAKER_00]: connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each of these plays a role when we talk
about segmentation of a particular animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So worm reproduction, they're very
important for soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pull organic matter, carbon,
base typically, into the soil mixing the
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worms have both male and female
reproductive organs, and this clitellum is
[SPEAKER_00]: the main function to store the eggs of the
worm, that's located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's our clitellum right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this earthworm's mating, it's kind of a
rare sight to see, they're very sensitive
[SPEAKER_00]: to ground movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're walking very heavily on the
ground, most of these worms are very quick
[SPEAKER_00]: about going back down into the burrows
below ground where you won't see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn more about how
earthworms reproduce, there's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube video link provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this might be a little bit shocker
of an image, probably wasn't expecting
[SPEAKER_00]: this, but again, we do that earthworm
dissection, this is another great way to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're not fortunate enough to be
able to take my class and experience it
[SPEAKER_00]: for yourself, this is another video link
here, 21 minutes of an earthworm
[SPEAKER_00]: dissection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you find that interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a little bit longer than this
video here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Key features, here, segments within a long
body that's covered with mucus to help
[SPEAKER_00]: conserve water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we are a terrestrial base,
these animals need to find a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: conserve water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the presence of both a mouth and
an anus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have stiff hair called bristles that
aid in their movement through the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common hermaphrodites, meaning each
individual carries both male and female
[SPEAKER_00]: organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earthworm anatomy, again, remember
earthworms accelerate nutrient cycling in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil plant system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the head region, the mouth region.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where they're first taking in some
of that food and passing it through that
[SPEAKER_00]: tube within a tube concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not gonna be requiring you to know
all the individual parts, just realize the
[SPEAKER_00]: heart, yes that is plural in the many
lines, they have more than one heart
[SPEAKER_00]: there, kind of passing and helping their
circulatory system along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because they're more primitive
doesn't necessarily mean that they contain
[SPEAKER_00]: less organs than we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see an example of hearts with it
being plural, there's more than one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been following on some of the
other videos, this is kind of just that
[SPEAKER_00]: quick summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what distinguishes these three
particular phylum apart from one another?
[SPEAKER_00]: What similarities they may have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of that quick little review
slide for that quick comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you be able to separate these three
different phylum?
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, there's videos on each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
