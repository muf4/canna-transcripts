[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I want to provide a systematic
data-driven review concerning COVID-19 in
[SPEAKER_00]: schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, all sources provided on each slide,
it is mentioned with direct links.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in the video description,
there is a link to the slides for easy
[SPEAKER_00]: viewing and downloading.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll allow you access to those links.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic summaries are children are at
reduced risk from dying from COVID-19,
[SPEAKER_00]: children are poor transmitters of the
virus, and do not just read the headlines,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the actual data and research
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: High COVID areas tend to match high
population areas as well, and we'll see a
[SPEAKER_00]: map of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now deaths in COVID-19 related to age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, COVID-19 does increase directly with
age.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this means is the older you are,
the higher risk of death from COVID-19 you
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the age of 14, really potentially
under the age of 24, the odds of death
[SPEAKER_00]: from influenza or pneumonia are greater
than COVID-19.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what pneumonia is, is basically fluid
filling the airspace in the lungs,
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing the amount of oxygen that can get
to the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the oxygen becomes too low,
that will result in death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's just a kind of combination of
leading causes of death in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: broken apart by different age groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: This provides not just diseases,
but other causes of death based on 2016
[SPEAKER_00]: data, with the higher causes of death
being located at the top, lower ones at
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom, influenza and pneumonia in
kind of these orange boxes, and COVID-19.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the blue boxes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the actual CDC data website that
you can provided here at this link that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can go to and access.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it is, I took this data, I was able
to download it as an Excel file,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is what I generated directly from
that data set we just saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just makes it a little easier to
read, and it's looking at February 1st to
[SPEAKER_00]: August 8th for the United States,
broken apart by age group, allocating
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID-19 deaths, pneumonia, influenza in
total.
[SPEAKER_00]: I then took this data and compiled from
the age of 0 to 14, and put the COVID
[SPEAKER_00]: deaths, pneumonia, and influenza deaths
for comparison between the ages of 25 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in both of these age groups,
these are your typical school age
[SPEAKER_00]: children, pneumonia is of greater risk of
death for people under 24 years old,
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the CDC data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking here at data from the American
Academy of Pediatrics, they stated at this
[SPEAKER_00]: time it appeared that severe illnesses due
to COVID-19 is rare among children,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they have some information current as
of August 13th, 2020 here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is interesting of note is that
children were 0% to 0.4% of all COVID-19
[SPEAKER_00]: deaths, and 20 states reported zero child
deaths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking this information, the definition of
a child does vary by state, so it makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: a little hard to do some comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the greatest age range for the
definition of a child is Tennessee and
[SPEAKER_00]: South Carolina, and they state from
between 0 and 20 years old is a child.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, using the CDC data that I showed,
I'm going to add in from 0 to 24,
[SPEAKER_00]: consider that a child, which technically
is going to overstate cases or deaths,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's going to be used for the
comparison here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the cumulative child cases is
406,109.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total child deaths, and again,
I'm dividing the child as from 0 to 24,
[SPEAKER_00]: would be 291.
[SPEAKER_00]: The child mortality percentage is 0.07166,
and if we look at the United States cases
[SPEAKER_00]: versus mortality percentage based on John
Hopkins University presented by CNN,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at that math comes out to
3.135%, so we can see the child mortality
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage is much reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what about risk to teachers,
since we are talking about schools?
[SPEAKER_00]: For those that have to work with students,
and the concern is the ability to control
[SPEAKER_00]: and track COVID-19 from students,
while the students may be at low risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID-19, what about students' ability to
transmit the virus?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The possibility of carriers and at-risk
populations comes down to the degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: transmissibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Children have been shown to be poor
transmitters of COVID-19, and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the data provided here and
sourced down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this data actually show?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to what extent do children transmit the
COVID-19 virus?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The evidence to date suggests children
spread SARS-CoV-2, which is the COVID-19
[SPEAKER_00]: virus, relatively rarely, and that
children are usually infected by
[SPEAKER_00]: symptomatic or pre-symptomatic adults in
the first 48 hours before they become
[SPEAKER_00]: symptomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: In conclusion, based on the study here,
the available evidence to date suggests
[SPEAKER_00]: that children are unlikely to be major
transmitters of SARS-CoV-2 or the
[SPEAKER_00]: coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there's the citation,
the links, and everything provided there
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about an article like this that
was in the news?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're at this age, you're most likely
to infect loved ones with COVID-19,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I provided the kind of quotation here
from this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: They quote the emerging infectious
diseases, and I went to that source,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So up at the top here is the link provided
to the best life article, and then down
[SPEAKER_00]: here is the link to the actual study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the age groups, and this is the data
table too, the age groups are consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: every nine years, which is great to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the numbers of contacts in
which the percentages are calculated from,
[SPEAKER_00]: because this study is focusing on
percents, well, in the 10 to 19 age group,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's based on 231 participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the next age group of the 20 to
29 age group is based on 3,417
[SPEAKER_00]: participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it's great to compare
percentages, does this really make a fair
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison when there's a 14.79-fold
increase in participants between the two
[SPEAKER_00]: age groups?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's important, again,
to look at the data instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: quoting percentages, where did those
numbers come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what could be contributing to why
children are such poor transmitters?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we mentioned before that they're poor
transmitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why would this be?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the potential explanation for this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And some highlights here provided in this
study are that asymptomatic non-coughing
[SPEAKER_00]: people release less virus-loaded aerosols
to be begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Children have less alveoli and terminal
bronchioles where breast droplets are
[SPEAKER_00]: formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are interior components of the
lung.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like a cluster of grapes and
they create a high surface area to allow
[SPEAKER_00]: gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: But children have less of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Children also have lower respiratory
minute volume and tend to have lower viral
[SPEAKER_00]: loads.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this combined can explain why
children are poor COVID-19 virus
[SPEAKER_00]: spreaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're looking at confirmed
COVID-19 cases in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: we often see maps that look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while maps like this look clean and
are easy to read, the state's borders are
[SPEAKER_00]: man-made.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this isn't easy, recognizable,
and does translate the state-by-state data
[SPEAKER_00]: into a visual very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a more accurate description than
this, where we're looking at actual
[SPEAKER_00]: borders and changes, would be something
that looks more like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is above me is the tracking
of COVID-19 cases in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see all the bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger the bubble, the more cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also see, in comparison,
I pulled the 2016 US population,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see a lot of similarities, indicating
that where we're finding a lot of COVID
[SPEAKER_00]: cases are simply where there's a lot of
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we pick one area out in particular,
the Hawaiian island of Oahu, we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the increased population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sure enough, of comparison to the
other Hawaiian islands, it has increased
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID-19.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, just take this into comparison
when you're looking at states that look
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, Montana looks really large
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very large area and state,
but relatively low population compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: other areas, such as California or the
Northeast, where states might be small,
[SPEAKER_00]: but very population-dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States, people are living
longer, and this is a positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in regards to COVID-19, it does mean
more people will be in the increased risk
[SPEAKER_00]: category.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the demographics here of male and
female in the shift over time,
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing the census data from the year
2000 to 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you look at this by cause in the
world in 2017, I'm not going to bore you
[SPEAKER_00]: with all the details here, but you can see
clearly cardiovascular diseases is number
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respiratory disease is very high,
and that concludes and breaks out lower
[SPEAKER_00]: respiratory infections as well,
being very high normally, and COVID-19
[SPEAKER_00]: falls into that category of being a
respiratory disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're naturally high, and this is
just looking again at 2017 data.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting of note is malaria,
over 619,000 deaths in the world in 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I probably didn't hear a lot about
this, particularly in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there are only about five deaths
reported annually in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly from return travelers, with only
about 1,500 cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to remember we have to
think about things in a worldwide
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, and there's things that can
be resources that can be applied to
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially cure or definitely reduce the
risk or death rate of certain issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is definitely something that should
be considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that malaria is a
mosquito-borne disease caused by a
[SPEAKER_00]: parasite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little different than COVID-19,
but again, we must be thinking about more
[SPEAKER_00]: than just one single country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We must be looking at the entire world,
and where can we try to make reductions in
[SPEAKER_00]: causes of death?
