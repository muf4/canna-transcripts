[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to study PCR,
which is short for preliminary chain
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very brief summary of what this is is
we're simply taking a small amount of DNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: this gene in particular, and we're
multiplying it so we have many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will often be used in research.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be used for gel
electrophoresis, which is another video
[SPEAKER_00]: topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part here is we're taking a very
specific single or small amount of DNA and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're just multiplying it, and this PCR is
an efficient way to go about this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So working with DNA, as I said,
PCR is going to be for amplification.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be used to increase the
amounts of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gel electrophoresis and DNA fingerprinting
are going to be two other videos to help
[SPEAKER_00]: you understand a little bit more of how
scientists can work with DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gel electrophoresis is going to be
separating out of the DNA, and
[SPEAKER_00]: fingerprinting is going to be used to
identify individuals, which you need to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through the previous video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to start with PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another good video to watch as far as how
can a gene of interest be multiplied,
[SPEAKER_00]: provide you with a link here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind all of the slides are
available in the description below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So PCR polymer chain reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this image is attempting to show is
it's amplifying small amounts of DNA to
[SPEAKER_00]: literally thousands of copies,
and commonly used in research labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a double-stranded DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you notice, our five and three primes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're separating that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're then replicating each of these
strands, and then we're taking strands
[SPEAKER_00]: from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're separating out those two strands,
and we're multiplying it from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see from this image here how quick
we can go from one to kind of an
[SPEAKER_00]: exponential increase, and that's what's
important about this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was awarded the Nobel Prize in
1993.
[SPEAKER_00]: So polymer chain reaction, starting with
very small amounts of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important, these very small
amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes only a few molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: One can amplify the DNA to enough to
detect by electrophoresis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That requires a lot of the same copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through these cycles, it's an
exponential increase, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the basic steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires primers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to have our double-stranded
DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to denature it, which is causing
it to separate out primer annealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our primers that are binding to
our double-stranded DNA, and then primer
[SPEAKER_00]: extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're basically going through and
extending out the DNA to multiply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So short single-strand sequence,
the complementary, to regions on either
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the DNA or gene of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is the primer needs to
bind here and work its way this way,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this primer will bind here and work
its way that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, they're working in opposite
directions because DNA is anti-parallel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those five and three primers come back
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the denaturing stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be a lot of
information here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've provided a link down here for some
more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go through all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you the basic steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend you pause the video and
read through these bullet points to help
[SPEAKER_00]: understand this image.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the denaturing step.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting with step one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're heating DNA to about 95 degrees
Celsius, and the DNA strands will start to
[SPEAKER_00]: separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to simply break those high
nitrogen bonds causing what was once bound
[SPEAKER_00]: together to start to kind of separate out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important that these temperatures are
kept very close, 94 to 95 you see
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned here, because if we overheat it,
we're going to denature it to the point
[SPEAKER_00]: that we won't get it back or we're going
to break down any proteins or enzymes that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these numbers are very precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're taking denaturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking our double strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're heating it up to the point it's
starting to fall apart a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The annealing stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at step two now.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this stage, we're starting to cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see 55 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, 50 to 65 is the typical range.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need our primers to be able to bind to
the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need our primers to be able to anneal
to that DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can notice here some of the bases
are listed, and we see it going in
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I highly recommend pause and
review some of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the annealing stage is the annealing
binding of the primers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extension stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as you would guess, where primers
have bound, and now we're extending out to
[SPEAKER_00]: replicate that DNA sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Taq polymerase is very important for
PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taq polymerase is an enzyme, it's a
protein that can tolerate very warm
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, this is 72 degrees Celsius,
not Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Room temperature is typically around 72
degrees Fahrenheit, or 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2 degrees Celsius to give you just an idea
of how warm this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going through and copying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we make two new DNA molecules,
and we repeat the same process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thermal cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three processes through thermal
cycling are repeated 20 to 40 times to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce lots of copies of the DNA
sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new fragments of DNA are made during
the PCR, also in valve templates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This results in a huge number of specific
DNA segments being produced in a relative
[SPEAKER_00]: short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I move myself up here, looking down a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our single molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going through one cycle, one molecule goes
to two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going through another cycle, those two
molecules go to four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those four go to eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight go to 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: After 10 cycles, we're repeating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to 1,024.
[SPEAKER_00]: After 20 more cycles, we end up with
literally over a million molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see how this exponential
increase does occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain things we need So the PCR tubes
are very large.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't require a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have an example of one right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you an idea of what it may
look like compared to a dime.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not very big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not looking at a lot of area
compared to a dime.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not looking at a lot of area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting a lot into these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the basic components are the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need the code to be copied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nucleotides, because we need to make more
DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Primers to bind to the specific region
we're interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buffers to maintain the pH for the enzymes
to work efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And magnesium chloride, which affects the
primary annealing and tac polymerase
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that tac polymerase is an
enzyme that makes the complementary strand
[SPEAKER_00]: of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's high temperature tolerant and doesn't
denature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these little PCR tubes, this is pretty
easy here without having gloves on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see, it can be very difficult
to kind of open and close these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't just do it once.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get literally entire bags of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can go through and they're very
stimulus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, if it focuses on there,
it might say thin wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because you want it thin
because you want the temperature to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to exchange from the outside
environment to the inside environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here's our basic components.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it all kind of mixed in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tac polymerase, our DNA, our nucleotides,
our primer, our buffer solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this is occurring in this small little
tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you an idea of that exponential
increase, kind of putting numbers to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's a number of cycles starting with
basically one copy of DNA, theoretically,
[SPEAKER_00]: and going through about 30 to 34 cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could see how large of an increase
that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, around 30 is what average are
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would only take starting with one copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: After 30 cycles, you would get to this
extremely large number.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see it only takes 20 cycles to
get to literally a million copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just goes exponential from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That puts it in a graphical form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically, the rate of PCR is 2
to the n.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's causing it to be
exponential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So discovery of the tac polymerase,
this is kind of what made PCR possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was discovered in this bacteria in hot
springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the hot springs here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a very warm temperature,
134 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tac polymerase can operate under
these conditions, about 80 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would denature most proteins,
especially our naturally occurring DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: polymerase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the discovery of these hot springs and
these bacteria able to survive in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have proteins that are able to
maintain their function even at these high
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned it was thermocycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of puts it in a graphical
form that I think helps explain it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our initial denaturing, that heating up
to 94 degrees, occurs for about three
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the denaturing process,
we're going through our cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We extend it for another minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We drop the temperature down to 55 or 45
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's allowing the primers to bind or
anneal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're heating it up to 72 degrees to
allow that extension phase to allow those
[SPEAKER_00]: primers to do their job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're repeating this 35 times in this
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see at the very end here,
it says go down to 4 degrees Celsius and
[SPEAKER_00]: hold for infinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is you might turn these PCR
machines on at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically automatically run.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're all done with their 35
cycles, they go down to 4 degrees and just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of hold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 4 degrees is a relatively cool
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically just keeping it and
maintaining your PCR tube with hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: all of your amplified DNA sequence for a
long period of time so you can come back
[SPEAKER_00]: and get it without having anything happen
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that denaturing step,
double-stranded to single-stranded DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: annealing as those primers are starting to
bind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And step 3 is the extension phase here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing all these nucleotides bind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to go back for a second, if you want
more information, I did include a link to
[SPEAKER_00]: PowerPoint that I got some of these great
images from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cycle summary, again, it's kind of
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got your pre-denaturing,
just starting out, then your 30 cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it depends on what you want to
amplify.
[SPEAKER_00]: 95 degrees, down to 52 degrees for that
annealing phase, extension phase,
[SPEAKER_00]: you warm it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the extension we carry out for again,
we repeat the denaturing phase,
[SPEAKER_00]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you an idea, this is a
repeated cycle process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typical PCR attempts and times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is different protocols,
maybe for different DNA sequences in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: The denaturing step at 90 to 95,
it can be changed on how many C to G bonds
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, those have three hydrogen bonds
versus A to T bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those only have two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 25 to 40 cycles depends on the
protocol you need to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that stops the reaction at the very
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It holds for four degrees for basically
infinity or until you come back and attend
[SPEAKER_00]: the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, the temperature might
change with the primers in the A's,
[SPEAKER_00]: T's, and G's and C bonds that you may
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Annealing temperature, depending on that
primer sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a calculator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go through and calculate
any here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to provide you with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could see the difference in
annealing temperature based on the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of G and C bonds that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that temperature, that approximate
melting temperature, temperature melting,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's times two for A and T bonds
added to four times for G and C bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a greater influence on the
temperature that it would take to melt or
[SPEAKER_00]: separate that DNA sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if G and C content is greater than or
equal to 50%, start the Tm for annealing
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're seeing that this is altering
that temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more G and C bonds, the greater the
temperature that's needed to separate
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: These PCR machines I've been talking
about, this is what they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've provided a link to where you can look
at where they're actually offered.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is simply heating and cooling that
specific cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not the very cheap, despite what
they may do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave an example of one here,
over $6,000 for one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see them commonly in labs,
and they vary in price all over,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they all do different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the basic process is all the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some hold more, some have heated lids,
some have other fancy features.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're basically going through that
same heating and cooling phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The history and applications of PCR,
again, you can see in the semis it was
[SPEAKER_00]: first reported that the replication of
single strand DNA from a template was
[SPEAKER_00]: basically discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you could see all the way up to 93
when it was awarded the Nobel Prize in
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're very commonly used in
genomic research, agricultural testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: human identification, and pathogenic
identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want another summary video on this,
I provided a link down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this was helpful in going over
what PCR is.
