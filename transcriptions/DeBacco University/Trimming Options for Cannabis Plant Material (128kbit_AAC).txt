[SPEAKER_00]: So in this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over some trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: options.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to compare wet trimming versus
dry trimming in this video lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over trimming options
for cannabis plant material, comparing the
[SPEAKER_00]: wet trim, where you trim before you go
through the drying process, to a dry trim,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're trimming after a drying
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at these options in more
detail, that wet trimming is the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's cut down and the buds are removed
and then are trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're dried all in one continuous
sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers may refer to that as
what's called bucking up the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of cutting down the plants kind of
all in one fellow swoop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry trimming is the plant is cut down and
then hung to dry for a period of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically somewhere in the five to 10 day
range, which is followed by the removal of
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds from the branches after the plant
material has dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're going to be trimming those
buds when they're dry, this is why it's
[SPEAKER_00]: referred to as the dry trimming process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now getting in a little bit more of the
pros and cons of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're looking at wet trimming,
the advantages of wet trimming is that it
[SPEAKER_00]: can be complete the entire process in one
continuous sequence of steps from cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: down the plant to trimming the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does reduce the drying space that's
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can be advantageous for growers
that are drying space limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also allows for a tighter trim since
the leaves are basically flat at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's less damage to the trichomes
because they're not brutally dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little room for kind of handling
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Waste material can be exposed of
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages with wet
trimming is the process is time sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: As if the plants, we want the plants
sitting around waiting for the trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: phase because the odds of mold will
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also less room for error with the
wet trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some would also argue you also may produce
a little lower quality and flower there
[SPEAKER_00]: with the wet trimming process compared to
the dry trimming process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we're talking about dry trimming,
it is easier to clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trimming can be spread out over more
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also less equipment that's needed
with the dry trim process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantages is there are greater
space requirements to hang those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: during the drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant material is more fragile when
dry compared to when it was wet or
[SPEAKER_00]: recently harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fan leaves typically still need to
be removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good little comparison to wet
and dry trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn about more of these
in detail, you can search this channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, some growers are actually
utilizing both of these methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you utilize both methods?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're combining wet and dry
trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're removing fan leaves right before
harvest to help reduce the labor later and
[SPEAKER_00]: speed up the drying process overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to maintain the trichome
quality by having the smaller leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: around the bud, called the sugar leaves,
act as a physical protective barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows the best of both trimming
options combined into one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many commercial growers will trim wet just
to remove some of the bigger fan leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: and then manicure the buds by hand to
achieve that kind of boutique style look
[SPEAKER_00]: that many consumers are expecting these
days when they come to purchasing a high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality final dry flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching and have a great
day.
