[SPEAKER_00]: Irrigating and watering plants is an
essential part of growing, but properly
[SPEAKER_00]: monitoring plant moisture and knowing and
maintaining proper plant moisture is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important, and many growers will miss
this, either by over or under watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So proper plant moisture, you want to be
in that ideal range, you don't want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: too high or too low, rare cases on both
ends, typically I find a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: common is the over watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over watering, well what's the problem
with over watering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Often growers just love their plants too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they go there, they feel like they
need to do something, so often they feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like, well plants need water, so they'll
water them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of like filling the cup with
water, then just keep the faucet running.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can cause just wasting water for one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also cause roots to rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a very great negative
that can occur from this over irrigating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduces oxygen content in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the extreme example here of trees
growing in a pond here, it looks like it
[SPEAKER_00]: may have been flooded, and we see that
they're unable to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is many of the negatives
associated with over watering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful on what media you're using,
because that can dictate and help regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: how much water you need to add,
and if you're changing medias,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to change your watering
arrangement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're under watering plants,
this can cause plant stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be difficult to re-wet the soil of
your media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once some media dries, especially if it's
peat moss based, it can become hydrophobic
[SPEAKER_00]: and really hard to re-wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where if you forget about the
plants or a pump fails and you go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: re-watering, re-watering can be a very
difficult process to initially re-wet that
[SPEAKER_00]: media.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll dry out some of this, and this is a
high clay, it can crack, but media,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it contains in particular peat moss or
clay pebbles, that can be another
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge to get that to re-wet back to
its original condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course your goal is to have the
correct amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to provide plants with the
moisture they need, allow roots to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that this amount that you're
providing them to have the correct amount
[SPEAKER_00]: could change over the growth of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember when that plant is small,
it's going to require less water,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as it gets larger, it's going to
require more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can be changed too when you go to
transplant and type of media that you may
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always make sure you're maintaining the
proper size, not going too much or too
[SPEAKER_00]: little, trying to hit that nice perfect
amount to keep your plants happy,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will in turn make you happy.
