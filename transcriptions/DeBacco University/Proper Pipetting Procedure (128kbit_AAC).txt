[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over the proper
pipetting procedure, and while there may
[SPEAKER_00]: be different types of pipettes,
the basic procedure holds true for them
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pipetting could be the most important
lab technique to master, so take time to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn how to do this properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why this is the most important
technique to master is you're already
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with small quantities,
so small variations can have a dramatic
[SPEAKER_00]: impact on your end result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take the time to go over, work with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to seem easy the first time,
but keep at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can really refine it and reduce the
chance for errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general schematic here of a pipette,
Gilson was used because that's what I
[SPEAKER_00]: could find online.
[SPEAKER_00]: The template is generally common to all
pipettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to refer to the specific manual
of the pipette that you might be doing and
[SPEAKER_00]: your replacements list for the model that
you have to ensure you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: everything accurate, because again,
we're looking at small variations making
[SPEAKER_00]: large potential effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are springs and seals in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these are things that can wear
out over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are working in a lab, I know
pipettes can be expensive to purchase,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you're going to be working in that
lab, I would recommend you get your own
[SPEAKER_00]: personal set of pipettes to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now while they are expensive, even to
initially purchase, you want to go the
[SPEAKER_00]: extra step of getting them calibrated and
keep them to yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds selfish, but because these
small variations can make a large change,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to make sure that you have an
accurate set so that your lab data has the
[SPEAKER_00]: most accurate and consistent as possible
to reduce the potential for long range
[SPEAKER_00]: work that you have to do to redo an
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when pipetting, the number one reason
for errors is actually distractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be ensured that you're kind
of focused on what you're doing and avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: distractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your attitude is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're angry, moving fast, and not
following the proper procedure,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to cause skewing of the
results as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to ensure you're slowing down and
taking your time because rushing will
[SPEAKER_00]: equal mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just kind of rush through it as I have
to do all this and just get through it
[SPEAKER_00]: quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be advised not to do it at that
time because, again, you could be
[SPEAKER_00]: including more errors in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basics of pipetting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is typically, they can be held in
the left or right hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plunger has two stops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So up here, when you push it down with
your thumb, you're going to feel a first
[SPEAKER_00]: stop and then push even further,
you're going to feel a second stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first stop is the amount of volume
stated on the pipette.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will dispense the correct amount of
liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you would do is you would take
your pipette, if you're going to take up a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain amount of liquid, you depress that
pipette, you put it in the liquid,
[SPEAKER_00]: you depress it to the first stop,
put it in the liquid, and then release it
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly, and you take up that liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to dispense it into another container,
you're going to push down, you feel that
[SPEAKER_00]: first stop, just about all of the liquid
will be dispensed, but you want to go on
[SPEAKER_00]: to the final and next stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will add a little bit extra air,
and it will ensure that there's nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: left in the pipette tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that second stop is that extra
help dispense that liquid, and then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to let it return to its normal
position.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you go through and you feel this,
you feel that first stop and second stop,
[SPEAKER_00]: that first stop or the end result here to
that first stop will be the amount that is
[SPEAKER_00]: stated on the pipette, but there will be a
second stop that will push a little extra
[SPEAKER_00]: air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why for being aggressive,
you can push down beyond that first stop
[SPEAKER_00]: and take up more liquid and not properly
assess the reading that's on the pipette.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll be causing a massive skew in
your results.
[SPEAKER_00]: First step is to select the correct
pipette, so it might seem like they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: pipettes, aren't they?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice the tips of these are
different, and that's because they're for
[SPEAKER_00]: different amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Select the one that's closest to your
target volume, whether it's a larger,
[SPEAKER_00]: a mid, or a small volume, select the right
pipette if you have that option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because while you think, oh, well,
this one can do both, it may not do it as
[SPEAKER_00]: well or as accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step two is to set the knob up properly,
and this is what I was talking about when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're setting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pipette knob will actually rotate and
turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know the volume the pipette's used and the
scale, so you're able to dial this in
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them will say exactly what
they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: This measures 10 to 100 microliters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This measures to 100 to 1,000 microliters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be aware of what you're grabbing
and set it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step three, have the tips in easy to reach
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: These will be the tips because you'll be
using a new one each time you go through
[SPEAKER_00]: and transfer the liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure their arms reach out and out of
the way of the experiment, but still close
[SPEAKER_00]: enough that you're able to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a robotic arm here, and all the
pipette tips are located really close,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the different pipettes are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want them close, but not
necessarily in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, you want to pipette slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Avoid the creation of bubbles,
so this will cause volumes to be
[SPEAKER_00]: inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to allow that to be taken up
slowly and dispensed slowly again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pipette has a little filter tip as
well, so this is another level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they will have that,
sometimes they won't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless, if you're using the filter,
you want to be extra cautious of going
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly because that air does have to pass
through that filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you want to ensure that you're as
accurate as possible because you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be peeing this again and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that was helpful on going
through the basics of a pipette,
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you go and grab one,
you'll be at least initially familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the key part there is simply just
keep practicing with it.
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
