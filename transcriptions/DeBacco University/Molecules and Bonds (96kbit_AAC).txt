[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're gonna be looking at
molecules and bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: See a couple examples presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when I say the word bonds,
we're not talking about James bond,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not talking about Barry bond,
we're not talking about municipal bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about, of course,
chemical bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are chemical bonds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bonds with incomplete valence shells can
share or transfer valence electrons with
[SPEAKER_00]: certain other atoms forming these chemical
bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The formation and function of molecules
depend on the chemical binding between
[SPEAKER_00]: atoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two main classifications are gonna be
covalent bonds, where we see these
[SPEAKER_00]: electrons being shared, and ionic bonds,
where electrons are being transferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with ionic bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Atoms sometimes take electrons from their
bonding partners, as we see in this
[SPEAKER_00]: animation.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example is a transferred electron from
a sodium to chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: See your sodium being transferred over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both atoms have charges in a charged atom
or molecules called an ion.
[SPEAKER_00]: See a positive and a negative here being
drawn together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these ions, remember we call a
positively charged ion a cation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a negatively charged ion an anion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, an ionic bond is an
attraction between an anion and a cation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attraction between a positive and a
negative ion here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's occurring because we're moving
electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, remember electrons have a
negative charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we transfer them, we're also moving
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that depicted here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compounds formed by ionic bonds are called
ionic compounds, or salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the one we're most familiar with
here is sodium chloride, which is table
[SPEAKER_00]: salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's often found in nature as
crystals, and as a result of a metal and a
[SPEAKER_00]: non-metal combine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here, sodium losing that
electron, creating a positive charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorine here gaining an electron,
gaining that negative charge, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: positive negative forming this bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's forming called an ionic bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what that actually looks like is ionic
substances tend to form crystalline
[SPEAKER_00]: lattices rather than distinctive
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ever looked really, really
closely at salt, you'll actually see these
[SPEAKER_00]: little, it looks like little like boxes or
cubes that occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a crystal lattice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because our sodium and our chlorides
fit very neatly together.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go back and look at previous
lectures, we see what happens to the
[SPEAKER_00]: atomic radius of cations and anions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helps you understand why these fit
so neatly together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other form that I mentioned was called
covalent bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the sharing of a pair of valence
electrons by two atoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a covalent bond, the shared electrons
count as part of each atom's valence
[SPEAKER_00]: shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being shared, not transferred,
shared so it can count in both of these
[SPEAKER_00]: particular hydrogen atoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that look?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at our molecules now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a molecule consists of two or more
atoms held together by a covalent bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: A single covalent bond, or single bond,
is the sharing of one pair of valence
[SPEAKER_00]: electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember this line, there's an electron
represented here and here, we just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: connect them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a double covalent, or double bond,
is the sharing of two pairs of valence
[SPEAKER_00]: electrons, as we see here between these
two carbons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's double bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between this carbon and this hydrogen,
we have a single bond that's forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now structural versus molecular formula,
the notation used to represent atoms and
[SPEAKER_00]: bonding is called the structural formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's represented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depicts the structure, how those atoms
are organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty simple, it's only two hydrogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be abbreviated further to what we
call the molecular formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: That example here is just H2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we also see an example of the
structural formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then down here we see the molecular
formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these are representing the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the big black circle, here's carbon
with four hydrogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our two oxygens and two oxygens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forming carbon dioxide and two water
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could say they're essentially
telling the same story, but depicting it
[SPEAKER_00]: in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compound is a combination of two or more
different elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So covalent bonds can form between atoms
of the same element or atoms of different
[SPEAKER_00]: elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that located here with our
carbon binded to our hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon binded to other carbons,
these we will assume are hydrogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gets very important when we start
looking at structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In shape and macromolecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of just that understanding
of what's going on at the molecular level
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A compound is a substance consisting of
two or more elements and a fixed ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: A compound has characteristics different
from those of its elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have carbon and hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon has its properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrogen has its properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we combine them we may get different
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably most obvious here with
sodium chloride that we're also...
[SPEAKER_00]: Sodium chloride that we're also familiar
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sodium itself is actually this kind of
gray looking shiny metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorine, in this case the chlorine gas,
is extremely deadly and has this yellowish
[SPEAKER_00]: almost greenish like look to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we combine these two together we
get sodium chloride table salt,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we've all had.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have inside, that's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sodium looks very different and
chlorine looks very different than sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of how combining
these atoms together can form very
[SPEAKER_00]: different properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essential elements for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 25 of the 92 elements are essential
for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen make
up 96% of living matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the remaining 4% consists of
calcium, phosphorus, potassium and sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's left though is what we call trace
elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are required by an organism in very
small quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here an example of some trace
elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So magnesium would be an example of an
element in very small percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trace is less than 1% and magnesium can
fall into that category, but zinc,
[SPEAKER_00]: selenium, iron, iodine, chromium,
boron, these are all trace elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essential for life, but still needed in
very small amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have certain things called non-polar
covalent bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So covalent bonds is sharing, but
non-polar means atoms share the electron
[SPEAKER_00]: equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of tug-of-war and everyone's pulling
equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: No real favoritism here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is being shared equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be a non-polar covalent bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, think of a polar
covalent bond where the atoms do not share
[SPEAKER_00]: them equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have the same tug-of-war example
where we're getting pulled in one
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: One atom is what we call more
electronegative.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means it has a stronger affinity,
stronger ability to pull electrons towards
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This results in an unequal sharing of
electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will cause what we call partially
positive and partially negative charge to
[SPEAKER_00]: each molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here our big oxygen pulling in
the electrons, creating these weak
[SPEAKER_00]: negative charges resulting in these weak
positive charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these electrons are being pulled
closer to it, this molecule here of oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: takes on these slightly negative charges
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, this area here, these
electrons are pulled away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protons here have a slightly weakly
positive charge here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very important for the properties of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, this concept of
electronegativity, it's an atom's
[SPEAKER_00]: attraction for the electrons of a covalent
bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more electronegative an atom,
the more strongly it pulls shared
[SPEAKER_00]: electrons towards itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most electronegative of atoms here is
fluorine, and the least is francium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see this general trend as we work
our way up and to the right, the greater
[SPEAKER_00]: electronegativity atoms are located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are weaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of gives you an idea of the
trend within the pure act table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's called a dipole is polar
bonding between atoms produces a polar
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule, where polar is unequal sharing,
which has areas with slightly positive or
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly negative charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our oxygen, slightly negative,
or slightly positive charges here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This creates a dipole where there's a
concentrated positive charge separated
[SPEAKER_00]: from a concentrated negative charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrogen bonds, a hydrogen bond forms when
hydrogen atoms covalently bond to one
[SPEAKER_00]: electronegative atom is also attracted to
another electronegative atom.
[SPEAKER_00]: In living cells, electronegative patterns
are usually oxygen or nitrogen atoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hydrogen bonding that joins water
molecules are weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only about 1 20th astron is a covalent
bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while they are bonds, but they're very
weak bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that represent these lines here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a weak negative, a weak positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, our hydrogens are going to
have this bond forms called hydrogen bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: We represent with the lines, it's pretty
easily broken, but it does kind of stick
[SPEAKER_00]: together for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have something called van der Waals
interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If electrons are distributed asymmetry in
a molecule or atoms, this can result in
[SPEAKER_00]: hotspots of positive and negative charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: These van der Waals interactions are
interactions between molecules that are
[SPEAKER_00]: close together as a result of these
charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And geckos kind of use this as their
ability to stick to walls and ceilings
[SPEAKER_00]: because of these particular interactions
that occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see a little close up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collectively, such interactions can be
strong because there's a lot of surface
[SPEAKER_00]: area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of opportunities for these van der
Waal interactions to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is because of the toe hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what allows geckos to cling or
kind of stick to wall or ceiling surfaces,
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing them to run up that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dipole-dipole interactions, these are
partial positive and negative charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molecules orient themselves with positive
being attracted to the negative charges we
[SPEAKER_00]: see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like, think about almost like a
magnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this occurs in hydrogen bonding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also occurs in ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be induced and also hydrogen
bonding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, weak chemical bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the strongest bonds in the
organism are covalent bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ionic bonds have the strongest bond
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see our way that we're working down in
the lineup here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weak chemical bonds, such as hydrogen
bonds and van der Waals, are also
[SPEAKER_00]: important because they reinforce shapes
and adhere molecules together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while these are weaker bonds,
don't think that they're necessarily less
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very important when we start
thinking about protein folding,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is important for enzymes,
which is important for our structure
[SPEAKER_00]: determining function.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way a protein folds will impact its
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way it folds may be dependent on
hydrogen bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though they're weaker, rather than
ionic and covalent, they still are very
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that was a nice general quick
overview of molecules and bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
