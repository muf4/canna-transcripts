[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to be looking at the
cytoskeleton in non-membranous structures
[SPEAKER_00]: within the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a cool picture here showing some
of the interior structures that occur
[SPEAKER_00]: within a cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off we have ribosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of an important component to cells
in the sense that they are the site of
[SPEAKER_00]: protein synthesis within the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're composed of rRNA, that's ribosomal
RNA, and they have a large and small
[SPEAKER_00]: subunit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here the large in the red and
the small in the blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: These subunits are made in the nucleolus
of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be the little dark circle you
see within the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one large and one small subunits make
a functional ribosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need both components there to be
functional to allow those proteins to be
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we kind of look at the image here,
remember that ribosomes are
[SPEAKER_00]: three-dimensional, so that's why I kind of
show this kind of three-dimensional shape
[SPEAKER_00]: here and their important shape allows them
to perform their very important function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have their messenger RNA that comes
out of the nucleus, then there's two
[SPEAKER_00]: subunits of the ribosomes come together
and they allow that translation process to
[SPEAKER_00]: occur to allow messenger RNA to
essentially be translated into a
[SPEAKER_00]: polypeptide chain which ultimately will
form a protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these ribosomes may be located either
in the endoplasmic reticulum, they were
[SPEAKER_00]: making it rough as we can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These little purple circles here would be
the rough, the rough would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: ribosomes in the rough ER and they're also
free in the cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can occur in small groups or they can
kind of be free-floating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not just attached to the
endoplasmic reticulum, they can also be
[SPEAKER_00]: free-floating.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter where they're located,
they're doing the same basic function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now ribosomes are RNA protein complexes
composed of two subunits joined and
[SPEAKER_00]: attaching that messenger RNA in the center
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the site of that protein synthesis
and they're assembled in that nucleolus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here the mRNA coming through and
our newly born protein which is those
[SPEAKER_00]: linking of all those amino acids that are
brought together by the transfer RNA here
[SPEAKER_00]: and the sequence is very important for
their function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going into the cytoskeleton, a eukaryotic
cytoskeleton is a network of filaments and
[SPEAKER_00]: tubes that extend from the nucleus to the
plasma membrane that support the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: shape and anchor organelles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like that interior webbing to
the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helps it maintain its shape and assist its
movement of the cell and organelles within
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's assembled and disassembled as needed
depending on the particular functions that
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell needs to be carrying out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now within that cytoskeleton, there are
three types of macromolecular fibers,
[SPEAKER_00]: actin, intermediate, and microtubules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see here they both have kind of
this very interesting hair-like kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: structural component view to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within those actin filaments, there's
stress fibers that, within the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoskeleton and they help with the cell
move with motility.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're extremely fine and they twist like
pearl necklace here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could help give them some strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dense web just under the plasma
membrane that maintains the cell shape and
[SPEAKER_00]: they support the microvilli and are also
found in intestinal cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have also have with the
cytoskeleton, as I said, in the small
[SPEAKER_00]: intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this intercellular traffic control for
moving components around within the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: also helps with those cytoplasmic
streaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: These kind of red lines represent the
actin filaments and their whole point is
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of keep these villi apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want them all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to maintain this high surface area
to volume ratio and actin filaments help
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within those actin filaments, they can
pinch mother cell into two after animal
[SPEAKER_00]: mitosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an important component in muscle
cells also for contraction other than
[SPEAKER_00]: myosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are indications, these are very
strong filaments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to kind of pull those cells
apart during the mitotic process,
[SPEAKER_00]: also important for your muscles when
you're having contractions to occur,
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing that sliding filament theory to
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those have to be very strong to endure the
stresses that those cells are under.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have intermediate filaments and
they get their name because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediate in size between actin and
microtubules in the rope-like assembly of
[SPEAKER_00]: fibrous polypeptides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this twisting action can help
increase their strength without
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily causing a large increase in
bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they vary in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, from tissue to tissue, from time to
time, so these intermediate ones can kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of change a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do function to support the nuclear
envelope, cell-to-cell junctions,
[SPEAKER_00]: like those holding skin cells tightly
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do have some vital components,
but they are not kind of one particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: set thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can vary a little bit from tissue to
tissue in the time to time as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keratin, we might be familiar with the
structure of our hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's composed of a lot of intermediate
filaments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nuclear plasma membrane connections,
again, gives you that idea of how
[SPEAKER_00]: something can be very thin, but yet also
very strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keratin is composed of those intermediate
filaments to give you a little bit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you braid your hair, you know it
can be stronger in that ways, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of what these can do on the molecular
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: These microtubules, these are
intracellular transport, chromosome
[SPEAKER_00]: segregation, and these are like
microtubules, they're like little tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hollow cylinders and made up of
two globular proteins, alpha and beta,
[SPEAKER_00]: tubulin, kind of here's a cross section to
kind of show you that kind of like tube
[SPEAKER_00]: that they do have in their appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're assembly, they're under control of
microtubules in the organization center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most important is the centrosome,
when we're looking at kind of dividing a
[SPEAKER_00]: cell, as you see here, interact with other
proteins and cause some movement of
[SPEAKER_00]: organelles within a cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to just think about cell
dividing, and that's one, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: organelles need to be moving within a
cell, and microtubules help with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're important for motor proteins,
so what's a motor protein?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well those help use energy from ATP
hydrolysis to move proteins along the
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate, helping that movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about sliding filament theory,
you're seeing that movement that's
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring in microtubules are an important
component for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's centrioles, there's hollow
cylinders, as we can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're short cylinders, they have a nine
plus zero pattern for microtubule
[SPEAKER_00]: triplets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps give them kind of like a
collection of straws is a way to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about it, at least how they look visually.
[SPEAKER_00]: The centrioles found mostly in eukaryotic
cells involved in the process of cell
[SPEAKER_00]: division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Centrioles may be involved with
microtubule formation, disassembly during
[SPEAKER_00]: cell division, and in the organization of
cilia and flagella, which I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about in a little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see again, it looks almost like a
circular form of uncooked pasta,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these microtubule arrays of cilia and
flagella, they contain specialized
[SPEAKER_00]: arrangements of microtubules.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're for locomotion, they help the cell
move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cilia and flagella share in common ultra
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, cilia is only found in
eukaryotes, that's an important note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prokaryotes do not have cilia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see cilia, you immediately know
you're dealing with a eukaryote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prokaryotes do not have cilia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see kind of the picture here of a
flagella.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now getting to a little bit more detail
here, cilia, small, numerous, flagella
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to be large and single.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the flagella here on the sperm
cell, and we have the cilia here kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: on the surface, look like little tiny
hairs or appendages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cilia and flagella both help move when the
microtubule doublets side past one
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each cilium or flagellum has a basal body
at its base, kind of acts as an anchoring
[SPEAKER_00]: point to help that cell move.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flagella are hair-like projections in
the cell that aid in movement,
[SPEAKER_00]: and are found in both prokaryotes and
eukaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prokaryote flagella are small.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a simple structure of rotary
movement, and they're proton-driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eukaryote flagella, because both can have
a flagella, they tend to be larger and
[SPEAKER_00]: more complex structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a bending movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of think about it, it was one kind
of like spins, like a rotary movement,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one is kind of just a back and forth
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's to see the comparison between
the prokaryote and eukaryote flagella.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in eukaryotes, cilia are much shorter
than flagella.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cilia move in coordinated waves,
like oars or kind of like the wheat in the
[SPEAKER_00]: wind, often used in preventing dust
accumulation from your respiratory system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of like as a filtering
component.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flagella move like a propeller or a
corkscrew, kind of that kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: rotary movement there, and commonly used
for locomotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as they would in a boat, they help
the cells move as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cilia only found in eukaryotes for
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that forward stroke and that back
stroke, you kind of have that back and
[SPEAKER_00]: forth kind of motion, like kind of kelp in
the rising and falling tide or in the
[SPEAKER_00]: waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our eukaryotes, cilia and flagella
motion, the flagella, as I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: moves in kind of a sneak-like propelling
cells, kind of back and forth motion,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the cilia have that direct back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say that motion of flagella,
kind of like that propelling cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like that propeller, kind of
spinning, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cilia have that true back and forth,
that fixed point back and forth motion,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually like a beating rate for about 40
or 60 strokes in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're moving very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a picture here, kind of I think of
like the kelp underneath the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very slow movement, but the same
general movement there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the extracellular matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's secreted by cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the exterior portion of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large number of fibrous proteins,
collagen is one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be familiar with hearing that in
ticula hair products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bound by integrin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's helping kind of like stick
everything together, helping that cell
[SPEAKER_00]: communicate potentially with other cells
and bind together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extracellular matrix can also be
important for communication between cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just another example of a component
within our cells.
