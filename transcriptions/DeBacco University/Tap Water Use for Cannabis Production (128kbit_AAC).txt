[SPEAKER_00]: Here on Tobacco University, I'm going to
go over tap water use for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to tap water or city water,
a lot of growers won't utilize it for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, but however, it can be a viable
resource to use for irrigating your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and potentially can cause no harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the basics of tap water or city
water is that it's the easiest form of
[SPEAKER_00]: water as it comes directly from the tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many growers, this is what they mainly
have access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it should be tested to know what
is in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will vary based on your location and
even within your town.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're getting town or city water,
you can call up the water company and
[SPEAKER_00]: typically they're doing testing anyway on
a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to know what is in your water
because one town or one location of town
[SPEAKER_00]: might have different levels in another
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to know what actually is
in your tap water or city water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can tap water be used for cannabis
production?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, yes, and it can produce
quality yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of growers often want to shy away
from this, want to go through these
[SPEAKER_00]: massive purification processes,
some conditions that's justified,
[SPEAKER_00]: but other conditions it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other cases potentially could cause
plant damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's knowing again what is in your tap
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a general term that we give to a
variable source of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when it comes to cleaning your tap
water, depending on what your tap water
[SPEAKER_00]: contains, different filter options may be
utilized to purify the water to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: usable for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't need to use everything here
in the picture, but these are just a
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling of some filtration methods mainly
used for kind of house filters that can
[SPEAKER_00]: easily be implemented to help purify that
water that you have coming from the tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now which filter is best?
[SPEAKER_00]: I put best there in quotes because filter
selection should be based on what the
[SPEAKER_00]: grower wants to filter out of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different filters have different target
substances, so the best filter is one that
[SPEAKER_00]: matches the substances the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it looks clear doesn't mean
it's free of contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it looks dirty doesn't mean
it's absolutely horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at these two water sources will
require different methods of filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, some filter options.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a carbon filters which remove
chemicals and heavy metals, and then there
[SPEAKER_00]: are sediment filters which capture and
remove particulate matter such as soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: debris from the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn more about either
carbon filters or sediment filters,
[SPEAKER_00]: check out other videos here on Tobacco
University.
