[SPEAKER_00]: If you're considering using biodegradable
mulch to suppress weeds in your field,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a great video because we're going
to analyze a research report and provide
[SPEAKER_00]: you with some information and hopefully
some useful information so you can be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to apply this to your own growing
situation here on Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into biodegradable
mulch for weed suppression study related
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, this is the research article
so you're welcome to, again, take a look
[SPEAKER_00]: at it here, look at it for yourself,
look at some of the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to provide a summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what was the study
objective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the study objective was to evaluate
the effectiveness of several biodegradable
[SPEAKER_00]: mulches on weed control and yield of
processing tomatoes in different areas of
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal was to find an alternative to
standard black polyethylene mulch in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to reduce the waste problem that is
generated from that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This study investigated a field trial at
four local locations in Spain over three
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a randomized complete block design
with at least three replicates of nine
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tomatoes being studied,
since a long-term study regarding cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: of this type does not exist, in this
example, tomatoes are being used as a crop
[SPEAKER_00]: of comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the study review,
based on the results, specific
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations for cannabis production
will be provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, even though this study was done
for tomatoes, they have their own
[SPEAKER_00]: specialties, we're going to try to relate
this to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the treatments studied, there was nine
and you can see them all listed here with
[SPEAKER_00]: one being basically an untreated control,
one being manual weeding, conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic mulch, and then different types of
biodegradable plastic mulch, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: paper mulch were studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the details listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to pause the video and
again, go through these in more detail if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's of interest to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So weed densities at the four locations,
again, another great opportunity here to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of pause the video and kind of go
through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the different areas,
the different years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's great about this is we're seeing
multiple years of comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weed densities of main weed species
found in different years and locations in
[SPEAKER_00]: the untreated control plots 63 days after
transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're having some time for those
weeds to build up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the locations, we see the weed
species, we see the total weeds listed
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great here opportunity to pause
the video and do a little comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the weed control 63 days post
transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, now we're getting into some more
of the numbers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's again, what makes this study
great and allows you maybe if you find
[SPEAKER_00]: something of interest to really go through
and look at the specifics and see how that
[SPEAKER_00]: compares.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at the weed control 63
days after transplanting, depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment for different locations and
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's just important to note is that
we've got our letters here and if they all
[SPEAKER_00]: have the same letter, so for example,
this location, these should be considered
[SPEAKER_00]: not to be statistically different.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we see different letters,
that's where we start to see some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: differences and source of comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as a quick example here for this
year across all these different trials,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically there was no difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we're looking at the numbers
and go they're different, but we look at
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of put it to a statistical test.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really, really no difference this
year, no matter what type of weed
[SPEAKER_00]: suppression you used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other locations we can see for the vast
majority, very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here barley straw vastly
different than any of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how you kind of go about reading
this data table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Income benefits and related tomato data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at here cost income and
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our income, here's our benefit and
percent compared to polyethylene or the
[SPEAKER_00]: standard plastic mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this example, untreated controls,
percentage compared would be under,
[SPEAKER_00]: would be less than using polyethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Untreated is just leaving it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here, weeds sure definitely add up
added some competition and definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others we can see the polyethylene was
kind of that source of comparison,
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see everything else was of
course better than the untreated control,
[SPEAKER_00]: but didn't quite meet the levels of
polyethylene here for comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we will look at the category
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So biodegradable plastics can be an
alternative to polyethylene due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: overall good weed control and high,
in this case, tomato yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paper mulches do not perform as well
overall, but are more difficult to apply
[SPEAKER_00]: and avoid fracturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, these are the only products that
control nutsedge emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So paper mulches are the only ones we see
here that would control nutsedge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have nutsedge as a problem in
your area, they can puncture right through
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have these as a major kind of
contaminant, kind of a weed in the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: using the paper mulches can suppress them
from being able to poke their way up and
[SPEAKER_00]: through your mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we also have economic considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very important consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biodegradable materials do provide
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in all cases, they were less when
compared to polyethylene or traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why a plastic mulch still remains
the most commonly used option,
[SPEAKER_00]: despite the disposal issues, as well as
some other issues that it has,
[SPEAKER_00]: still the most widely used option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to manual weeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So manual weeding did result in low weed
densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, depending on the area and labor,
this may be cost prohibitive, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the size of your operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, when applying these findings
to our cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in season, plastic offers many
benefits, but growers must consider the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the typically well-established root
system, based systems of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: this can make the removal of plastic
mulches at the end of the season much more
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging in addition to the disposal
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the field you're planting cannabis in
has nutsedge though, which is sadly
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming a bigger problem in many
agricultural fields, the more I go into,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more problems it seems like there are,
growers should consider the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: potential paper mulch, because that is the
only mulch that is resistant to the
[SPEAKER_00]: emergence of nutsedge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutsedge can emerge through plastic mulch,
punches right through, and only paper
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch has shown effectiveness at reducing
its emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where knowing your field can
also be important to know that,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, there's a lot of nutsedge in this
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I would consider the use of a paper
mulch over a plastic mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you can see, plastic still
regarded as the number one use because of
[SPEAKER_00]: its benefits, but you want to look at this
data and see which would might fit your
[SPEAKER_00]: situation the best.
