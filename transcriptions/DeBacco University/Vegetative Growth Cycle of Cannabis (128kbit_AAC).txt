[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here we're looking at the
vegetative growth cycle of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that vegetative state is
focusing mainly on the leaves here and not
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately producing any flowers,
but producing a plant with good structure
[SPEAKER_00]: and that can carry itself well into the
flowering stage, which follows the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, vegetative growth of
cannabis, excluding root alice,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it receives 16 plus hours of a
continuous light, it'll remain in the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative growth phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, the more light the plant
receives, the greater the growth will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, again, to some extent because
there can be burning that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if we look at nature,
ferns grow below tall trees, and these
[SPEAKER_00]: ferns need diffused and reduced light,
so they're best suited for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trees, however, they're growing taller
and stretching so that they're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: capture more of the light with their
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, growing leaves, we're going to need
our cannabis leaves here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to provide not only quality
leaves, but also quality structure to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is setting the plant up for the
flowering stage that's going to come after
[SPEAKER_00]: this vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be considered one of the most
important phases of a life cycle because
[SPEAKER_00]: you can determine the yield in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though there's no flowers
produced, if you treat plants poorly or
[SPEAKER_00]: set them up poorly in the vegetative
state, they will have poor flower
[SPEAKER_00]: production because they're not well-tuned
or prepared well to go under the stresses
[SPEAKER_00]: of producing flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why this is often considered one
of the most important phases, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: it is not producing any end flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to maintain these 16 plus or 18
plus hours of light, you need to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: quality timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to keep it in the vegetative
growth phase as long as you see desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where timers become important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're looking at a timer and you
set it to 16, 18 hours of light and you
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it at that phase, you don't change
it, your plants will continue to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: under the vegetative growth phase of the
life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you go through and flip the
timers, that can cause them to go into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, or if you have a timer that
malfunctions, that's something you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep an eye on because that can also cause
them to go into flower prematurely.
[SPEAKER_00]: While flowering during the vegetative
cycle, so under normal growing conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: after about four to six or so weeks of
vegetative growth, plants will start to
[SPEAKER_00]: exhibit something called preflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a male plant, it will produce
flowers sooner than a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the male flowers look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the ones that you want to cull
sooner to prevent any potential unwanted
[SPEAKER_00]: cross-pollination with the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what a female preflower will look
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at the vegetative
state, yes, we're looking at plant
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, yes, we're looking at leaves,
but there will be the initial form of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are preflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not mature in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are showing you, though,
or demonstrating the gender of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll either have female flowers,
pre-female flowers, or pre-male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, the male flowers typically show
up sooner because they're looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce pollen to pollinate the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetative to flowering switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once preflowers are observed, changing
these plants' photo periods to an even 12
[SPEAKER_00]: hours of light and 12 hours of dark will
induce the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep them under there, hopefully
they'll continue to grow and expand a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit during the flowering stage and
get the buds that you desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that flipping these plants is
advised after you start to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: preflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like your indication that
those plants can make the switch over to
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowering one.
