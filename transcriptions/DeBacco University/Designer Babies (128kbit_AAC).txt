[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at the
controversial topic of designer babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question probably right now in
your mind is, is that a picture of me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll get right to it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is no, that is not a picture of
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to find a cute baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want a picture of me on the
title slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so starting with, what is a
designer baby?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a baby whose genetic makeup has
been artificially selected for through the
[SPEAKER_00]: process of genetic engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real question comes in is,
should couples be given the right to alter
[SPEAKER_00]: their children's genes based on their own
preferences and or likings?
[SPEAKER_00]: So should we allow parents to be able to
modify or pick, for example, here you see
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the eye color of their unborn baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a real-life situation related to
designer babies is Adam Nash was one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the world's first designer babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why this one is an
important case, and this occurred back in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2000, is that through the process of the
parents having certain genetic disorders,
[SPEAKER_00]: this child was born through the process of
what we would term now designer babies to
[SPEAKER_00]: select for an individual that didn't have
the complications that were present as
[SPEAKER_00]: carriers in both of the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So combination in vitro fertilization,
where the egg is fertilized with sperm
[SPEAKER_00]: from outside the womb, embryos are grown
to the eight cell stage and are checked
[SPEAKER_00]: for genetic disorders at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a major treatment in infertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now being used for other reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only healthy embryo was transplanted
into the mother's womb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they grew up some cells, and they only
selected the ones that were a healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: individual to avoid some complications or
disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, tied in with that real-life
situation is parents are both carriers for
[SPEAKER_00]: a gene mutation that led to their first
daughter, Molly, being born with a rare
[SPEAKER_00]: and devastating genetic disorder of
anemia.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, for her, what she had to go
through was a bone marrow transplant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and she is now healthy and given a second
chance of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So red blood cells come from marrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the genetic disorder was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the process of a marrow
transplant, which is a very difficult and
[SPEAKER_00]: painful and trying process, Molly was
given a new chance there on life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the designer baby, again, going back
here, Adam, through the process of genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering did not have to go through
that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So simply having the genes modified
avoided the entire anemia from occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doctors fertilized several out of
mother's eggs, but only implanted one that
[SPEAKER_00]: was genetically healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They selected for that one that did not
carry those genetic disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, now we're looking at designer
babies today, to date, genetic technology
[SPEAKER_00]: has only been used to treat serious
diseases in children.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the possibility to alter anything from
gender to disease and eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance, personality, even IQ,
is a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's called a slippery slope
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some believe that parents will eventually
use this to choose their own children's
[SPEAKER_00]: genes and push for the creation of these
designer babies, selecting for what they
[SPEAKER_00]: want their unborn child to look like,
what they want personality, and so on and
[SPEAKER_00]: so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the advantages of designer babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's some real pros to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allows couples who can't conceive normally
to have children.
[SPEAKER_00]: A genetic screening reduces babies'
chances of being born with serious genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increases the likelihood of a healthy
baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allows couples to balance gender in their
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: If some families have a lot of males or a
lot of females, they can balance that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can choose male or females.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fear is, though, they might be
selecting for vision, for high IQ,
[SPEAKER_00]: for no baldness, for perfect pitch,
and so on, and other traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you also notice the letters this baby
is playing with might give you some
[SPEAKER_00]: indication of how that connects to
designer babies and DNA, is my hint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So designer babies' disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it moral or ethical?
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much playing like God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Embryos would be killed, selected against.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that didn't turn out right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could have been turned into humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's social concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: High cost leads to gaps in society.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could lead to eugenics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeding of individuals that are bred
or designed to build social preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetically enhanced people may start to
feel superior to those who have not been
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically altered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lead to selection for different social
worth feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there could be implications just beyond
sequences of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found some interesting graphs and some
comparisons here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invite you to pause the video at any
time so you can look at these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to read some of the titles
and want you to take a look at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genetic design.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do parents want to alter the most?
[SPEAKER_00]: The standpoint is, alteration is ethical
or unethical.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do parents want to alter the most?
[SPEAKER_00]: You see some traits here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one, another comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do women and men, or how would women
and men design a baby's personality?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what the men, I'm sorry,
the women would want.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the men would want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the percentages are pretty close
on some things and then a little different
[SPEAKER_00]: on others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, how would women and men design a
baby?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a little comparison of health
and weight and attractiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hair color, what color would they want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, for women that would be designing a
baby versus men.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting to see the gender differences
between the two there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, how Europeans and Americans would
design a baby's personality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a baby made in Europe and a baby made
in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at some of the same traits as
the one before for male to female and how
[SPEAKER_00]: European Americans would design a baby,
again, based on some of those same traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eye hair color, eye color, and so on and
so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just an interesting comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just food for thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is just all theoretical,
but just gives you an idea that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: differences between males and females and
also different regions of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for or against designing a baby,
what would you choose and why?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you support the idea for designing
a baby?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you use genetics engineering for
children simply to make them more
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligent or better looking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to have a blonde haired,
blue eyed girl?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like the process of not knowing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, are you for or against supporting
this idea because it's an issue we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be faced with going into the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just some conclusions here after looking
at some of the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems immoral or unethical to test embryos
for certain genes and tamper with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology's still developing,
so safety's still a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Children's lives could be saved.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a major advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fewer children would be born with genetic
disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many advantages and disadvantages
of designing a baby, and you should keep
[SPEAKER_00]: an open mind and an unbiased attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have the name here.
[SPEAKER_00]: People attempting to conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: People attempting to conclusions
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you think initially,
oh, yes, for it or no, I'm against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at some of both sides and develop an
educated decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another possibility here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it possible to have three parents?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is yes, it actually is
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we know, we get the mother's egg,
the father's sperm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come together and they make an
individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we have to remember there's DNA
in the mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So technically, we could get a surrogate
mother or another mother's DNA for the
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondria and put that into a cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And technically, that individual would
have the mitochondria of the other mother,
[SPEAKER_00]: the main egg in genes from this mother,
number one, and the father's genes from
[SPEAKER_00]: number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, it is possible to be born from
three parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it shows a better, probably a
better example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking the mother's egg, the nucleus is
removed and destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking, inserting it here with the
donor's normal mitochondria, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we're taking the sperm from the father to
generate the individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be used in situations where the
mother's egg has abnormal mitochondria
[SPEAKER_00]: that could lead to genetic disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking the nucleus here removed and
transferring that to the donor,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a most of the genes are kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's not a lot of genes in the
mitochondria, but there are some.
[SPEAKER_00]: So technically, this embryo would be
developed from three parents, two mothers
[SPEAKER_00]: because all of your mitochondria come from
your mother and your father's sperm cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just an interesting food for thought
and kind of the weird things that can
[SPEAKER_00]: occur with science when you understand all
of the basics behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just should this be allowed,
again, we're selecting against the
[SPEAKER_00]: abnormal mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help the individual in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about ethics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just because it's possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it mean we should do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the main question.
Thank you.
