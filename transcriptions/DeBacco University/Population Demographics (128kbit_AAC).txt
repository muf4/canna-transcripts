[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at
population demographics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see pictured here is a
population pyramid, and it goes over and
[SPEAKER_00]: it shows the number of individuals in a
certain age of the male and female gender
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, this is representing the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: population for the year 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to look at some of these
and understand a little bit more about
[SPEAKER_00]: what this may show us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, population demography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, demography is a statistical study of
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Demos, meaning people, and graphy,
meaning a measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a measurement of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we may be familiar with kind of the
world population here in billions and the
[SPEAKER_00]: exponential growth that we're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it going to continue at a high
rate, continue at a medium rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: or continue at a low rate, or actually
degrade, is the question here that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this study helps us predict how
population sizes will change going
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the growth rate is sensitive to the
sex ratio, which is the males to females,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the age structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many young people, how many older
people, and how many middle-aged people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look here at the world here,
well, the sex ratio, the portion of males
[SPEAKER_00]: to females in a population is the basic
definition of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of births is usually directly
related to the number of females,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're the ones that can bear
children.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see our map indicating here,
blue indicates countries with more females
[SPEAKER_00]: than males.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Countries with the same number of males or
females are in green, and countries with
[SPEAKER_00]: more males than females are in red there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And note it is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can be a little misleading when we
see some of these large areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, this is just looking at the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't saying that there's a definite
border here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's looking at just the sex ratio of the
different countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see definitely a general trend
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These countries having more males than
females, and in the United States here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and North America overall having more
females than males.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gender gap in India, the child sex
ratio, overall there are more males than
[SPEAKER_00]: females in various Indian states,
particularly in the northern area,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there can be as many as 125 to 130
males to females, to 100 females.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the long-term impacts
overall?
[SPEAKER_00]: Population of this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a country that has this many more
males than females, how is this going to
[SPEAKER_00]: impact different areas?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the thing we need to think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when there's a gender gap,
these are some of the questions that are
[SPEAKER_00]: generated as the impacts it can have on
that country in the long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the gender gap in the worldwide view
here, looking at gender equality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, again, in red, we have a larger
gender gap, and in green, we have less of
[SPEAKER_00]: a gender gap there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gender gap of one would be in complete
equal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see here the different
countries where there is a greater gender
[SPEAKER_00]: gap, where that is existing, based on 2013
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this gender imbalance is very evident
in China, where it's in 1982, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: ultrasound was widely available.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see now an increase in the number of
males present.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2012, for every 100 girls born,
there were 116 males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this China's gender imbalance
problem, the gap may not look large,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it represents a gender gap of about 34
million women in 2011 there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot more males than there are
females, despite our growing population
[SPEAKER_00]: here overall in the billions is uneven.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are more males than females there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a general population demographic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in Singapore, here, we have a poster
that says one, two, and that's ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal here was to try to limit the
amount of population growth that may
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the picture here, countries by
birth rate, those of the brighter
[SPEAKER_00]: colorations here, we're seeing births per
thousand in population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing a lot higher birth rate in
the countries here of Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the age structure, as I mentioned,
cohort is a group of individuals of the
[SPEAKER_00]: same age with characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Birth rate, or fungency, is the number of
offsprings born in a standard time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That directly relates to the death rate,
or mortality, when we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: populations here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the number of individuals that die in
that same period.
[SPEAKER_00]: The relative number of individuals in each
cohort defines the population's age,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that goes back to the first image we
saw with the bars, where we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the number of individuals of male to
female sex ratio there, how many occur in
[SPEAKER_00]: a particular population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the birth rate is the number of being
born, death rate is the number of dying
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: How these relate to one another will
determine a population's demographics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
