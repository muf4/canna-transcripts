[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we'll look at enzymes,
which are very specific types of proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here in the title slide our
enzyme located the dark gray molecule
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and we have our substrate being
broken down into two end products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, enzymes can break things apart
as well as assemble them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully this will make a little more
sense at the end of this video lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, what are enzymes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, enzymes are helper protein
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all enzymes are proteins, but not all
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: All proteins are enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a disaccharide being broken
apart with enzymes into two
[SPEAKER_00]: monosaccharides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chemical reactions for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enzymes are involved in the building of
molecules or the synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have two independent molecules
taking in energy to form this bond,
[SPEAKER_00]: this synthesized molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the opposite of that would be
breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important we have enzymes as
part of our digestive system to help us
[SPEAKER_00]: release some energy here through our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throughout the digestive process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Activation energy is the minimum amount of
energy that must be present for a chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have reactants producing our
energy level, our end products.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the minimum amount of activation
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the minimum amount of energy we
need to obtain in order to produce our end
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this activation energy can be greatly
reduced in the presence of enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now catalytic converters relate to cars
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So internal combustion engines have
catalysts, which accelerates chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a catalytic converter in the
internal combustion engines.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps speed up the reaction that
occurs to reduce some of the emissions
[SPEAKER_00]: that are produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now mechanisms for enzyme action.
[SPEAKER_00]: The enzyme must bind to the substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Product is formed at a lower activation
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the product will then be released.
[SPEAKER_00]: So enzymes are important proteins for
living things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And enzymes are a protein that changes the
rate of the chemical reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can speed up chemical reactions,
allowing biological functions to occur at
[SPEAKER_00]: a much quicker rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at reduced energy, allowing you to be
able to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great summary slide here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where chemical reactions in living
organisms require enzymes to do work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The enzymes speed up reactions or catalyze
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at this in more
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red line here shows the reactants and
the amount of energy required without
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the activation energy here without
an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's producing the end products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the presence of enzymes,
we see that the amount of activation
[SPEAKER_00]: energy is greatly reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, not only is the energy
reduced, but the time to produce the end
[SPEAKER_00]: products is also reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this example, we have less amount of
energy required and a quicker time to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce the end products.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if we look at the beginning and
the end, we start in the same place and we
[SPEAKER_00]: end up in the same place.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, for biological purposes,
sometimes there could be too much energy
[SPEAKER_00]: required if we didn't have enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we did not have enzymes,
we would not be able to perform the
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary functions for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, again, enzymes are reducing the
activation energy, and in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: also reducing the amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the overall energy released during
the reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that's basically the same with or
without the enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some key vocabulary when we're using
enzymes in these very specific types of
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins are substrates, which are the
molecule the enzyme works on, the end
[SPEAKER_00]: product, which is what the enzyme helps
produce at the end of the reaction,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this active site, which is a very
specific shape, which allows a very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific substrate to bind to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the active site here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be different for every enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: One enzyme cannot bind to a bunch of
different substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can only bind to the same type of
substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of just give you that general
progression of the catalytic cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our active site with our enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have our sucrose, which consists
of glucose and fructose bonded together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a disaccharide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two carbohydrates, two monosaccharides,
two sugars bonded together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This enzyme has a very specific shape for
sucrose, and it's forming this
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme-substrate complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: This binding is occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the substrate enzyme places stresses
on the glucose-fructose bond of that
[SPEAKER_00]: sucrose molecule, and that ultimately will
break the bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing that breaking of the bond
and that product's being released in the
[SPEAKER_00]: form of glucose and fructose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the enzyme now open and able to
bind to another sucrose molecule to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through this process again.
[SPEAKER_00]: See again, kind of shows you just that
general same progression here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, with the enzyme, a lot less energy
required than without the enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enzymes are proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: All enzymes are proteins, but not all
proteins are enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then typically end with the suffix
a-s-e or ace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can help you identify what
substrate it'll break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, lactase breaks down
lactose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maltase breaks down maltose, and so on and
so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amylase breaks down starch, because
amylase is a type of starch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you see all the others, lipase
breaking down lipids, protease breaking
[SPEAKER_00]: down proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of gives you an indication if you're
looking at something that you're not quite
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may help you identify it as a
potential enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may also give you some hint as to what
substrate that breaks down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's that image from the beginning on
the title slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each enzyme is a specific helplock with
a very specific reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each enzyme needs the right shape for the
job, and this is why we need our proteins
[SPEAKER_00]: to have the proper shape to perform the
proper function.
[SPEAKER_00]: This specific enzyme binds to this
specific substrate and is able to break
[SPEAKER_00]: this down into its individual products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of use the concept of a lock and a
key.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very important for the proper
shape to perform the proper function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the shape of protein allows the enzyme
and substrate to fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, a very specific enzyme for
each specific reaction that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also important to remember that these
enzymes are not consumed or changed by the
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only used temporarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be reused again and again for the
same reaction with other molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, your body needs very little
enzymes to help its many reactions that
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're able to bind, break down,
or synthesize and repeat the process again
[SPEAKER_00]: and again and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body doesn't need to go through and
make more enzymes necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: This enzyme is active site.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very small area of the enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our giant enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the actual binding site and our
catalytic site here reduces the chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: activation energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can literally allow these enzymes to
kind of move and break things apart or
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesize them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll come back and to perform that
function again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, changes in proteins environment
can cause the protein to what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: denature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denaturing is losing its three-dimensional
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have our functional protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: We add heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We denature that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This changes the shape and therefore this
protein with this enzyme can no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: perform proper function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shape determines function.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we change the shape, that protein can
very often lose its function in this
[SPEAKER_00]: process of calling.
[SPEAKER_00]: This protein would denature.
Thank you.
