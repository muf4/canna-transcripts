[SPEAKER_00]: Many growers know to look at the trichomes
of their cannabis plant to determine
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest, but many wonder what should they
be actually looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to go over some great images and
[SPEAKER_00]: give you that kind of step-by-step guide
on what to look for in your trichomes to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine your peak harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into understanding
visual cues of cannabis trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: development to maximize harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to monitor the color change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by monitoring the change in color of
the gland heads particularly, the grower
[SPEAKER_00]: can evaluate the ripeness of the flower
pistolet plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using a 30x loop or higher is advised for
some other form of magnification of the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes for close visual inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's important to say that we're
monitoring the color change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this does not mean you just look at
them once and go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great if you look at them in the
early stages when hopefully there'll be a
[SPEAKER_00]: clear coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see they're going to
progress to this cloudy coloration and
[SPEAKER_00]: then ultimately this amber coloration if
they go a little bit far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to see this kind of stage
and progression, but that's the general
[SPEAKER_00]: trend that those trichomes will be going
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off those stages, and this kind
of highlights it here as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: early to middle flowering, resin heads
will be mostly clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this is a great example of a
mostly clear head right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be another one as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the final phases of bloom cycle,
the trichomes will transition from a clear
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of a cloudy milky white color and
eventually turn to an amber color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's that cloudy milky white look
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple here that are in focus
that are showing that kind of cloudiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's kind of one as well, and you can
see there's more, but they're kind of out
[SPEAKER_00]: of focus in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most seasons growers say that time to
harvest is when bulbous heads,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the top portion here,
are cloudy with a few amber ones here and
[SPEAKER_00]: there, about a 70 to 30% mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do those amber ones look like where
they're kind of the most ivy scent
[SPEAKER_00]: coloration change?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see this on this particular
image, it's not like everything changes at
[SPEAKER_00]: once.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see some that are clear, some that are
also in the cloudy stage, some that are
[SPEAKER_00]: also in the amber stage, all in the same
structure here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why it's important to visually
check your plants to see those transitions
[SPEAKER_00]: that are occurring and see that change or
that shift in percentages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do those kind of clear trichomes
kind of look like here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the early stage of development,
the clear color can indicate they're not,
[SPEAKER_00]: quote, full of cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think of the clear color meaning
that they are, quote, empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it doesn't mean that they're
completely empty when they're clear,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just kind of as a visual way to kind
of correlate and remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clear, you can think kind of empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing in there, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, not true from a botanical
standpoint, but that kind of gives a great
[SPEAKER_00]: visual clue of like, oh, it's clear,
it's empty, I can see right through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not looking, there's nothing there to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buds should not be harvested at this time
because at this point, they're basically
[SPEAKER_00]: immature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's before their kind of peak maturity
and they lack the desired compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this doesn't mean you'll be
harvesting when there might be a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: that are still clear, but if the vast
majority are clear, hold off on the
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we get to those cloudy trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see here different degrees of
cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When trichomes start to go from a
transparent to kind of to a translucent
[SPEAKER_00]: transparency, this is the sign that
harvest is getting closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, transparent is being able to
clearly see through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Translucent, we're getting that cloudy
milkiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then opaque would almost be that amber
color where you're kind of blocking the
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cloudy look, growers can think of the
trichome becoming full of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's botanically true,
but here we can see that cloudy
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance, what's giving it the
cloudiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can think of it as being the
cannabinoids that are accumulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step is that opaque kind of amber
color, and it's thought to give,
[SPEAKER_00]: in some cases, to give the energetic high,
even though it may not be fully correlated
[SPEAKER_00]: with the coloration to the after effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that amber coloration kind of
look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we get to those amber-like
heads, they're progressing from that
[SPEAKER_00]: cloudiness to white color of trichomes,
we'll change to the yellow-brown amber
[SPEAKER_00]: color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Waiting for some of the trichomes to go to
this coloration is a good sign that
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest of the cannabinoids can be
maximized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's okay if a few go to this amber
color, let people think, oh, it's too
[SPEAKER_00]: late.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay if a few go to that,
it's a sign to get the vast majority in
[SPEAKER_00]: that milky white coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if nearly all the trichomes are
this color at harvest, this may mean peak
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest was kind of missed, leading to
some degradation of the internal
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's thought to give a body high with some
people, but here we're seeing a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: amber, and that's perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sign probably getting right close
to that peak harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that mixed trichomes, as I mentioned,
they all don't turn necessarily in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same day, the same flip of a switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since all the trichomes will not change
from cloudy to amber at the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be best to aim for a mixed
coloration to determine your exact harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the exact percentage of cloudy and
amber may be impacted by a variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: state of development, and your kind of
ability of timing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we have that kind of mix here,
we do see some that are kind of clear,
[SPEAKER_00]: some that are cloudy, some that are amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to kind of make a judgment call as
far as when we're going to determine that
[SPEAKER_00]: peak harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually when they try trichomes are a
mix of the colorations that I described
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, kind of that general summary,
if you want kind of that kind of sectioned
[SPEAKER_00]: out this picture here, want that general
summary of clear, cloudy or amber heads,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can look at that kind of general
summary image here, as well as going back
[SPEAKER_00]: through some of the other images on the
slides to help you determine when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at your cannabis plants,
the exact peak of harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're maximizing the cannabinoids and
terpenes produced without getting into any
[SPEAKER_00]: loss due to overripeness or damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this tobacco university video
was helpful in determining your peak
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest and maximizing your harvest as
well.
Thank you.
