[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a student series where we'll learn
about ratchet light hanging 101 for
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick note, keep in mind that these
are sold in pairs and the weight that they
[SPEAKER_01]: can support is for the pair, not the
individual hanger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, let's get into the video as
part of this Tobacco University student
[SPEAKER_01]: series.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our ratchet strap 101 for
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a pretty basic ratchet strap.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't differ too much, as you can
see, pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, however, you pull up on this
little lever and you could adjust it
[SPEAKER_00]: accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would hang it up by this clip onto
whatever structure you have available,
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to hang your lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this one, it's a little different,
but simpler, where you just press this
[SPEAKER_00]: button and adjust accordingly based to
what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when it comes to actually adjusting
the light, you're going to want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that you have a hand to support it
underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the most important step because if
you are to start adjusting this while
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting this heavy light, it could fall
and ruin your entire operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could break your lights or your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just want to make sure if you're
going to do any adjusting, to these,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have a good support underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the good thing about ratchet straps
is that they're adjustable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're versatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have an issue like this where
a hanger isn't big enough, like this one,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't matter because you can level it
out accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the good thing about ratchet
straps.
Thanks for watching.
