[SPEAKER_00]: On this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to go over understanding watts,
[SPEAKER_00]: volts, and amps for cannabis production in
relation to utilizing grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you think it's as easy as plugging a
light in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go over and understanding some of
the watts, volts, and amps that you might
[SPEAKER_00]: have in your grow lights so you can be
efficient with your production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, amps, looking at the
generalness here of the amps refers to the
[SPEAKER_00]: flow of the current.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it as the flow of water in a
pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flow rate of amps will determine the
available amount of electricity to the
[SPEAKER_00]: electrical system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of available amps determines
the amount of lights that can be operated
[SPEAKER_00]: at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very important if you're in a larger grow
area to know how many amps can you supply?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many grow lights can you support for
your area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers need to know what amp service they
have available and also what electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: appliances they have in addition to the
grow room light.
[SPEAKER_00]: To know how many lights can be safely
supported if a system upgrade is needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we think about our lights,
and that is an important consideration,
[SPEAKER_00]: do we have any water pumps also to
consider?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have any other things that are
consuming electricity that we need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: aware of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just think about the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have humidifier, dehumidifier,
water pumps, all sorts of other things
[SPEAKER_00]: that may require electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have extra amps already for a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that if whatever your
system is, you don't want to push your
[SPEAKER_00]: electrical system to the max.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, while a thousand watt light
operating at 120 volts requires 8.3 amps,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers should allow and calculate as if
it was consuming 10 amps, as this will
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the chance of system overload and
increase the reliability of the electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might be familiar with your panels
here, knowing how many amps, knowing where
[SPEAKER_00]: the circuits are.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's kind of the rule of thumb when you
go through and calculating this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in general, when calculating for a
thousand watt grow light, 120 volt circuit
[SPEAKER_00]: uses 10 amps, 240 uses about five amps,
it'd be about half the total of amps as
[SPEAKER_00]: the volts there double.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also operating any circuit at 80% of
capacity is a good idea in the sense that
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll reduce the chance of burning
anything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll allow some wiggle room in case
there's increased amount of energy
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption at initial startup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's just always good to plan
and play it on the safe side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't push it to the absolute theoretical
max.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've mentioned volts there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about them a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Volts does relate to amps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the higher the voltage, the less amps
that are needed to operate the device,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it does not mean they will cost less
to operate, common misconception.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the operating voltage is increased,
the number of amps or the current will
[SPEAKER_00]: also decrease, but the amount of power or
watts required will remain the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is often kind of this
misnomer there of should I go run on 140
[SPEAKER_00]: volts or 240 volts?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I run it in 240, I'm consuming less
amps, as we can see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm running it in 120 volts,
10 amps, 240, oh, only five.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind the wattage, still a
thousand watt light in this example would
[SPEAKER_00]: still be the same, and that's what you're
charged with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, running one versus another is
not going to reduce any sort of cost when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at energy consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mentioning those watts here,
watts does refer to the power needed or
[SPEAKER_00]: used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most growers would calculate their growing
space and then determine the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: watts needed to sufficiently light that
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: To provide 50 watts per square foot over a
10 by 10 area, the grower would need to
[SPEAKER_00]: supply about a thousand watts of lighting,
just to give you one little math kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: quick comparison there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're comparing watts efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of where it comes into,
you know, a lot of the new lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of lights are stating their
efficiency, which is a great thing for
[SPEAKER_00]: growers to be able to compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watts can also be used to determine the
gross base overall efficiency,
[SPEAKER_00]: as many growers will talk in grams per
watt produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: To compare different lighting options,
the lighting efficiency in terms of PAR,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is again, photosynthetically active
radiation per watt is often used since
[SPEAKER_00]: this offers an effective way to compare
the efficiency of different lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only looking at the lighting,
but looking at the bulbs used,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the type or style of lighting,
looking at the reflector being used,
[SPEAKER_00]: what type of grow area, do other walls or
their grow tent walls or mylar walls or
[SPEAKER_00]: the lenses being used and what the power
supply is.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these can have an impact there on
the total watts use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's the volt scenarios?
[SPEAKER_00]: If a grower has a thousand watt grow
light, situation one grower has 120 volt
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will need 8.3 amps to support this
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the grower has a 240 volt system,
they only need half of that or 4.16 amps
[SPEAKER_00]: to support that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's important to keep that in
mind that the volts can impact the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of amps that are needed, but essentially
in the end, you're looking at a very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar watt consumption and that's
usually what you're charged with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not gonna reduce your overall
cost and make sure you buy the right,
[SPEAKER_00]: you purchase the right light for your
electrical service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now 120 or 240 volts, this gets again,
a lot of attention here of which one's
[SPEAKER_00]: better, which one should I choose?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one reduces my amps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when operating grow room on 240 volts,
you can operate twice as many lights on
[SPEAKER_00]: the same amperage than if you're operating
on 120 volts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically larger operations will stick
with the 240 volts.
[SPEAKER_00]: With either voltage, the lighting system
will still require that thousand watts or
[SPEAKER_00]: power.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially both voltages will cost the
same to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 240 usually allows growers to run a
few more lights there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind, you just can't buy one
and decide you're gonna flip the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different outlets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the manufacturers come to a consensus
to make it easier to prevent people from
[SPEAKER_00]: plugging the wrong light into the wrong
socket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that there's different
shapes to the outlets to prevent you from
[SPEAKER_00]: making that mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now watt hours, so a company's bills based
on the watts, so different voltages do not
[SPEAKER_00]: save money directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind that just
because you're using less amperage does
[SPEAKER_00]: not mean it's gonna cost you less to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the appliance wattage versus the
operating time in hours versus the watts
[SPEAKER_00]: used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So little calculations here that you can
apply to your own specific lights that you
[SPEAKER_00]: might be using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when comparing watts, lights and volts,
there are these mathematical equations
[SPEAKER_00]: just provide you with a couple,
kind of the triangle here is very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of provides you with the same
information here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watts divided by volts is amps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watts divided by amps is volts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watts equals volts times amps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just a little comparison there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanted to go ahead and do some
independent calculations for your own
[SPEAKER_00]: specific grid, for your own conditions,
this is the information you would go to.
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
