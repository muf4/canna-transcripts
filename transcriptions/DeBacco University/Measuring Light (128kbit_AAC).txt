[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to talk about measuring
light and some of the units that you may
[SPEAKER_00]: see stated and what those kind of mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's just one example here of a handheld
parameter to measure light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I included a link to the
fundamentals of light kind of summit
[SPEAKER_00]: lecture I located on YouTube if you want
to take a look at that also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, you may hear the term lumens
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lumen is a measure of the total
quality of visible light emitted by a
[SPEAKER_00]: source.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this has greater ties to the
human visible spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of the cliched term here is lumens
are for humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that may look bright to our eye
may not necessarily be bright or produce
[SPEAKER_00]: something that is also beneficial to
plants in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So PAR, or Photosynthetic Active
Radiation, this is a measure of the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of light in the 400 to 700 nanometers,
which is where a plant needs to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 400 to 700 nanometers,
kind of that full visible light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher the PAR rating, the more
efficient the plant will be since it
[SPEAKER_00]: measures the type of light needed for this
photosynthetic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important to keep in mind that this
PAR is a better measurement than lumens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, PFF, or Photosynthetic Photon Flux,
is how many photons are being released
[SPEAKER_00]: from a light source every second.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unit typically uses micromoles per
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is limiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't tell you how much of the
measured light actually lands in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, but it's an important metric if
you want to calculate the efficiency of
[SPEAKER_00]: the lighting system is at creating light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have the example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see how this light is scattered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how I'm going to play under this
light, a lot of this scattered light will
[SPEAKER_00]: be part of the PFF, the Photosynthetic
Photon Flux, being released, the photons
[SPEAKER_00]: released from this light, but it's not
going to be taken up by the plant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of this, for example, will be
wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's PPFD, Photosynthetic Photon Flux
Density, and this is how many photons are
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very important measure and
one you should look for if you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at comparing light sites or trying to get
information from a manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a spot measurement, so it's
important to take an average of several
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFDs measurements for the defined height
that are taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micromoles per meter squared per second is
often the unit used.
[SPEAKER_00]: The limitation is this can overstate the
true light intensities of the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see published average PPFDs
over a growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want just a spot measurement,
you want to see it over an area,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that will tell you, again,
the Photon Flux Density, the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: light actually hitting your plant so it
actually can be absorbed and used by the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measuring light with PAR meters,
sensors are primary instruments used to
[SPEAKER_00]: qualify these light intensities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to test your light,
allow it to warm up for at least five
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes or so before doing any intensity
of the light readings, just making sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting an accurate reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: These sensors work by an optical filter to
create a uniform sensitivity for PAR
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: A light meter measures instantaneous light
intensities, or data loggers to measure a
[SPEAKER_00]: cumulative light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, be careful what light meter you may
be using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it's best matched for your light
source that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have choices between kind of
artificial sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have ways to measure the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are limited for LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are better for high-pressure sodiums.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just be mindful of which one
that you're using and realize its
[SPEAKER_00]: limitations and what it's best for.
