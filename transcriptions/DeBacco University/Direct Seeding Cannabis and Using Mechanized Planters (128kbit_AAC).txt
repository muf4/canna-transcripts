[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video,
where we're going to be looking at direct
[SPEAKER_00]: seeding cannabis and using mechanized
planters for cannabis growing at a large
[SPEAKER_00]: scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while this will be a talk specifically
on cannabis, this has been used for many
[SPEAKER_00]: other crops, just here applying it to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the video here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we have to consider
germination and just the basics of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the sense that you're getting a seed
from a certified source, keeping that
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature in the upper 70s to low 80s
Fahrenheit, mid 20s to upper 20s degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius, moisture level around 90%
relative humidity, air roots and plants
[SPEAKER_00]: still need to breathe and respire,
so about 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Planting depth, you only want about an
eighth to quarter of an inch deep or three
[SPEAKER_00]: millimeters to six millimeters deep,
and light 150, 300 par reading,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly if you're growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors, if you don't have a choice,
they'll have to toughen up relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, timing of planting, you want it to
ideally match ideal conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put ideal conditions there in quotes
because while the weather cannot be
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled, trying to time the planting
around when it may be similar to ideal
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions will help ensure maximum chance
of a good field stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to knowingly plant all of
your plants in conditions that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: favorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that does happen, but at least
you want to put the odds in your favor
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at weather data, looking at timing
of year, so hopefully you can time it with
[SPEAKER_00]: a good weather pattern that you might be
experiencing in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So springtime, so while planting dates can
partially be determined by weather,
[SPEAKER_00]: however, knowing what type of cannabis
category you're using will influence your
[SPEAKER_00]: decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, using auto flowers, you want to try
to select the most ideal 70 days of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season for outdoor production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing a photo period
dependent, you want to be mindful of when
[SPEAKER_00]: the photo period will change to know how
long your plants will stay in veg before
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally going into flower through the
natural pattern of reducing the light or
[SPEAKER_00]: light duration that your plants will be
experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, utilizing feminized seeds,
so when seeding a field to avoid half the
[SPEAKER_00]: field being essentially wasted by
producing male plants, you typically want
[SPEAKER_00]: to start with a feminized seed is highly
recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers may choose clones,
but here we're focusing on looking at if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're starting with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Realize if you're using feminized seeds
and if the seed is 99% female or
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized, this means one out of 100
plants will be male on average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's close enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: One out of 100 on average will be a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a reminder, 99% is not 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there's one out of 100 on average
being male, this means if you grow 6,000
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and typically field plantings are
quite large using feminized seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: there will be still 60 male plants in a
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So scouting and colonies is still a
necessary process because having 60 males
[SPEAKER_00]: in a planting of 6,000 might be enough to
produce quite a number of seeds and reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: your overall cannabinoid production.
[SPEAKER_00]: When using mechanized planters,
so the size consistency is important to
[SPEAKER_00]: help reduce the chance of having skips or
doubles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on your seeding equipment,
there might be computers to help keep
[SPEAKER_00]: track of the skips or doubles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skips is where that seed doesn't get
planted and doubles is where two gets
[SPEAKER_00]: planted where one should.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this might take some time to kind of
dial in your equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, once dialed in, the method can be
very efficient, but be sure to take into
[SPEAKER_00]: account your soil conditions, particularly
on the day that you're planting or also if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going from field to field,
how conditions may change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The field preparations are a critical part
of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So consistent conditions will aid in the
formation of an even stand or referred to
[SPEAKER_00]: as plant emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're mechanizedly planting the actual
seeds, be sure the field is ready for the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in advance of planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be seeds or even looking at
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, the preparations can be
done soon before planting or even just
[SPEAKER_00]: before planting to limit your trips in the
field and the cost of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going to look at an example
of a field has been mechanized planted
[SPEAKER_00]: with small recently emerged seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get an idea of how this
actually looks on an actual cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This shows a large scale hemp production
field with its drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis plants spaced about every three
feet, drip lines, emitters are every one
[SPEAKER_01]: foot approximately.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see just the size or scalability
of this type of system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
