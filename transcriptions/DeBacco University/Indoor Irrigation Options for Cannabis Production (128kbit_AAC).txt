[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tabaco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing plants indoors and
wondering how you can irrigate them or
[SPEAKER_00]: what options you have, this is the video
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into indoor
irrigation options for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, you have to determine if the
plant needs water by lifting the
[SPEAKER_00]: containers usually to gauge the water
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is simply lifting the containers,
particularly if you're growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: containers, it's better to use sometimes
than meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meters can be used as a backup,
but getting that literal feel of your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants yourself is probably the best
method, especially early on to determine
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not they should be watering
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when to fertilize?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, fertilized water should be added
each time you water your plants with low
[SPEAKER_00]: doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to have these low dose and
feed each and every day to allow plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain consistent growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers will choose to do maybe a six
day and the seventh day, they kind of do a
[SPEAKER_00]: freshwater flush, but the key part here is
getting away from once a week fertilizing
[SPEAKER_00]: to every day, but lower the dose down to
just providing that little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent feed to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, irrigation in general is defined as
the process of applying controlled amounts
[SPEAKER_00]: of water to plants at needed intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: How the water is delivered is really up to
the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, the plant's performance will not
differ among different irrigation systems
[SPEAKER_00]: if each is performed correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's important to know the
options because there really isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily one best option and that's the
reason why there are options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each method does have its own set of
advantages and disadvantages, which is why
[SPEAKER_00]: growers need to select the best fit for
their operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one option would be basically growing
hydroponically and the advantage is it can
[SPEAKER_00]: really allow for maximum yields and it's
used a lot in the lettuce industry as we
[SPEAKER_00]: see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages to this method
is that there's a smaller margin for error
[SPEAKER_00]: when compared to buffered substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swings in pH, for example, can occur very
rapidly in hydroponic setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is hand watering and that's the
advantage that allows for very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to plant care.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one plant needs a little bit more,
you can give it a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: One needs a little bit less, you can give
it a little bit less.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantage is that this is
very time consuming and plants can be
[SPEAKER_00]: missed, especially if you're growing a lot
of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the flood and drain or the
ebb and flow method and the advantage is
[SPEAKER_00]: that this offers even watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a table here that floods
and drains.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows also for the aeration of the
root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages are the initial
cost and setup of equipment as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining the equipment and keeping it
clean from cycle to cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have indoor drip irrigation and
the advantage is that this is very easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: automate and offers plant specific
watering because you can add these little
[SPEAKER_00]: emitters to individual plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantages, of course, the initial
cost and setup of equipment and also
[SPEAKER_00]: continually checking to ensure all tubing,
tubes and fittings are all functioning and
[SPEAKER_00]: working properly, making sure filters
aren't getting clogged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then lastly, we have aeroponics and the
advantage of aeroponics is that this
[SPEAKER_00]: allows for efficient at delivering
nutrients to the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also allows for easy visual inspection
of the root structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is that this is dependent
on electricity and can become less
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient when dense roots are formed as
far as dependent on the exact setup that
[SPEAKER_00]: you may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this offers some options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out this channel for more details on
each of these options for indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation of your cannabis plants.
