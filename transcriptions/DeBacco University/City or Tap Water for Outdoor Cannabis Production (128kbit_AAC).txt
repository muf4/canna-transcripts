[SPEAKER_00]: Are you considering using city or tap
water for outdoor cannabis production?
[SPEAKER_00]: This Tobacco University video will provide
you with some good information as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: what you should be looking for and be
aware of when using this type of water
[SPEAKER_00]: source.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into using city or
tap water for outdoor cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, you need to test the base
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what the source you're using,
you need to have an idea what the base
[SPEAKER_00]: source has for a starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can include the parts per million,
the AC, the pH, the temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: on which all can be very easily determined
with a quality water meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifics for city water though include
what type of antimicrobial is being
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially added to that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it chlorine, fluorine, chloramide,
or other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely things to be considerate of
when you're talking about city or tap
[SPEAKER_00]: water, also sometimes called drinking
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some tests available here that
we can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why is chlorine used?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very common additive added to
city or tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorine is a cheap disinfectant that is
effective at removing microorganisms,
[SPEAKER_00]: infections, protozoans that can develop in
the water supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why it's added for these
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good thing that it's added.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be mindful of this if we're
looking at irrigating plants or
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially using a supportive microbe
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the change from chlorine to chloramine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that's being used in a
lot of towns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to understand if your
municipality is making this change or has
[SPEAKER_00]: made this change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chloramine is more stable, although it is
a weaker disinfectant than chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chloramine is ammonia added to drinking
water containing chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see a picture of that kind of
molecule right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, this does stay in the water
much longer for a much longer duration of
[SPEAKER_00]: time than chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chloramine levels of up to four milligrams
per liter or four part per million are
[SPEAKER_00]: safe for drinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be aware that there are safe
levels of this particular kind of additive
[SPEAKER_00]: that's being put into many of the drinking
water supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we're filtering chlorine,
this goes back to chlorine, is typically
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at what's called an activated
carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: These carbon filters are some of the most
effective tools that we use in chlorine
[SPEAKER_00]: content from water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also common in households since
these filters can also improve the general
[SPEAKER_00]: taste and odor associated with chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: People just tend not to like to drink
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the most common type of carbon filter
is actually a activated carbon filter,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This effectively reduces and also filters
many contaminants and unwanted components
[SPEAKER_00]: from the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why they are so commonly seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we have filtering chlorine with
catalytic carbon, so a different kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is less common.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a more advanced form of carbon
filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called catalytic activated carbon
filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This process has a higher capacity for
chlorine reduction and can effectively
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce chloramines as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that just because,
oh, it's a carbon filter, we should try to
[SPEAKER_00]: find out a little bit more of the
specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why one may cost more than
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're filtering out that chlorine
again, focusing on that in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will use faucet-mounted
filtration systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an activated charcoal filter
to treat tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not advised simply because
they're small size and rate, which the
[SPEAKER_00]: water is emitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That water typically will mean it's
restricted in a way that will not allow
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficient irrigation to plants,
particularly on even a mid-size scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both due to these factors, it means the
less chlorine is filtered out than with an
[SPEAKER_00]: activated carbon filter used in more
comprehensive and large filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind not only will the flow
rate be reduced, but because these are so
[SPEAKER_00]: small, the amount of chlorine they're
removing is also reduced, which kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: negates the point you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, filtering out chloramine,
we talked about earlier, this filtration
[SPEAKER_00]: technique is expensive versus the ones we
had just heard about here for chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: To remove chloramine, you need an
expensive carbon filter to remove the
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorine included in the chloramine
molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to utilize ideally reverse
osmosis or a cation filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will remove the ammonia content
within the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see here more complex,
more components, potentially longer
[SPEAKER_00]: duration of time to filter, so in more
moving parts or more components to be
[SPEAKER_00]: considering changing out or hopefully not
having any leaky fittings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of growers will combine and use
multiple systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while the overall flow rate of water
may be reduced combining multiple systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: this can help ensure all particulate
chemicals and organisms are removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This often is utilized with a storage tank
of some kind simply because the flow rate
[SPEAKER_00]: is often too slow to be used for
irrigation directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure this system is sized or
potentially oversized for your current
[SPEAKER_00]: operation to ensure there's enough water
for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oversizing it will allow you the
chance to potentially grow more plants or
[SPEAKER_00]: just have more water on hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can just see a mock example here of
a water softener, carbon takes,
[SPEAKER_00]: an RO system, and then a storage tank kind
of all utilized in the same area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to keep in mind that
there can be a lot of components,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a lot of this depends on what your
starting water actually has.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doing that initial test is very
important because it will help direct you
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as what system you might want to
consider utilizing for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
