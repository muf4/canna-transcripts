[SPEAKER_00]: Here on Tobacco University, I'm going to
provide a brief overview of reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: osmosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at reverse osmosis use for
cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off the basics of the reverse
osmosis system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, reverse osmosis is a filtration
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a method that can remove up to 95 to
99% of dissolved salts in any water
[SPEAKER_00]: sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result is the most common option for
desalinating water on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reverse osmosis uses high pressure to
force water through a semi-permeable
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane which results in salts on one
side of the membrane and pure water on the
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we can see here, normal osmosis
would have water kind of working its way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure water would go try to dissolve the
contaminants or salt particles here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reverse osmosis has a same semi-permeable
membrane but takes applied pressure and
[SPEAKER_00]: forces that water going backwards,
the reverse process, and squeezes the
[SPEAKER_00]: water if you want to think about it that
way through this semi-permeable membrane
[SPEAKER_00]: only allowing pure water to come out at
this far end.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this process can be wasteful if
access to water is limited because there
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be kind of a bypass of water with
the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's typically a six to one ratio with
six parts being fed into the system for
[SPEAKER_00]: every one part of pure water that is
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it can is great producing pure
water can be a little wasteful in that six
[SPEAKER_00]: to one ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep that in mind if water is a
very limited resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you want to remove minerals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, RO water, reverse osmosis water,
will essentially have no minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows growers to now control what is
added to the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If RO water is fed directly to plants then
calcium and magnesium deficiency is
[SPEAKER_00]: likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why we have water starting
with basically nothing is that allows
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever part per million you're trying to
desire can be all of the elements or
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients that you're looking to add to
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you already have high part per million
water it's going to limit the amount that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can add to make sure your plants are
properly fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reverse osmosis process in very quick
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's typically a three or four stage
kind of filtration process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically that first stage is a sediment
filter simply because we don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: clog any of the downstream components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the important carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the impurities are removed
and then we have a post carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are two carbon filters a pre and
a post and there can be multiple stages of
[SPEAKER_00]: these filtrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole goal here again is to produce
that pure water as close to that pure
[SPEAKER_00]: water as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But reminder that there is that six to one
ratio of lost water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to have a way to kind of drain
out that waste water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not harmful water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just through the reverse osmosis
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's need to kind of flush the system
continually to ensure you're producing
[SPEAKER_00]: that as close to possible zero EC or zero
part per million end result water.
