[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
we're going to be looking at some research
[SPEAKER_00]: presented by the University of Vermont
Extension, looking at hemp cannabidiol
[SPEAKER_00]: drying trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you can follow along and
learn some information here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: research presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you want to learn about it in
more detail, links will be provided in the
[SPEAKER_00]: video so you can look at the full trial
and its full details if you so choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the drying
temperature effect on CBD content of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis based on the UVM data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the University of Vermont
Extension here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking for the actual
original publication, this is the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: link here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll provide with a brief overview in this
video lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, dryer temperature,
humidity, and harvest moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at some of the data
presented and at harvest, the moisture of
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower buds was statistically similar,
which generally would make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average actual temperature and
relative humidity for each treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: indicated that the 105 Fahrenheit
treatment dryer with the buds did not
[SPEAKER_00]: reach 105 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look here at the data, actual
temperature, we could see that they had it
[SPEAKER_00]: set for 105 degrees Fahrenheit,
but only got it up to 86.4 was the average
[SPEAKER_00]: actual temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did note in the research they had
some issues with this particular drying
[SPEAKER_00]: oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was unclear why the dryer was unable to
maintain a consistent temperature over the
[SPEAKER_00]: drying period.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what happens in science.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dryer had an average temperature that
was only seven degrees higher than the
[SPEAKER_00]: drying treatment at 80 degrees Fahrenheit
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something went wrong with that
particular dryer, but does not mean all
[SPEAKER_00]: the data here is null and void.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually some usable data here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When drying the bud and stems,
this is bud and stems, at 105 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit, dryer did not reach its
average temperature until after seven
[SPEAKER_00]: hours and fluctuated the most in
temperature in the first three hours as it
[SPEAKER_00]: warmed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although after the first seven hours it
remained more consistent temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another important kind of data
point information to provide in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: that it does take some time to warm up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And initially it might be some more
fluctuations here that growers need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the 80 degree dryer did not have
this problem and temperatures neared 80
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Fahrenheit right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just something with these warmer
temperatures, they noted the changes
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's also important in
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: To kind of document what happens,
even though it may not go as intended to
[SPEAKER_00]: document that, just so you have a better
understanding of the data when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also have the average relative
humidity presented and the harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture presented here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hourly bud only temperature and
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were looking at the buds only and
then the buds and the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hourly temperature and relative
humidity is for the buds only experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have the temperature in Fahrenheit
and then we have the time here and we have
[SPEAKER_00]: the different colors shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extending out we could see that there's an
overall decrease in the ambient relative
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity over the time, ambient
temperature and the 80 degree Fahrenheit
[SPEAKER_00]: dryer humidity and temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the humidity, here's the
temperature, very consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's the temperature for 105
and the relative humidity here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can definitely see based on our data
points that the 105 dryer relative
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity decreased to a much greater level
there as the temperature came down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, relative humidity is here,
temperature is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that relative humidity definitely came
down quicker at the 105 degrees compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to the 80 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that necessarily better?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see later, but that's at least a
quick overview of what this data table is
[SPEAKER_00]: showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they looked at the hourly bud and
stem temperature related to relative
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bud and stem experiment,
average dryer temperature were approximate
[SPEAKER_00]: to the desired temperatures and the hourly
temperatures and humidities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here we're seeing temperature
here, very consistent at 80, temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: for 105.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd expect it to be somewhere right
around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see it did fluctuate a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the relative humidity here of the 80
degree temperature decreased and 105
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely decreased much quicker here in
relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at the total
potential CBD here, looking at the data
[SPEAKER_00]: table presented, we have the treatment,
the buds only potential CBD, buds in stem
[SPEAKER_00]: potential and then trial total potential
CBD percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the buds only study, keep in mind
this is the buds only column right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ambient temperature resulted in
significantly higher total potential CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: than drying buds at 105 degrees
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a 7.71 percentage compared
to only a 5.88 percentage point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The total potential CBD of the buds dried
at 80 degrees Fahrenheit did not
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly differ from the higher and
lower temperature treatments and resulted
[SPEAKER_00]: in CBD percentages between the two
extremes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the ambient temperature and then
here's 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little bit less, but not majorly
less, even when they looked at the stats.
[SPEAKER_00]: When drying bud and stem materials,
looking at this column here, there was no
[SPEAKER_00]: significant difference between the CBD
concentrations of 105 and 80 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an important little note there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this study should be repeated because
of the issues that they had with the
[SPEAKER_00]: dryers maintaining consistent
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just keep that in mind there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are noticing some initial data that
there could be differences here in those
[SPEAKER_00]: with the different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of gets into the speed versus
quality kind of concept or idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the use of higher temperatures
resulted in faster drying times,
[SPEAKER_00]: we saw the graph, impact of drying
temperatures on the quality of their
[SPEAKER_00]: product should be taken into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this trial, drying at a higher
temperature above 80 degrees Fahrenheit
[SPEAKER_00]: resulted in significantly lower total
potential CBD concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to remember that this is
only one year of data, limited
[SPEAKER_00]: replications and drying capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Further research is needed in this trial
should be replicated with dryers that are
[SPEAKER_00]: more accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it gets into the concept of speed
versus quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: The faster you go, the less quality you
might be getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, at speed versus quality,
something to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the data here, ambient or 80
degrees Fahrenheit would be kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't want to go much more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it might quicken up the
speeding, the process of the drying,
[SPEAKER_00]: speed up the drying process, you don't
want to sacrifice your quality that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: been trying to grow and perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the entire growing season at the
very end, just to make the drying times
[SPEAKER_00]: less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just some data here to support
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you're looking at 80 degrees or less,
really trying probably for that more 60
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Fahrenheit would be the quality
target.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going much more than that, yeah,
it'll dry faster, but at the risk to
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
Thank you.
