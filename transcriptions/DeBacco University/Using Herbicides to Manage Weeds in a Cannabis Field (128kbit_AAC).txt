[SPEAKER_00]: As the name implies, herbicides are used
to manage weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So utilizing them in a large field or even
a small scale is an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be mindful and cautious of how
to best utilize them if it's an option
[SPEAKER_00]: that we are considering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here on Tobacco University, we're going to
provide you with some information about
[SPEAKER_00]: using herbicides to manage weeds in a
cannabis field.
[SPEAKER_00]: With any method of weed control,
you should research it fully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, if you're considering herbicides,
we're going to get into some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: specifics here and relate it to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, you always want to check
with your current state laws and your
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure what you're looking at is also
current for the growing year, because just
[SPEAKER_00]: as it was current last year doesn't mean
it's going to be current this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be mindful of that you're
finding the current laws and regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I provided a link here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecticut has provided some guidance
relating to assortment of pesticides for
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp and medical marijuana production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can be used as a guide if you're
not from Connecticut to kind of get an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of what some options may be or what
some of the rules, laws and regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: may look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, often this is a limited list when it
regards to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common active ingredients incur a few
listed here, maybe some name brands that
[SPEAKER_00]: you might be familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Avenger very commonly used for it
because it is OMRI certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: For most weeds, grasses and broad leaves,
you can use 20% vinegar, citric acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: corn gluten.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of options, but it might
be a limited list compared to what some
[SPEAKER_00]: other chemicals that might be implemented
or utilized in other production methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, herbicides cautions just in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what weed or weed species are the
main target.
[SPEAKER_00]: To say I want an herbicide to kill
everything, maybe you're trying to target
[SPEAKER_00]: a particular weed species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch for potential drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: The finer the droplets made, the further
they will travel in wind events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physically, a physical spray barrier is
great when row applying, especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's crops present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind also of any signage you may
have to be posting, as well as the wind
[SPEAKER_00]: and timing of your application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure you have different nozzles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking especially at a large
scale, make sure your pressure's
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all just general things from
spraying anything, but in particular with
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at herbicides,
we're looking also at when is it,
[SPEAKER_00]: quote, rain fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we say rain fast, that means
stuck to the actual leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important particularly for outdoor
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might have dew coming in or rain
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, a hot and dry morning is the
best application time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plant will be kind of,
the weeds plant will be trying to grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more aggressively, and that may
make your herbicide application more
[SPEAKER_00]: effective, and also the rain fast time
will allow it to adhere to the leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: bind to the leaf, and reduce the chance of
it running off.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some common products here,
you can see a whole list in the hours
[SPEAKER_00]: until rain fast, some taking six to eight
hours, some rain fast, and basically one
[SPEAKER_00]: or potentially less than one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just a little comparison here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know a particular product you're
using, how many hours until it's rain fast
[SPEAKER_00]: here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that you want to play the line,
but just good information to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in regards to cannabis production,
even if you consider using herbicides and
[SPEAKER_00]: they are permitted, you want to limit
spraying to early part of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: development, particularly the veg side of
the growing cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to avoid late season
applications, as this could easily cause
[SPEAKER_00]: it to enter the plant and show up in
potential quality tests, causing your end
[SPEAKER_00]: product to potentially fail inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you are using herbicides,
even if they are approved, favor applying
[SPEAKER_00]: them early in the season to reduce the
chance of your end product failing any
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last one, we're looking at herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where would we utilize them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're commonly used to prevent
weeds from growing up fences.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also commonly used to prevent
shortening of electrical fences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this example or this case,
this might be far from your actual plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is why it's important to be
concerned of potential for drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you're not applying them next
to or in row, this is another very common
[SPEAKER_00]: application of where they're made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be mindful of drift and potential
barriers or distances you need to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly with growing up fences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing cannabis.
