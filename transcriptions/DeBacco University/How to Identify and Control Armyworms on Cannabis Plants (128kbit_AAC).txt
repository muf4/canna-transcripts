[SPEAKER_00]: As the title implies on this Tobacco
University video, we're going to learn how
[SPEAKER_00]: to identify and control armyworms in
cannabis plants as well as at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing one actively feeding on a cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into how to identify
and control armyworms on cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off the general description of
the armyworm.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at the armyworm,
there's yellow striped armyworms as we can
[SPEAKER_00]: see in the above pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the one of the largest,
this is one of the largest and most
[SPEAKER_00]: brightly marked of various caterpillars
that might be found on hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is then also down here the beet
armyworm.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a caterpillar that feeds on leaves
and developing flowers, fruits,
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds of a great many plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see the one pictured later
of the yellow striped armyworm variety
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very distinctive coloration and very
aggressive feeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the adult stage should be on the
lookout for that as well as part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: general life cycle looking at armyworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at the identification of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a generalist feeder that feeds on
the leaves of a wide variety of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not specific just to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows the adult beet armyworm kind of
moth and this shows the beet armyworm
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding on a hemp flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, very different coloration than
the yellow striped one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now managing armyworms in general,
here's that yellow striped one,
[SPEAKER_00]: cultural controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corn can be planted as a trap crop that
will attract them to that and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: spray and control them on the corn and
hopefully they'll avoid feeding on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tillage, since overwintering occurs in
local soils as a pupate, tilling will help
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy them and reduce their population
pressure for the following year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's also biological controls
which is the use of egg parasitoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's biofungus that can, especially
particular strains that can really attack
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as a last resort, typically
there's insecticides, bioeferrin as the
[SPEAKER_00]: active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you want to know just how quick
these can feed on a cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: I captured some video of them actually
feeding on a leaf and you can welcome to
[SPEAKER_00]: view that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, in this video we see an
armyworm eating a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the audio is not necessarily true to
the actual what's going on, but we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: in real time just how aggressive one of
these caterpillars can basically be.
[SPEAKER_00]: These worms are how quick they can eat and
devour a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here really close to the buds,
so that's of course of concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually where there's one,
while none pictured in the image here,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's a few more and this
implements more scouting as well as control.
