[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University student series
video, we're going to look at properly
[SPEAKER_00]: taking clones from outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple things to keep in mind
that while this can be done at any point
[SPEAKER_00]: during the day or night, times of low
light are advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see the video going
forward, taking right as the sun was
[SPEAKER_00]: setting, as the sun intensity was coming
off the plants, reducing the stress to
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also going to see the difference
between taking a branch clone and a
[SPEAKER_00]: Maristem clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main difference is you've got your
main stock, the branch clone is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be cloning one of those plant materials
that comes directly off that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you take a Maristem clone,
what you're doing is you're cutting out a
[SPEAKER_00]: node in the hopes of encouraging two more
branches to form there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it allows you to take more clones later
as the plant develops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you enjoyed this series and
you can see the comparison between the two
[SPEAKER_00]: and it improves your own success when
you're looking through and cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm going to be showing you how to
take the actual clone from a cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, you're going to want to pick the
plant you want to clone from.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a cherry wine CBG plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next, you're going to want to go into the
plant and try to pick out a specific
[SPEAKER_02]: branch that you want to cut out to become
the clone in your cloner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I decided to go with this branch right
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly because of its morphology,
you can see that it's about a hand's
[SPEAKER_02]: length long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, that's subject to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: So depending on how long your hand is,
but just about a hand's length long.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also looks pretty healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be taking this branch off
of the cannabis plant, mostly because I
[SPEAKER_02]: really appreciate how long the stock is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be able to become submerged in the
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would try to find where the node is,
the part absolutely closest to the main
[SPEAKER_02]: stock and cut the branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far down and as close to the stock as
you can, right in the node if possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to make sure that you have clean
and sharp trimming pruning scissors to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since you really want the end to be a
perfect cut, you want it to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: absorb nutrients and not be all rugged.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wants to absorb.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a big CBG plant, as you can
see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've chosen to take this branch as a clone
due to its morphology.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to be doing pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't seem to have any nutrient
deficiencies or sicknesses, bugs that I
[SPEAKER_02]: could tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I'm going to do is take about
a hand's length of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's pretty subjective,
but find the node right where it would
[SPEAKER_02]: connect to the main stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right here we see two more branches
coming off.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right before they start growing is
where we want it to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where we want to take our snipping
from, right at the node.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you're ready, just take your
shears and cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you want to make sure you have
very sharp cutting shears so that once we
[SPEAKER_02]: actually put it in the cloner,
everything can penetrate into the bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: of the stock and it can begin growing in
the cloner.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've just taken the top of this branch
off so that we could clone it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And allow for these two branches to gain
more nutrients so that they can grow
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger and better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we could eventually take them as
clones, like we did this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we're going to do now.
So that's what we're going to do now.
