[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm gonna go over some of the
anatomical planes of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it won't take very long to go over,
but this is something you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: reviewing and be able to recognize each of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important, especially when we
get to dissections.
[SPEAKER_00]: See all these different planes here on
these different horses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, this looks like a bunch of
plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of these has a particular name,
and hopefully by the end of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be able to identify those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting first with just general
anatomical planes and just anatomical
[SPEAKER_00]: orientation, we have the dorsal side of
the horse, which is the back, the ventral,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is typically the stomach region,
distal, you see the hooves are distal,
[SPEAKER_00]: and proximal would be closer to the
midsection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cranial is towards the head, caudal is
towards the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So distal, we're saying something's
distal, it's further away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: midpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proximal would be closer to that
particular midpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit away, kind of
identifying and breaking something else
[SPEAKER_00]: apart here, we see our planes are coming
in now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our dorsal plane, our
transverse plane, still cranial is still
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the head, caudal still towards the
back, the dorsal side of the tail is the
[SPEAKER_00]: back side, the ventral is the underside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see our caudal towards the back,
cranial towards the head, all of this
[SPEAKER_00]: still holds true, despite where you may be
on the animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the neck region, the dorsal again is
the back, and ventral would be kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: underside region here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This light gray area here that looks like
it's kind of highlighting the whole thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's actually the sagittal plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the brain into the three
different planes, we have the frontal
[SPEAKER_00]: plane, which is represented by this plane
right here, this kind of plane right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sagittal plane, which is here,
dividing it right down the center,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then our transverse plane,
which is this kind of region right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how the brain might look.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of our sectional planes,
and you should be familiar with these,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just in the brain, but in any sort of
specimen in general, because they all hold
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, comparing it to a human might make
a little bit more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our transverse, it's basically the
body right in half, almost in this case
[SPEAKER_00]: here, but on this particular plane,
we'll be looking at dividing it crossways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have a coronal plane here,
which is that kind of more vertical,
[SPEAKER_00]: still the width of the body here,
and then the last one here in kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: purpley blue, would be the sagittal plane,
and that'd be kind of almost, in this
[SPEAKER_00]: case, right down the middle region here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting those just in three different ways
to look at it, our sagittal plane,
[SPEAKER_00]: our transverse plane, and our coronal
plane here, try to show in different
[SPEAKER_00]: colors, different areas to point to,
they all are basically representing and
[SPEAKER_00]: showing the same planes of the body,
but one might make a little bit more sense
[SPEAKER_00]: to you, one might be easier to understand,
so pick whichever one is most helpful to
[SPEAKER_00]: you, and try to learn that one,
and as a way to test yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you go back to the beginning slide,
the title slide here, hopefully you can
[SPEAKER_00]: identify what some of these planes are in
the body, and also regions of the model of
[SPEAKER_00]: course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
