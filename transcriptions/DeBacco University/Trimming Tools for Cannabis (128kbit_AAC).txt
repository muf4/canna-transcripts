[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
we're going to be looking at trimming tool
[SPEAKER_00]: options for cannabis, both on a manual
standpoint and also a mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint and some of the pros and cons
associated with each.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into trimming tools
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, trimming in general,
unlike many other plants, cannabis does
[SPEAKER_00]: require some method of kind of singling
out un-pollinated buds for the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process of removing the leaves near
the buds can require some detailed
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming if you're going for high quality
dry flower as your chosen end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there can be a lot of plant
volume to get through, so utilizing some
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanical method may be advised at least
to remove some of the bulk material,
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing for less plant material that
needs to be manually removed, which will
[SPEAKER_00]: improve your overall efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some will use a combination of manual
methods as well as mechanized methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some will choose to use one or the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using hand trimming methods,
your manual methods, the advantage of this
[SPEAKER_00]: is that it allows each bud to be handled
in a very unique way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's someone physically there going
through and taking out this leaf and not
[SPEAKER_00]: that leaf or removing that or trimming it
in this angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the great part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantages is with that option is
that it is very labor intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go through and be mindful and
take one section and not another section
[SPEAKER_00]: and be careful not to remove very vital
portions, remove those excess areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why some growers will go with a
kind of a machine trimming kind of option
[SPEAKER_00]: as we see here, a trommel version.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very efficient method, particularly
for high volume material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply feed in the system here and it goes
through and kind of manicured buds kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: come out the other end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is that this can damage
buds because it is a mechanical kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: tumbling process and there are other
methods, but regardless machines do have
[SPEAKER_00]: more of that physical contact with the
buds and could damage them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also may remove too much plant
material because they're not able to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and be very precise and unique
with each individual bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some growers are utilizing both
methods where they have a lot of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material to process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, they use a trommel or some
other form of mechanized system might be a
[SPEAKER_00]: good first step to initially trim the
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this will remove some of the
larger leaves, bulk material, which will
[SPEAKER_00]: then allow for the grower to spend time
doing the detailed work with each unique
[SPEAKER_00]: dry flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets the individual attention it
needs to look its best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is only possible kind of because
of the larger volumes to take off some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those plant materials so that the amount
of individual attention or the time that's
[SPEAKER_00]: spent with that individual attention is
definitely reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then starting with freshly harvest plant
material or dried plant material and
[SPEAKER_00]: starting basically to remove all of the
leaves and then go through and manicure
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes utilization of that mechanical
machine can be advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: To take out some of the grunt work and
then allow the kind of trimmer to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through to the detailed work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're producing the highest quality
end product possible.
