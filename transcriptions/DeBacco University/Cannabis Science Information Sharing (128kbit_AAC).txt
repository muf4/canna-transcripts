[SPEAKER_00]: On this Tobacco University video,
just going to go over cannabis information
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing in a very brief sense and hope
that you do share this channel with
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into cannabis science
information sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, realize that there are
limited published studies regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the advantage is it looks like
we're going to be on the increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is mainly been due to the
restriction of the ability for federal
[SPEAKER_00]: money to be used to spend on research due
to the classification of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many current studies being published with
more being released on a continual basis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will help improve the overall
education and information set going
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been said here that more cannabis
research will be done and published in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hope is that this rise in
information will give rise to more
[SPEAKER_00]: detailed information and allow to kind of
the exponential increase of the
[SPEAKER_00]: information to be spread and gained and
hopefully benefits to people all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're looking at doing your own
research and don't have an expensive lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: but want to see what other scientists are
doing, well, if you've got a computer and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching this, great research to
search for scientific based articles is
[SPEAKER_00]: Google Scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Google's great starting point,
but Google Scholar allows you to really
[SPEAKER_00]: research some of those scientific
articles, which can really make things
[SPEAKER_00]: really get into the details and where a
lot of the other information you read is
[SPEAKER_00]: really originated from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hope just in general, the hope is that
sharing quality information is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important and hopefully that will
continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This channel, Tobacco Universities,
main goal is to provide just that
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific based information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in return, hope is that you're able to
share this channel with others to help
[SPEAKER_00]: bridge the knowledge gap, to spread some
information, to put kind of in the
[SPEAKER_00]: comments, which you might want to see in
other videos, a new and interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: article you may have found and hope that
we can kind of build and continue building
[SPEAKER_00]: this community here to help education,
which will help everyone in the long run.
Thank you.
