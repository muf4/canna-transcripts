[SPEAKER_00]: So you may wonder, why is it important to
understand different types of tire wear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it can apply to your own tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go out and look at your own tires
to see how the pattern of wear might be
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring, an indication of something that
you may not have optimized with your
[SPEAKER_00]: tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you find a suspect's car and match
up the evidence at the crime scene with
[SPEAKER_00]: certain wear patterns of the tire and they
match up, it can help strengthen a case
[SPEAKER_00]: against someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we want to take care when
we're looking at tire alignment with a car
[SPEAKER_00]: and how that's going to impact the wear
patterns of the tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's something called camber,
toe, and caster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So camber is referring to the inward and
outward tilt of the tires as viewed from
[SPEAKER_00]: the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something called toe, and this is
from the side to side difference of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the front and the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it toe in or toe out?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something called caster,
which is the slope of the steering axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of like you think of a
caster, a nice shopping cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can notice that there's a negative
caster if it's a forward or a positive
[SPEAKER_00]: caster there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tire alignment can also play into the
wear as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking specifically about the camber,
this is the inward and outward tilt of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if viewed from the front, this is that
inward and outward tilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inward tilt is considered negative and
outward is considered positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look kind of at the car right here,
we can see it has negative camber and it
[SPEAKER_00]: has a lot of negative camber.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is used to distribute the load across
the entire tread, not so much in this
[SPEAKER_00]: case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Improper camber can make the tire wear on
one edge, as probably indicated here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and cause the vehicle to pull to the side
that has the most positive camber.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was something called toe,
and this is referring to toe in and toe
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the side to side difference in
distance between the front and rear of the
[SPEAKER_00]: front tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the distance is closer at the front,
it's called toe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see indicated here on this race car,
if you toe in and then the difference is
[SPEAKER_00]: closer, the rear, this would be called toe
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this can also impact the wear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last we have caster here as far as
orientation of the tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the caster is the fore or aft slope of
the steering axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's referring to whether it's a
negative caster or a positive caster.
[SPEAKER_00]: A neutral caster would be straight up and
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example here would be the shock
assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Positive caster is when the bottom of the
steering axis is in front of the tire's
[SPEAKER_00]: contact path and negative is of course the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So factory alignment specs, basically all
vehicles call for a certain degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: positive caster because this will help
ensure good stability and help maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: straight head direction with the promotion
of steering wheel self-centering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this helps that wheel kind of naturally
want to track in a straight line,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very helpful for handling
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at our tires and
we're trying to estimate the tread and
[SPEAKER_00]: where it may have worn or how much it is
worn, we can use a penny or a quarter
[SPEAKER_00]: using currency to estimate the tread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply using this penny and a quarter,
the depth of the tread can be closely
[SPEAKER_00]: examined and kind of looks at the
difference between when you put the penny
[SPEAKER_00]: down, how does it match up to the head of
the person printed on the currency there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, looking at the difference
between when pushing down to 30 seconds,
[SPEAKER_00]: tread is legally worn in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking here, it's just basically
touching the head of Abraham Lincoln.
[SPEAKER_00]: We flip that same penny around here and
look at six 30 seconds tread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's going to match pretty much
the base stairs there of the Lincoln
[SPEAKER_00]: monument.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proper tire inflation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at properly
inflated, we're going to have maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under inflated, only the edges are going
to be coming in contact and over inflated,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just going to have that middle
crease, that little kind of like that
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of balloon effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to refer to the vehicle's
owner's manual to make sure that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: the correct amount of tire inflation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's located on the door frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also be checked on a suspect's
car.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take the tire pressure and then
compare it to the door frame, you can have
[SPEAKER_00]: an indication of whether it was properly
overly or under inflated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old amount of cars prior to 2003 might be
inside the glove box, fuel filter flap,
[SPEAKER_00]: trunk lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different locations it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most are typically found on the door jam
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not use the pressure indicated or
molded into the tire sidewall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This indicates the pressure needed to meet
the tires fully rated load capacity,
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily specifically what was
matched for the vehicle itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under and over inflated, if you get
this little weird kind of symbol that
[SPEAKER_00]: shows up on the dashboard, that's an
indication of typically low tire
[SPEAKER_00]: inflation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under inflated tires have a higher rolling
resistance, which reduces fuel economy and
[SPEAKER_00]: they wear more rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that under inflated is going to have
this kind of wear pattern here,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's going to be a lot more wear on
the outside sidewalls than in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you over inflate a tire,
the opposite occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overinflation would have more wear in the
middle because you've kind of get that
[SPEAKER_00]: little balloon like effect there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why it's important to have
proper inflation because you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: have these uneven wear patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in a crime scene, they can help
you identify or match up a potential tire
[SPEAKER_00]: to a suspect's vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just, again, shows some more
comparisons of all the different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: under and inflation methods and
overinflation methods and different
[SPEAKER_00]: patchwares and cupwares.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you some kind of model
examples and comparisons because initially
[SPEAKER_00]: they may look very similar, but if you
look at them closely, you'll be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine the differences and hopefully
identify these individual and unique wear patterns.
