[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
we're going to look at two main cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: sorting categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here a much finer sort,
but why it's important to sort your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis buds shortly after harvest and
drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into sorting cannabis
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see a great kind of image of
that here, how we have some really fines
[SPEAKER_00]: to some more mid-sized to some larger ones
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this important?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to go through this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So upon harvest, we're looking at once the
buds are removed, the sorting process is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically larger buds yield the highest
dollar value and why those are typically
[SPEAKER_00]: separated out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smaller and less visually desirable buds
are typically destined for extraction or
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-rolls, because they're not going to
drive the high dollar value that a large
[SPEAKER_00]: single bud would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're sorting cannabis,
we have kind of our two main options.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can sort based on size and density.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages of doing that is allows you
to get top dollar for a high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also can be, maybe not always,
but it can be automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of see here with some varying
sizes, smaller buds will drop through the
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller areas, larger buds will work their
way further down and drop through a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how cannabis can be very
efficiently sorted in an automated sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also other sorting methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage though is that this can
be a time consuming process and can be
[SPEAKER_00]: subjective, particularly if you're doing
it manually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other growers will go through this size
and density sorting, and then they'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: another category where they basically are
sorting buds destined for extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages is this can provide a
consistent end product for what could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: variable starting product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantages is this can hide lower
quality flowers while still producing a
[SPEAKER_00]: quality end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So extraction, because you're not going to
be actually looking at the final flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: the final bud, is sometimes used for those
buds and flowers that aren't quite
[SPEAKER_00]: presentable, aren't quite the right
density, aren't quite kind of that visual
[SPEAKER_00]: impact to drive the top dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're destined for extraction where
the cannabinoids, terpenes will be removed
[SPEAKER_00]: and it will actually see the actual plant
product and they'll still get those
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts, which would be the same as if
they came from a visually appealing flower
[SPEAKER_00]: or visually unappealing flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the end, in the extract, it all comes
out the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
