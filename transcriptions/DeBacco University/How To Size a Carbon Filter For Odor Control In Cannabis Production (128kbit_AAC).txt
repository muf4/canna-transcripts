[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so you've selected a carbon filter
to reduce your odor in your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to buy a carbon filter and you realize
there's a lot of different sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well here at Tobacco University,
I'm going to go over how to size a carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: filter for odor control in cannabis
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's ensure that you buy the
right carbon filter the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go over some things you need to
take into consideration for sizing it
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the room measurements and
calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So calculate your room volume,
not just your growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to take into account the full
size of the room and not only where the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to simply be looking at
the, you know, length and width of the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to take into account the
height to get the full volume of the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an example, if you had a room that was
20 feet long, 10 foot wide, and then eight
[SPEAKER_00]: foot ceilings, you would have 1,600 cubic
feet of volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you want to take into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now CFM is cubic feet per minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times you'll see on filters,
they'll list things in cubic feet per
[SPEAKER_00]: minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the very least, you should exchange
your air about every three minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, typically you should aim for
really exchanging your air in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms volume at least once a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to continuing with this example
that we did in the previous slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had that 1,600 cubic foot room,
the minimum would be every three minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means you would need a filter that
would have a rating of at least 533.3 CFM.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you really want to be targeting
something at 1,600 CFM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, why don't, once you go larger?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, simply that does become more of an
expense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why people try to sometimes
reduce the size of the carbon filter,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this can restrict air flow and this
could cause other issues with ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, shooting for that, once every
minute to three minutes should be your
[SPEAKER_00]: target, favoring closer to that minute if
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And however, while we did those nice math
and it seemed nice and easy, and hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: you're continuing to watch this video,
there's other factors to take into
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as simple as doing a quick math
equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to take into consideration
your lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using high-intensity discharge
lighting, will require more ventilation
[SPEAKER_00]: and also provide a grow room cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the filter types, how restrictive is
the actual filter?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're using, you know, some of the more
expensive ones have that finer carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: particulate and they're going to flow a
little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what is the ambient temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Warmer temperatures will typically
increase the air flow required to aid in
[SPEAKER_00]: cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should be closer definitely to that
one exchange of the grow rooms volume per
[SPEAKER_00]: minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also need to consider the CFM
loss, meaning everything's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much CFM is lost through a 25 foot
section of ducting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Approximately 3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a straight hard cast to 7% if it's
flexible ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also 1 to 4% additional loss for every
90 degree bend.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why ideally if you had that
straight hard kind of casting,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is the most efficient way to move air
through a ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have this flexible ducting,
which makes it great for installation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you do lose about 1 to 4% and you want to
minimize, as we can see, not shown here,
[SPEAKER_00]: minimize the amount of 90 degree bends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have everything to be as
straight as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have as efficient movement of air
as possible to allow you to use,
[SPEAKER_00]: quote, the smallest filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can try to reduce the cost as much
as possible and also maximize the
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency of your ventilation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
