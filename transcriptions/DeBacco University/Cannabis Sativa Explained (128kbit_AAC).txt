[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another tobacco university
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be looking at some of
the details behind cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be explaining some of the
morphological characteristics where it
[SPEAKER_00]: might be used, some of its advantages,
as well as some of its disadvantages as a
[SPEAKER_00]: strain in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking first at the origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is an annual herbaceous
flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's indigenous to eastern Asia,
but is now very widespread throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably where it originated from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been cultivated throughout recorded
history, and it has a very diverse history
[SPEAKER_00]: of its use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been used for industrial fiber,
seed oil, food, recreation, religious and
[SPEAKER_00]: spiritual foods, and medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole bunch of different uses
that it's been used for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each part of the plant is harvested
differently depending on what the purpose
[SPEAKER_00]: of the use is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was first classified by Carl Linnaeus
in 1753.
[SPEAKER_00]: The word sativa means things that are
cultivated, so it applies to a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indicas and other flowering plants just in
general, but the sativa is thought to be
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the more original ones there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The morphology of these sativa strains are
typically very tall, growing 14 to 15 feet
[SPEAKER_00]: tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their internode spacing is about three to
six inches, and their leaves, if you took
[SPEAKER_00]: one off, would be very long and thin
compared to some of the other strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you have the height to grow in
the area if you are planning on growing a
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa strain of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, remember that they're also
photoperiod dependent, which can limit
[SPEAKER_00]: their height, so careful timing and
planting for outdoor locations or
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulation of photoperiod for an indoor
location can, to some degree, limit their
[SPEAKER_00]: overall height that they achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, popular cultivation locations for
sativas are outdoors because of the areas
[SPEAKER_00]: with long growing season because of the
height that they get.
[SPEAKER_00]: The season also prefer to get maximum
yield from this type of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others will time it to be later in the
season to limit the height due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: change in the natural photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing in a greenhouse,
or high tunnel, or something that has a
[SPEAKER_00]: ceiling limit, there's also the
possibility to be mindful for the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential limitations of how tall that
plant could get as it may outgrow your
[SPEAKER_00]: location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pruning is recommended to help increase
the plant efficiency and ultimately the
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're wondering what are some common
sativa cultivars, well, there are many.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an extensive list.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is high in THC, but sour diesel,
very common or famous on the East Coast of
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States, as well as many,
many others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just provided a quick list of three
there for some common sativa cultivars to
[SPEAKER_00]: help you understand ones that fall into
this classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching.
