[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this DeBacco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be looking at cannabis
seed selection options, comparing and
[SPEAKER_00]: giving some of the pros and cons to the
daisha seeds, your 50-50 male to female,
[SPEAKER_00]: or choosing feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one might be the best fit for your
operation?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll discuss here on this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, looking at our cannabis seed
selection options, as I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: daishas or feminized seed, which one would
you choose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, those daishas seeds
typically have a 50% male, 50% female
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio, at least theoretically.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing a small number,
you might not quite get to that exact
[SPEAKER_00]: 50-50 split.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you grow them on a large scale,
typically they'll fall right around those
[SPEAKER_00]: even split there, male to female,
where a feminized seed will produce
[SPEAKER_00]: generally a female plant at least over 95%
of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, what are the pros and cons to
these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, starting with daisha seeds,
what's the advantage of choosing those
[SPEAKER_00]: that will produce 50% male or female?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they have more genetic variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can be an advantage to some
people, especially if you're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they can produce pollen of a chosen
strain, which might be difficult to find
[SPEAKER_00]: or get, particularly those that are
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can offer more varieties to
select from because not all strains or
[SPEAKER_00]: types have been brought into the feminized
seed option there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to consider those as
advantages of using daisha seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are some disadvantages of
using daisha seeds in the sense that male
[SPEAKER_00]: plants will need to be removed if you're
not breeding, and that's going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: labor and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants will have to be cared for that may
not produce a valuable yield, say.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at those cannabinoid
contents from those female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll have to purchase more seeds
than you need because you have to expect
[SPEAKER_00]: this culling process to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some of the disadvantages to
choosing daisha seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at feminized seeds, what's the
advantage of a feminized seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, vastly reduce the time spent culling
out male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't necessarily completely
eliminate it, but vastly reduces it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's 95%, it means five out of every
100 will need to be culled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's 99%, that means one out of every
100 will have to be culled out,
[SPEAKER_00]: much more advantageous there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can purchase seed number can be more
close to match the total plant number.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at growing a hundred
plants, you don't have to purchase 200
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at producing maybe just over
that number there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes feminized seeds can be less
expensive in some cases, but that can
[SPEAKER_00]: depend on the strain, the variety,
or the availability of that seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then get into the disadvantages of using
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's limited strain selection
options, so that's going to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: types that you can potentially grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot use the seeds if you're a
breeder because you're only going to
[SPEAKER_00]: ideally get female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A potential negative impact on chemical
profile, at least that's thought of,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though that necessarily hasn't been
always proven out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, cost here is a potential
disadvantage in the sense that they could
[SPEAKER_00]: be more expensive in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as mentioned earlier, that could be
based on availability or particular strain
[SPEAKER_00]: or type that you're trying to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you're choosing the seeds,
keep in mind there are still some options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you choose the feminized seed route or
do you choose the daisha seed route?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
