[SPEAKER_00]: So on this DeBacco University video,
if you're looking at detecting whether or
[SPEAKER_00]: not you have hoplite and viroid,
I'm going to provide a brief overview
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing PCR to RT LAMP for RNA
detection, which one you might choose and
[SPEAKER_00]: why.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into a brief
comparison of PCR to RT LAMP when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at detecting hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we have to understand what
these actually refer to in means.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one we're going to look at is
PCR, which stands for Polymers Chain
[SPEAKER_00]: Reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has primers that are specific to a
nucleic acid region, and if present and
[SPEAKER_00]: positive binding occurs, it will be copied
multiple times, exponentially producing
[SPEAKER_00]: the original sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can not only determine if the
sequence is present or not, but with other
[SPEAKER_00]: detective instrumentation, the severity,
or how many particles were present at the
[SPEAKER_00]: start, can also be known.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can allow us to determine whether
there's a low or high viral, or in this
[SPEAKER_00]: case, viroid, load on that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of goes through and repeats,
repeats, repeats, and this can
[SPEAKER_00]: exponentially produce, and then how many
cycles, you can tell how many sequences we
[SPEAKER_00]: originally started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, PCR is also referred to as a
thermocycler because it takes one,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least theoretically one piece of DNA
or RNA, and makes many, many, many copies
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a thermocycler.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changes temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thermocycler is known to maximize
replication cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature is changed to allow the Taq
polymerase to effectively bind and
[SPEAKER_00]: replicate the strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by having different temperatures
cycling through, those are allowing for
[SPEAKER_00]: different rounds of this nucleic acid
replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it gets the term thermocycler.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting that kind of cycles,
goes through here, temperatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it repeats, and it repeats,
and it repeats, and repeats.
[SPEAKER_00]: PCR testing itself is a molecular testing
that has to be performed if detection of a
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid is the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also work for viruses as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're done in very, very small tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, you can do many, many tests
at one time going through that same
[SPEAKER_00]: thermocycler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, RTLAMP, a little different,
a little more longer name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stands for reverse transcription
loop-mediated isothermal amplification.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why RTLAMP is just so much easier
of a word to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, loop-mediated isothermal
amplification is DNA amplification method
[SPEAKER_00]: that allows for rapid and sensitive
detection of a specific gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: LAMP merged with reverse transcription,
that's how it gets the RT before it,
[SPEAKER_00]: has been successful for use for the
detection of several respiratory RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses, and now it's being also applied
to others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use a different enzyme in PCR that offers
the advantage of being effective at one
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and not the cycling of
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, PCR is also known as a
thermocycler.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's changing those temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can operate at a consistent
temperature, making it a little easier
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what this allows to be a little
easier for is actually field testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: RTLAMP is similar to PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: It uses a specialized enzyme to amplify
the viroid if it's present.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall is this enzyme is less
sensitive, and RTLAMP compared to the more
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though it's good at finding positive,
it's not really good at detecting true
[SPEAKER_00]: negatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might get some false positives
associated with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind also it is a field testing,
so sometimes it's a color change.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much did the color change?
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be some interpretation with that
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That needs to be taken into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, a lot of people ask, well,
why don't you just kind of use an antigen
[SPEAKER_00]: test?
[SPEAKER_00]: It got very popular with the SARS-CoV-2
virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This test for proteins, so this cannot be
used for viroids, unlike viruses,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they lack a coat protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viruses do have a coat protein,
viroids do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why this particular test cannot
be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're dependent on PCR or the RTLAMP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now of those, which one should you choose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, PCR is the standard for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's considered to be the most reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also provides very quick results.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not need a high number of virus
present in the original sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technically, it could work with just one
present, but it would still come back with
[SPEAKER_00]: a positive indication because it's the
amplification process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why this one typically is the
one that's recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though if you're looking quickly,
the RTLAMP might be a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous, kind of like in the field
testing, per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, if you want to get a true
positive or even a low level positive,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly if you're looking at veg
plants or early plants, PCR would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: one I would recommend.
Thank you.
