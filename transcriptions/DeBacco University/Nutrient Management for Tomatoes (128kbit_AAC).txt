[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at managing
nutrients for tomatoes and how to spot
[SPEAKER_00]: particular deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: What to look for a calcium deficiency,
a rot spot that starts at the blossom end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more common in longer tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply because the calcium has a longer to
travel, it typically runs out before it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets to the very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, soil testing to know if you're
naturally low in calcium and also make
[SPEAKER_00]: applications just before a fruit set of a
calcium product if there's known to be an
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a paste tomato shows this blossom end
rot that you're seeing here and here,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might be advantageous to start a
calcium regimen for your other varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's a longer tomatoes,
they typically will show it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a sign that your others may be
getting exposed to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So treat as soon as you see it starting to
develop to prevent it from getting on to
[SPEAKER_00]: the other crops there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to control?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, CalMag Plus from Botanicare or
BioMin calcium if you're under organic
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnesium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the lower leaves will start to
develop a mottled look to them and
[SPEAKER_00]: progress to brown lesions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of how they look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the brown lesions starting to
develop here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monitor plants and make applications if
problems are noticed before a fruit set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically the application would be adding
epsom salts, starting about a rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: about one tablespoon per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in part why CalMag is advised
because you get both calcium and
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not getting blossom end rot and
hopefully not getting too much of this
[SPEAKER_00]: lower leaf yellowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is browning of the leaf margins,
which is the edges of the leaves here.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other shoulders can be another
indication, but so can sun skulls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful on your sun skull areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to add a potassium product with
your irrigation water, especially if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have irrigated heavily during the plant
growth phase of development.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, you have pushed out or
flushed out some of that natural potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: that was in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfate or potassium applications are
recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: A kelp can also add potassium,
but it's often not in quantities needed,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially during a heavy fruit set of a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What to look for on our nitrogen
deficient, which is not always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe early in the season I'll be yelling
branches and typically the lower branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I feed nitrogen fertilizer,
especially early when the soil is on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cool side, it may not be greatly plant
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the nutrients in this is the easiest
one to fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of all the things to be low in,
choose to be low in nitrogen because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a quick and easy fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you apply nitrogen fertilizer to a
plant and it's low in nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: wait about three days or so if you water
it in immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it doesn't change in three to four
days, if not nitrogen, that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we talked about deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to talk about excessive nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overfeeding of one nutrient can block
other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is most common with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't benefit the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can cause a reduction in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates these very healthy,
put in quotes, looking plants that look
[SPEAKER_00]: just huge, but they don't really produce
much in the way of fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're shifting that plant to grow more
leaves than actually set fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also, when you over-fertilize,
potentially contaminate groundwater and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're also wasting time and money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apply fertilizers at recommended rates
and with a soil test to know if you should
[SPEAKER_00]: be adding that nutrient in the first
place.
