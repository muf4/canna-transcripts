[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tabaco University lecture
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm going to be going over genotype,
chemotype, and phenotype as it relates to
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeding of cannabis and to go over
these three main types and also provide
[SPEAKER_00]: you with some of their advantages and
disadvantages of utilizing each.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, breeding can be based on
three main categories here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenotype is basically how the plants
look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemotype is the chemical profiles that it
produces and genotype are the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, all of these are different
strategies for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we look at phenotype and
this is how the plant grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a result of how the genetics
interact with the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a plant has the genetics to grow 10
feet tall, but it's constantly under water
[SPEAKER_00]: or salt stress, the plant may only grow to
be three feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, the phenotype would be three
feet, even though the genetics are
[SPEAKER_00]: different in the sense that the genetics
could produce 10 feet tall plants because
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment, it may only reach three
feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the advantages to using
phenotype selection for, which is often
[SPEAKER_00]: used by growers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's often used because there's no
specialized equipment needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers can judge plants purely on the
performance for their given environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep the environment consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can allow different grow to grow
comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attentive growers can select one
individual out of many.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is another advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something is a genetic standout in its
look, then that could be, those genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: could be preserved and maybe cloned and
maybe carried out going further and bred
[SPEAKER_00]: in future lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are the disadvantages of using
phenotype selection is that resulting
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, even if it's a clone, may not be
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based only on the morphological
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also require an attentive grower,
typically growing many plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a grower is only growing a small number
of plants, that can be more difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: go through the process of phenotype
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then that brings us to chemotype,
which is referring to the chemicals
[SPEAKER_00]: produced by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have type one, which is a high THC
production plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have type two, which is a balanced
ratio of CBD to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then type three is a high CBD
production plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's others that go further and
look at type four being CBG dominant and
[SPEAKER_00]: type five being zero cannabinoids reduced
number there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the sense that those are looking more
at potentially producing terpenes and that
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the advantages to using this chemotype
breeding is that you can know the class
[SPEAKER_00]: specification of the cannabinoid
production in that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, it shows the plants not producing
the needed compounds to not be grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a way to select those and can
speed up the selection process or
[SPEAKER_00]: especially early on in a breeding program
as far as kind of eliminating those that
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be a waste of time for the
growers desired traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the disadvantages with using a
chemotype is that typically this requires
[SPEAKER_00]: specialized equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: High resolution mass spec is a kind of
high end piece of equipment that might as
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to really assess the chemical
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants may change classification based on
generations of the breeding process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a growers are selecting for one thing
or another, it's based on what the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: actually produces, which can be influenced
by many environmental factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just another downfall to consider
for using chemotype breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it leads us to genotype breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, traits such as photoperiod
dependence and cannabinoids produced can
[SPEAKER_00]: be strongly influenced by the genotype of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why using the genes can be a
very important and powerful tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages to using genotype breeding
is that it's very specific to the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic code.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows for quick and efficient
screening for targeted sequences and can
[SPEAKER_00]: be performed at any stage of the plant
growth cycle, meaning the genetics of that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant at the seedling stage as well at the
end ideally will be just about the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore, you're going to be able to
speed up the breeding process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of growing a plant all the way to
term, you could grow a bunch of seedlings,
[SPEAKER_00]: screen them for their genetics and then
select out those that don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: particular sequences deemed desirable by
the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are also some disadvantages
and the disadvantage of using a genotype
[SPEAKER_00]: for breeding is that it can require
specialized equipment, can also be
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some companies are offering genetic
testing for a fee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other companies are going through doing it
in-house with a lot of upfront cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will also with genotype breeding,
you need to know what you're specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may be able to find the whole
genetic sequence or find certain targeted
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences, but you may need a way of
detecting or knowing what particular
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences you're actually looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, this is just a comparison
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How will you base your breeding strategy
on phenotype, chemotype or genotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: Each had its own pros and cons and you can
find videos on this channel about each of
[SPEAKER_00]: these in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to explore any of them
further, continue to search on this
[SPEAKER_00]: channel and I'm sure you will find some
more information to allow you to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: best breeding strategy going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
