[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the title, it should come as no
surprise that this is going to pertain to
[SPEAKER_00]: skeletal muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting into a little bit more detail of
the skeletal muscle and exactly what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to recognize the microscopic
view here, and keep in mind this is
[SPEAKER_00]: voluntary controlled, so we do have
control over where it goes and what we do
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So skeletal muscle overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each muscle has a discrete organ composed
of muscle tissue, blood vessels,
[SPEAKER_00]: nerve fibers, and connective tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, here's a little bit bigger image of
the microscopic look.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have neurons connecting it because
we need a way for our brain to tell that
[SPEAKER_00]: muscle to contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it is voluntary controlled,
that is why we have the motor neuron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the three connective tissue sheaths are
the endo-mesium, the para-mesium,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the epi-mesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these connective sheaths, just like
our knife here, the sharp blade of the
[SPEAKER_00]: knife is stored in the sheath.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a protective outer layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That same concept applies here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our mesiums are skeletal muscle fibers,
the black circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endo-mesium is the red circle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Para-mesium is the green, and the outer
thick area here is called the epi-mesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that endo-mesium, you can see that
pictured here in this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Para-mesium is the area, this sheath
protective layer here, and the epi-mesium
[SPEAKER_00]: located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at these in a little bit more
detail, that endo-mesium is the fine
[SPEAKER_00]: sheath of connective tissue composed of
particular fibers surrounding each muscle
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, endo means in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the innermost portion here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Para-mesium are fibrous connective tissues
that surround groups of muscle fibers
[SPEAKER_00]: called the fascicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's our para-mesium, where this is one
zoomed in area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the fascicle located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the overcoat here, the dense
regular connective tissue that surrounds
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire muscle is the epi-mesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of that as like epidermis is the
outer most covering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a little bit more detail, epi-mesium
allows the muscle to contract and move
[SPEAKER_00]: powerfully while maintaining its
structural integrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the epi-mesium here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This epi-mesium also separates muscle
fiber from other tissues, allowing the
[SPEAKER_00]: muscle to move independently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, these muscles need to
move and contract, need to be separate
[SPEAKER_00]: from what's surrounding them within the
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that epi-mesium helps provide that
barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going a little deeper here, a para-mesium
allows the nervous system to trigger a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific movement of a muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's allowing that connection of that
neuron to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the innermost, the endo-mesium here
contains the extracellular fluid and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients to support the muscle fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we'll learn that for these muscles to
contract, a lot needs to go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this endo-mesium is providing that
fluid and nutrients to help allow our
[SPEAKER_00]: muscle fibers to contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: These nutrients are supplied ultimately
from the blood to the muscle tissue,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's where nutrients are brought in
and waste are brought out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly here, our muscle fiber,
produced by the fusion of several cells at
[SPEAKER_00]: their ends, this creates very long muscle
fiber that contains all the original
[SPEAKER_00]: nuclei.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that we're having this
linking of a bunch of these cells
[SPEAKER_00]: together, this multi-nucleated fiber
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: These microfilaments are bunched together
to create myofilaments, and that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're noticing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skill to muscle, as a reminder,
found in voluntary muscles, and they
[SPEAKER_00]: produce powerful voluntary contractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be something that we're having
control over and moving and able to have
[SPEAKER_00]: control over, which we'll notice will be
different compared to the other two
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of muscles.
Thanks for watching.
