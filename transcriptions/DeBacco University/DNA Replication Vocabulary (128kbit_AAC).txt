[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm gonna cover some necessary
DNA replication vocabulary, need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to understand because these terms
will be used as quote, common knowledge in
[SPEAKER_00]: the process of DNA replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a couple of them labeled here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this initially doesn't make a lot of
sense, hopefully after you watch the
[SPEAKER_00]: video, you come back to this, you'll be
able to understand it more fully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the basics of words,
we have something called a helicase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an enzyme that binds to nucleic acids
and it separates or unwinds DNA into
[SPEAKER_00]: single strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gonna allow each strand to be
copied.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the helicase here represented by this
triangle and that's taking this
[SPEAKER_00]: double-stranded helix and separating out
into single strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're looking at the process of
replication, we know it occurs in a
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-conservative way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to isolate each of those
individual parental strands into single
[SPEAKER_00]: strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we're rejoining our DNA into
single strands, making it double-stranded
[SPEAKER_00]: again, looking back in this region,
of the top lagging strand and here down
[SPEAKER_00]: here, the leading strand, we have a
process called annealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when DNA is rejoined.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna happen when DNA is cooled as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The annealing is just think of it's like
that sticking those back together,
[SPEAKER_00]: those hydrogen bonds are reforming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Important vocabulary words, and these
aren't necessarily words, these are
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers, but really important to
understand the orientation of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a five prime, that's what the
little indication here is, five prime
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon has a phosphate group attached to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three prime carbon has a hydroxyl or
OH group attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these, you'll see these little
fives and these little threes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is referring to the number five
carbon and number three carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important for orientation
because there is a quote right and a wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: way that bases can be added.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking those terms, those five prime and
three prime terms and relating them to DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: polymerase, which is an enzyme that
creates DNA molecules by assembling the
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleotides.
[SPEAKER_00]: This polymerase, it's an enzyme,
ACE, it's an enzyme that's putting things
[SPEAKER_00]: together, attaching nucleotides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always synthesizes in the five to three
prime direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see it looking here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the five to three prime direction
as the only way that this enzyme can
[SPEAKER_00]: operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enzymes' shapes are very important and
these molecules we saw on the previous
[SPEAKER_00]: slide can only bind in the five to three
prime direction because it can only bind
[SPEAKER_00]: to and add nucleotides to that three prime
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we're separating out our DNA,
we'll notice that it is kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: inverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's going one way, one's going the other
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we have this synthesizing in the
five to three prime direction,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's our leading strand, the easiest to
understand because that's going through
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's going in the five to three prime
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to say initially,
well, what about this three prime here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because it has to be anti-parallel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see a three prime here, there's
going to be a five prime here and five to
[SPEAKER_00]: three prime is perfectly, well,
how DNA primates can go right along and we
[SPEAKER_00]: see no breaks in that sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this other strand here, we have a five
prime, so we need a three prime here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cannot work in this same direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to kind of work backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call this the lagging strand because
it's going to work here and get to the end
[SPEAKER_00]: and have to deattach and kind of come back
over and bind here and work again.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's these little kind of sections,
these little fragments.
[SPEAKER_00]: These fragments are called Okazaki
fragments and they're short DNA segments
[SPEAKER_00]: that form on the lagging strand during the
replication process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply because that polymerase has to work
in the five to three prime direction,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can see here, helicase hasn't opened up
the DNA molecule fully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's working from here to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to deattach and reattach here and
come back this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, the leading strand, it can just keep
working right along because that three
[SPEAKER_00]: prime end is exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And polymerase only works in the five to
three prime direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have RNA primers, which are very
short strands of RNA that act as the
[SPEAKER_00]: starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of like the little flags that
say DNA polymerases start here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have DNA ligase, which is an enzyme
that facilitates in the joining of these
[SPEAKER_00]: strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ligase, think of it as it links things
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's linking those bonds together and
forming something very stable,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we want for our DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully now, if we look at our
beginning image here, this makes a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand leading and lagging strands
and good vocab terms to review.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we get into the replication process.
