[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this tobacco university video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go over proper cannabis
seedling care.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're fortunate enough to get a small
seedling, I want to help you understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what environmental conditions you'd have
set up to increase the best odds of
[SPEAKER_00]: success of your seedling continuing to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the video here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, at emergence,
remember emergence is where that seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: is just going to start to emerge,
whatever substrate media you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as the seed emerges, it's
important to ensure proper care to allow
[SPEAKER_00]: for continued plant development.
[SPEAKER_00]: At no point do you want to stunt that
plant and very early on can have very
[SPEAKER_00]: detrimental effects going for the long
term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same basic conditions of germination
processes can be initially maintained,
[SPEAKER_00]: but changes should be made gradually to
ensure strong and quality seedlings
[SPEAKER_00]: produced as those plants start to age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what temperature do you want to keep
those seedlings at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, keeping plants slightly cooler than
during the germination process is
[SPEAKER_00]: typically advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you mean by slightly cooler?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're typically looking at that 68 to 77
degrees Fahrenheit or 20 to 25 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, as is typically the case during the
dark or lights off period, the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: can be decreased to around 65 degrees
Fahrenheit or 18 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having this temperature drop can help
reduce internode spacing or stretching and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the plant stocky and not leggy,
weak and thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a cool off during the nighttime or
lights off period can be advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't always have to keep them at a
really high temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the relative humidity that you want
to be having your plants under,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically as the plants grows,
the humidity levels will be decreased over
[SPEAKER_00]: time, eventually reaching that target of
that 60, 65% relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This reduces the water stress on the plant
and allows time for the root system to
[SPEAKER_00]: become more robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to help you in the long
run produce a healthy, stocky seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the very tip of fan leaves,
if that's burning, then it's likely
[SPEAKER_00]: because of lack of humidity or temperature
or light stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be an indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're starting to see at the very end
of your fan leaves a little burning there,
[SPEAKER_00]: that could be an indication that there's
either too low humidity, temperature is
[SPEAKER_00]: too high, or there's too intense light on
your little seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: When speaking specifically about light,
the intensity of light should be increased
[SPEAKER_00]: as the seedling develops to match the
levels it will be exposed to in the main
[SPEAKER_00]: growing environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your seedlings might be going
outdoors, and if they're going outdoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: then light exposure should be increased to
natural sunlight levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shade netting is commonly used of
different percentages to ease the
[SPEAKER_00]: transition of the seedlings to the
intensity of natural light levels that
[SPEAKER_00]: they will be exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you're growing indoors,
the light exposure should be increased to
[SPEAKER_00]: the chosen PAR level for the veg rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're working those plants, hardening
them off so you don't get any light burn
[SPEAKER_00]: in the later stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be done typically by dimming the
lights, if that's an option with the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights you're using, or by adjusting
decreases in the distance between the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights and the plants to alter the
intensity that those plants will be
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to, again, over time to help ease
that transition process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now proper watering techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you've got your little seedlings,
a fine nozzle should be used and kept
[SPEAKER_00]: inverted to allow for natural rain,
fall-like impact on the seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're using a very fine nozzle,
you can point in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part there is to reduce the impact
of that water on those seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always want to keep your nozzle moving
to ensure seedlings get exposure and the
[SPEAKER_00]: tray can hold some water reserves to avoid
seedling desiccation or drying out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's hard to kind of explain this,
so here I'm going to transition to a
[SPEAKER_00]: video.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to show you the proper watering
technique for newly emerged cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings and hope you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so here we're seeing a bunch of
cannabis seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you look closely at the trays,
the center of each tray you'll see an
[SPEAKER_00]: oasis cube missing, and that's done on
purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so the person doing the irrigating
can keep an idea of just how much water is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually saturating or in that tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also notice the technique here where
the spray is being kept very close to the
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings and moving around, making sure
to get the corners as well as the center
[SPEAKER_00]: portions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it's the corners that dry out
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the edge effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be mindful of avoiding that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see our way working right through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's a pretty fine nozzle there and
just working way back and forth,
[SPEAKER_00]: back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also see in the background how many
seedlings this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be a way to ensure they all get
the proper amount of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
