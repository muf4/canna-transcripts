[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at soil testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides analysis of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you do is you take a
representative sample from a field,
[SPEAKER_00]: you send it to a lab, and they work on
extracting certain nutrients from the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, and they report back to you on a
sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can email it, they can mail it to you,
and it's a great way for you to find out
[SPEAKER_00]: information about what's going on in your
field that it's kind of hard to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely observe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can save you a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often I get asked the question,
is it worth $20?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is it worth the cost?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's $20 just on average.
[SPEAKER_00]: The information you can't see,
and in my opinion, it's one of the best
[SPEAKER_00]: $20 you can spend on a field.
[SPEAKER_00]: The benefits are great and the costs are
low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I highly recommend soil
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're looking at an area for pH,
you may not have to go through and do the
[SPEAKER_00]: complete soil analysis, but sometimes I'll
even test a field multiple times during
[SPEAKER_00]: the year, typically in the spring and also
again in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many sample locations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can't take too many different
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: In various fields, there might be a good
field, a bad field, an average field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ideally want to sample these
separately, at least for the initial test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, the example is we have a wooded
area, a vegetable garden, a low-lying
[SPEAKER_00]: area, some green grass, but you want to
sample an area that's fairly consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see in this low-lying area,
there's some yellow spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, those sample locations are outside
of those yellow spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would test those separately just to get
an idea what would be going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a pH issue, it could be
something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vegetable garden is sampled separately
than the wooded area, than the green
[SPEAKER_00]: grass, as many different locations at
least to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you determine, oh,
these two are very similar, these two are
[SPEAKER_00]: the same, in the future, you could reduce
your number of samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But initially, just try to get an idea as
many different areas as you think
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your goal is to get a representative
sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is your population.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want your sample to be within that
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the soil lab is only as good as the
sample that you use sent them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So proper sampling technique is your
responsibility, and take time with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different ways they can still
get you accurate results, so not just one
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use a spade shovel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a soil auger or a soil tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really matter, as long as
you're consistent and able to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: sample within your population.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, this would be your field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how to sample?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, proper sampling technique and
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really all that complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to take a random, I always say,
six to nine samples per area that's about
[SPEAKER_00]: six to nine inches deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty easy to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six to nine samples, six to nine inches
deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is you don't want to go much
deeper or much shallower than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where your roots are going to be
exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tools of the trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Official stainless steel probe you can
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used those in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make it really easy if you're doing a
lot of samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly walking in large corn fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I use, sometimes, an inch and a half
PVC pipe and a sledgehammer and a pail and
[SPEAKER_00]: a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take the PVC pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it straight, ideally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your sledgehammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the plastic bag in the pail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pound the PVC pipe into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knock out the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take another walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pound it in the ground again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're six to nine inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it back in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that bag out when I'm done with that
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Label the tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take another bag out of my pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it back in the pail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go through and do it for another field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes it pretty quick and easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't have to be all that
complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like inch and a half because the soil
comes out of this pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go much smaller, especially if it
rained recently or it's a wetter soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might get really jammed in there pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inch and a half I can wrap it a couple
times with a sledgehammer and usually it
[SPEAKER_00]: falls right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where to test?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: More cost does not necessarily mean better
tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Universities provide great quality
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tested at multiple labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all give pretty consistent
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know certain people that spend a lot
more than I do on soil tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've looked at their results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they give you some more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some more ratios and a little bit
different information as far as details
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But pretty much I just want to see the
numbers of results that we can work on
[SPEAKER_00]: balancing the soil from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you're spending more in
this case does not always mean it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: better test.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do the results tell you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember it's not the total nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a big misconception.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an estimation of the plant available
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil test results provide the extractable
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't care how much potassium is in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know how much is available to
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what soil tests try to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why if you send two samples from
the same field to the same lab to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: test them to see and they come back with
different numbers and you think that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're giving you wrong results,
well they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a certain amount of variability
that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they'll be very close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they won't be the exact same number.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting an estimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to knock off these
nutrients from the soil and determine
[SPEAKER_00]: what's available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a soil test for plants doesn't
matter how much you have in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants another portion of that nutrient
that's extractable and ideally available
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of our last majority you see here of
the potassium and phosphorus is bound up
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil not available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not what the soil tests measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're measuring extractable nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it so difficult to test?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do some labs not test for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do some labs used to test for it and
don't anymore?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well to get an accurate result you need to
do nitrate test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen is in constant flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's constantly changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind the lab will test and
generate an accurate result for the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if this doesn't represent your field,
it's not valuable or worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have the estimation of the
nitrogen that's in your field and the June
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate test is the best way to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taken in June.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to sample down 12 inches a little
deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to put it in a plastic bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to put it in a paper bag so it
breathes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get it to the lab as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically people will sample and drive it
directly to the lab to get the most
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate results that represent their
field conditions as possible.
Thank you.
