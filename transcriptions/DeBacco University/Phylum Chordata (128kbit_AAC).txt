[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to take a brief overview
of the animal phylum cordata.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the title slide image here,
we see the glass catfish, which is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the few cordates with a visible backbone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, they're improving on the
skeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: They exhibit a truly internal endoskeleton
with muscles attached to an internal rod
[SPEAKER_00]: called the notochord.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that evidence here in the cartoon
image in this red line here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The innovation opened the door for large
body sizes not possible of early animal
[SPEAKER_00]: forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: How it looks kind of in real life here,
we see a great image here where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the 40 notochord cells are
highlighted in red here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is immunofluorescence,
so that's why they're glowing red in this
[SPEAKER_00]: image.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read about it here, but that's
just showing you that line is indicating
[SPEAKER_00]: where the notochord is located in this
particular individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I said a large increase in size,
and based on if you watch the videos in
[SPEAKER_00]: the correct order, you can see all of
these animals are much larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have internal skeletons either
made of bone or cartilage, and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: what the muscles are working against.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most endoskeletons are made of bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a couple here, for example,
the shark, where we have more of that
[SPEAKER_00]: cartilage intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of these contain that internal
skeleton made of bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's approximately 56,000 species
of cordates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all share these four principal
features at least some point in their
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not at all stages, but at some point
they'll have all of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: The presence of a notochord, a nerve cord,
pharyngenal pouches, and a post-anal tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of provides a little bit of a
detailed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has an individual here living in an
aqueous environment, looking at a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more detail in this case, but this gives
you an appreciation for the complexity of
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide here, I'm going to give you
just kind of that brief overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the four main common features.
[SPEAKER_00]: That notochord, that nerve cord,
pharyngenal slits, and a post-anal tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, they may not all exist at
the same time, but in order to fit into
[SPEAKER_00]: this phylum, they have to exist at some
point in the animal's life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, proving on the skeleton, well,
not all cordates are actually vertebrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are actually two examples of ones
that aren't vertebrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tunicates here, kind of a unique look to
them, and lancelet here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two examples of cordates that
aren't vertebrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: With speaking of vertebrates, vertebrate
cordates have two important aspects,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is a great image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vertebrates have a backbone that replaces
the role of the notochord.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vertebrates also have a distinctive,
well-defined head region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is two distinguishing factors for
vertebrates that fit under the animal
[SPEAKER_00]: phylum cordates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
