[SPEAKER_00]: If you've looked at different storage
options for cannabis buds, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term storage and considered vacuum
sealing, this DeBacco University video is
[SPEAKER_00]: for you because we're going to cover
vacuum sealing for storing cannabis buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the image shows here, let's get into
vacuum sealing for storing cannabis buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, this is a good long-term
storage option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six plus months is what we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking when we talk long-term
storage times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even a year later, with this method,
there can be no noticeable reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: potency, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put all that work into growing a
quality product, drying it, curing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to make sure you have a nice,
good long-term storage option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So vacuum sealers are also very cost
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another advantage is that the
actual equipment needed is not all that
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive and can be used in both large as
well as small scale environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also applies to more than just cannabis
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used for other food items as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they're so common, which is a
great option to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you do want to avoid the vacuum
sealing bags themselves for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: because as we can see in both of these
image, while it does seal the buds very
[SPEAKER_00]: well, the environment created by the bags
and jars is essentially the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be physical damage if you use
the bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's crushing the structure of
those buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this will not impact the chemical
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use vacuum sealing jars for cannabis is
advised to preserve the contents as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as the physical structure of those
contents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I'm talking about on
jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use either true vacuum sealing
jars or sealable jars that then you put
[SPEAKER_00]: into a bag and seal it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers prefer the bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're less expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They store easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have a chosen jar, but it may not
seal quite perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vacuum sealing it will be a great option
because the physical structure will be
[SPEAKER_00]: preserved because the buds are protected
in the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this may also increase the total
storage area that's required.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind that now
probably can't stack these jars as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: you could have when they're just their
jars themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small containers are great to ensure only
small portions are being exposed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: air and degradation, which will help
ensure most of the harvest will be kept in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ideal environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to vacuum seal large giant
containers because once you break that
[SPEAKER_00]: seal and open it up, you'll be exposing
more buds to the outside environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the jars small, kind of what you'll
use in a short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a great way to ensure that the
overall total harvest is preserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mason jars, jars in general, great option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw in a vacuum seal bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you know it is definitely
isolated from the outdoor environment to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep your buds for a very long term,
which is the goal here to preserve that
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest so you can enjoy it well after the
initial point of plant takedown.
