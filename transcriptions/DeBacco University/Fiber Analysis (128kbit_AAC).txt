[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to another video here on
Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to be looking at fiber
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we see in the rope picture here,
there's a large piece of fiber,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's also some smaller fibers in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to look how you would
analyze those and how would we look at
[SPEAKER_00]: those in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, when we're looking at
fibers, there's two main categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's natural fibers, which are made
from animal or plant based fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might be familiar with like
cotton, silk and wool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the cotton plant located right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have synthetic fibers,
which are man-made or artificial,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're produced entirely from
chemicals, typically in extrusion process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examples of these are polyester,
rayon, or acrylic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polyester is the single most used textile
overtaking cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've actually started using more
synthetic fibers than natural fibers now.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at fibers, we want to
be taking into consideration the
[SPEAKER_00]: coloration of those fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example of kind of viewing
them on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're also under a microscope,
and this is an acetate fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that kind of blue color.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it didn't have any dye in it,
it'd kind of be like a gray kind of color
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the dye wasn't present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this definitely shows that with a light
microscope, you can also determine
[SPEAKER_00]: individual fiber color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into fiber diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at these, particularly
the diameter of the fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like a circle, the diameter is kind
of through the center and from one end to
[SPEAKER_00]: the other, it's a straight line that
passes through the center and ends at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end points of that circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So same as diameter in a math class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since hair can be variable because it only
provide a general range, keep in mind as a
[SPEAKER_00]: person ages, their hair typically becomes
thicker and stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thicker hair is found closer to
the root section of the hair and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like thins out or almost tapers as it gets
to the end within some degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the diameter of human hair is
typically a range of about 17 to 181
[SPEAKER_00]: millionths of a meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or typically we start looking at microns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's an average hair here of 70
microns in diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we have a fabric pill,
which is the pilling is a term used for
[SPEAKER_00]: loose strands or balls of fiber that form
on a piece of fabric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, if you have older fabric,
you kind of get this pilling that
[SPEAKER_00]: develops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pills form due to rubbing and abrasion
during normal wear and use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can indicate if you find a piece
of fabric that does have a lot of this
[SPEAKER_00]: pilling, indication that it might be worn
or has a lot of abrasion over a period of time.
