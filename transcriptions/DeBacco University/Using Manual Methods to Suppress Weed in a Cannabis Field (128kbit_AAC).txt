[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this Tobacco University video,
we're going to be looking at manual
[SPEAKER_00]: weeding methods to suppress weeds in a
cannabis field.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something probably all done at one
time or another, but we're going to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at using manual methods to suppress weeds
in a cannabis field here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, manual weeding, this can be
the most effective weeding method to be
[SPEAKER_00]: very precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it does require the most time and
also the most labor, which can make it
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibitive in certain systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, increasing the effectiveness of
manual weeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers should have a regular schedule
when it comes to manual weeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the weed pressure,
the frequency will be determined based on
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going more than seven days though between
weeding events is not advised,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially early in the season when high
soil moisture and low plant densities may
[SPEAKER_00]: make weeds more aggressive to get
established and to propagate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm going to watch the weather when
we're looking at manual weeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: because often rainstorms will delay when
weeding can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when in doubt, weed before a potential
storm, even if it's before your planned
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because soil being very heavy,
very, very wet, and waterlogged can make
[SPEAKER_00]: it a challenge to go through and weed,
and it's also going to encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially more weeds to germinate and
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's the ideal time of day to weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, while any time you can do it really
is best, the ideal time is actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning just after sunup.
[SPEAKER_00]: This way, any weeds removed will have
roots exposed to the hot portion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day, and this will increase the odds of
desiccation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weeding at sunset, the weeds may be able
to re-root overnight, reducing your time
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be because if you're just kind of
leaving some weeds in the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: not removing them offsite in a separate
pail or a container, if you're just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of going through the loophole,
it can be one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be effective, but you want to do
that typically more in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not advised that you actually till
your soil, and this is not an advised
[SPEAKER_00]: method, because growers will often run a
tiller to bury the weeds, or that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: they think.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what growers may not realize is
that they are actually bringing up or
[SPEAKER_00]: tilling up new weed seeds and really not
fixing the problem, just encouraging a
[SPEAKER_00]: repeatingness of that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you simply go through and cut the
weeds, this is called creating a sterile
[SPEAKER_00]: seed bed, and you're moving the weeds that
germinate and slowly killing all the
[SPEAKER_00]: available weed seeds to reduce the
pressure, at least ideally, as the season
[SPEAKER_00]: progresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, looking at this sterilized seed bed,
I have a separate video on this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're welcome to search the channel
for that topic, so you can learn a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more about how that may fit your
particular growing system.
