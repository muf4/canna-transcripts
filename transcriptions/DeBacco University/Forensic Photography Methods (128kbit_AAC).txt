[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so here I'm going to go over forensic
photography methods and things you might
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be considering and this is some
things that make it advantageous if you
[SPEAKER_00]: get a camera that allows you to adjust
some features because it can really allow
[SPEAKER_00]: you to maximize the shot considering you
can't move the object or change a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things by adjusting the camera you can
capture the information of the image that
[SPEAKER_00]: you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting first, general methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at all photographs must contain
three elements, the subject, scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a reference object.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have a prime example of the
footprint here with a nice scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like a subject, kind of a
reference object.
[SPEAKER_00]: I included a website here at the bottom
that at the time of videotaping this video
[SPEAKER_00]: here so it's active and it allows you to
print out something just like this to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow you to include this in any images
that you may take or want to practice
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way to kind of have color
correction, have size, have scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: have contrast, really allows a set
distance so really allows you to add a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of these elements to the photographs that
you take.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what should our crime scene photographs
should contain what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well as you can kind of see in the images
here they should always be in focus so in
[SPEAKER_00]: the case it's kind of easy when they're in
a controlled environment but we don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to move them so we need to make sure that
they are in focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also need to be kind of the main
object within the photograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again this depends what photographs we're
taking that's particularly talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: the object.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contain a scale or ruler so as we can see
in these images while they all listed as
[SPEAKER_00]: 45 they all contain that nice scale
allowing us to know the exact size of that
[SPEAKER_00]: object and also it number tags it which is
great for organization purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That scale or ruler having a little right
angle here also helps be a fair and
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate representation of what is seen so
while we have that as our main object
[SPEAKER_00]: what's around it or where it may occur be
or be placed or be left also important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any change in color may misidentify an
object or investigators and possible
[SPEAKER_00]: jurors so this is why we want to have our
photographs be as accurate to true life as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which one of these is the best
representation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a couple options here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have photograph 1 and photograph 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now photograph 2 is the correct
representation so a lot of people look at
[SPEAKER_00]: photograph 1 and say that's a little bit
brighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well you're losing some of the detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photograph 1 is too much light means that
the photographer failed to catch the
[SPEAKER_00]: proper light to describe the object.
[SPEAKER_00]: By adjusting the flash the photographer
should adjust camera flash to capture the
[SPEAKER_00]: object in the detail as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one we want this level of detail and
scale is if I took this out here and just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of took a picture of the turtle you
would know if that's an adult large turtle
[SPEAKER_00]: or small turtle by putting some hands
showing how small it is that gives us that
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective or that correct
representation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be mindful here's two objects the exact
same but that slight difference of cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: down the light really takes into account a
lot more of the detail now.
[SPEAKER_00]: When taking the photographs now with the
digital aid we are taking a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: photographs which is great but we also
need to keep a photograph log.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be done as you're taking the
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Responding officer must also maintain this
log of any photographic evidence that is
[SPEAKER_00]: taken should contain the date the time of
the photograph the subject matter and any
[SPEAKER_00]: additional notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be done in order and also who
took those pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very important there's two people taking
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: These logs must be maintained within a
case file or incident report as they are
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the examination record and
discoverable material at trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important as much as people don't
like to do this to be updating this log as
[SPEAKER_00]: you're taking the pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you may still want to cross
something go to a different direction you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be making sure that you're kind of
always making that subject in those
[SPEAKER_00]: comments as you're taking the pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's three components of
photography there's ISO shutter speed and
[SPEAKER_00]: aperture and this is kind of a great way
of kind of creating a quick little
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aperture a small aperture will get a
further depth of field larger aperture
[SPEAKER_00]: tends to focus more closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shutter speed the faster the shutter speed
you can stop a moving object the slower
[SPEAKER_00]: the shutter speed will blur an object if
it is moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically on crime scenes the objects
aren't moving all that fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: ISO low sensitivity and high sensitivity
can get a little bit more greening
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially depending on other factors
that we may be using with our cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ISO just to start here International
Organization for Standardization relates
[SPEAKER_00]: the camera sensitivity to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the days of film there was they
were still different ISOs but this creates
[SPEAKER_00]: a great contrast here photograph one
photograph two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shutter speed is the same focus is the
same but the ISO is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's ISO of 100 you can barely make that
object out here's 1600 it's very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: In dark environments the ISO makes light
sensor of the camera more sensitive so
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing the ISO will allow this in a
dark environment to show quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: ISO has a high possibility to make camera
noise which is kind of blurriness which
[SPEAKER_00]: can cause that visual distortion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much dependence on ISO can distort the
image so knowing your camera knowing how
[SPEAKER_00]: to adjust certain things is great if
you're left with only adjusting ISO go as
[SPEAKER_00]: least as possible so you don't get noise
and distortion for your images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shutter speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shutter speed is the length of time when
the film or the digital sensor inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: camera is exposed to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a slow shutter speed to
get that kind of smoothing of the water
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of cascade effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our two images shot with different
shutter speeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: One 25th of the second one 400th.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two photographs taken are the same
situation except the shutter speed is
[SPEAKER_00]: changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The slow shutter speed makes image more
clear and bright because the low shutter
[SPEAKER_00]: speed takes in more light than the higher
shutter speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: However high shutter speed is often
necessary for moving objects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case we see kind of can make
out one fingerprint sort of kind of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we can make out that one for sure but
also several others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the ruler is much clearer visible
here allowing us to get a better idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: the size of that object.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example of adjusting shutter
speed and how they can vastly impact the
[SPEAKER_00]: image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aperture or focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aperture means the extent with the
sharpness of an image is shown with the
[SPEAKER_00]: lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we can see a line of candles one two
three four all pretty well in focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here the first one's a little blurry the
second one looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third one's a little blurry and the fourth
one definitely is blurry and definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So photograph one all of these are very
clearly visible with a high aperture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photograph two the image shows an object
with the right focus but the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: objects are all blurred because of low
aperture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be important if this is the one
you're looking at focusing on for some
[SPEAKER_00]: reason but this tells a little bit better
story of where these objects are and what
[SPEAKER_00]: is also located behind them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to keep aperture and
focus in mind which might be limited based
[SPEAKER_00]: on the light and other factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly the flash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at flash of the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a white balance of the photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flashing it's set to mimic daylight to
ensure proper color balance of the subject
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be mindful though of reflections
particularly of glass objects or shiny
[SPEAKER_00]: objects that can occur due to the flash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have the flash is indirect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take the flash point upwards of
the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it's directly on the image and you
can see how it really distorts it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This adds enough lights you can see in
detail that doesn't distort anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no any reflections because this
can demonstrate flash that's either
[SPEAKER_00]: removed from the camera body creating the
angle or bounced off the ceiling or some
[SPEAKER_00]: other object because you want it to be
well lit which you do not want it to
[SPEAKER_00]: distort or kind of cause that blurriness
to occur due to the flash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just some important key items
to keep in mind when we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: studying our photography skills and making
sure that we're capturing quality images
[SPEAKER_00]: that really depict what was seen at the
crime scene.
