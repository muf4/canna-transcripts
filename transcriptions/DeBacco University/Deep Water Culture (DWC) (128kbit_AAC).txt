[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we'll look at deep water
culture, which is a form of hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically abbreviated DWC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a very simple and basic system
in this image here on the title slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deep water culture, the basics is growing
plants in aerated water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots grow into the nutrient solution
and it's splashed or bubbled continually
[SPEAKER_00]: on the growing roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see a tray of that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants can be grown in clay pellets or
rockwool held in a pot that is put into a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't just have to be the roots
hanging down in the bubbled or aerated
[SPEAKER_00]: water solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be supported by some form of
other substrate such as rockwool or these
[SPEAKER_00]: clay pebbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this setup is typically used with a
five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically they're sold as kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have very few moving parts,
but however, if the air pump fails,
[SPEAKER_00]: so can the entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's be mindful to get a quality air
pump and to keep a constant eye and
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers should aim for a pH around 6.0 to
6.5 in this setup to help keep their
[SPEAKER_00]: plants happy and the nutrients available
to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One caution growers should be is the root
based diseases as they can spread very
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly if conditions are not kept clean
and are monitored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's constantly looking at the plants,
looking at the above growth and making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that the below growth is also
adequate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if there is a disease that has
come in, it can spread through the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: crop very quickly as that water is being
aerated and circulated throughout all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants in the entire grow operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
