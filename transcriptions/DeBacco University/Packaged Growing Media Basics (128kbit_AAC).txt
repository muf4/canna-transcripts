[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to look at some of
the basics of packaged growing media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's nice and easy, comes in these
bags, potting mix, potting soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's learn a little bit about what
actually might be in that bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at packaged mixes, well,
they're easy to buy in large quantities in
[SPEAKER_00]: the very efficient process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically they come sterilized,
which is great, often contain wetting
[SPEAKER_00]: agents and can be purchased to match
specific growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, there's a lot of
benefits to going with the packaged mixes
[SPEAKER_00]: root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now packaged label versus content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want you to be warned here that the
package may stay the same or the exterior
[SPEAKER_00]: package may stay the same, but the soil
media components or percentage of them may
[SPEAKER_00]: change unexpectedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen this happen where you kind of
buy one thing and you get the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: or you think you're ordering the same
thing and it comes in the same package,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's something doesn't seem right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because potentially the
percentage of the components within that
[SPEAKER_00]: mix may have changed from the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be mindful of that when you're
buying or buying a batch of what you think
[SPEAKER_00]: is the same soilless media again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's also the package change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So other times the package may change,
but still the same material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of the flip case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you see three different pro mixes and
this is ideally the same inside material,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can see that the packaging may be
very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, it could be the very
same inside material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may get one thing that comes in
white, then it comes in black,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it comes in white again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just be mindful in checking and
knowing what the ingredients were on the
[SPEAKER_00]: previous mix that you used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now product frustration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in both of these situations,
this can be frustrating as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically buying in bulk, it's like I
did here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're ordering, be careful and
watch the first run of plants with this
[SPEAKER_00]: new material.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy in bulk, it gives you that
consistency and depending on the size of
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow operation, which you want to be
mindful of the frustrations that can occur
[SPEAKER_00]: with the change in the outside or more
frustrations usually change with the
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage or the recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So media bags, keep in mind that they're
measured in volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watch for compressed versus loose
package methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here this is a 3.8 cubic foot compressed
bale and this is a 2.8 cubic foot bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just be mindful of what you're
buying and what volume you may need
[SPEAKER_00]: because this can impact how much you need
or what type of end use you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the compressed bales are great for
large applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit harder to move, smaller bags,
easier to move, but less total volume of
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at potting soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this does contain soil as it says in
the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil is the main component with other
ingredients such as perlite and peat moss
[SPEAKER_00]: are added to improve the availability to
be used in a container environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This offers easy access to good base
growing media, provides great root
[SPEAKER_00]: penetration, stable, often near neutral
pH, often drains well, maintains constant
[SPEAKER_00]: qualities for the duration of the growing
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: All a lot of positives associated with
this type of bag mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it as soil out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It often has a consistent texture and
wetting agents to aid in the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: retain water while still allowing the
importance for air for those roots debris.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to use a quality company and
product when you're well familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cutting costs here will result in more
expenses and frustrations later.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go kind of with that what's on sale
mode, that can affect you potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind though that there are changes
within companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be mindful when you're buying in
bulk to kind of be mindful of exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what's in there and to be able to deal
with those situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil less are what's called potting mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are very popular for the value they
provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're relatively inexpensive and
lightweight compared to soil and sterile
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't contain soil, which is the
reason why they're called soil less mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do retain moisture and provide good
drainage for aggressive root growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: offer an easy controlled medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They buffer pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have fertilizer and moisture to
make for a stable growing medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this soil less mixes,
even though they contain no soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: can offer a very beneficial environment
for your roots and for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These soil less mixes, again, are very
popular for this reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're commercially produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're lightweight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They maintain consistent air and moisture,
good root penetration, drain well,
[SPEAKER_00]: come with different blends to match
specific needs, such as termination mixes,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing mixes, even orchid blends,
which are very high porosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're typically consistent in near
neutral pH, allowing the grower to not
[SPEAKER_00]: need to do any modifications to them upon
arrival.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages of the growing medias are
starting with clean conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent particles and contents.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, at least most of the time,
presence of wetting agents, typically near
[SPEAKER_00]: neutral pH requiring no adjustments from
the grower, ease of storage in getting
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage of growing medias is a
lack of consistent product over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Companies can make changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, sometimes they call them
improvements to their formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something that's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be frustrating from a grower
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purchasing, shipping, and storing can be
potential other issues, especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to buy in bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reusing the media is often not
recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Discarding media with the plants to avoid
carrying over disease or potential
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens, which could jeopardize your new
or next crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this does create a disposal
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on how much you use,
depending how big of an issue you can
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often the byproduct can be incorporated
into garden soil as other means of
[SPEAKER_00]: disposal or basically reusing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reusing it in a container base,
those wetting agents will degrade over
[SPEAKER_00]: time and it's not advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, well, if we were talking about
soil mixers, well, why not just use soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, both offer a buffering system,
which can be forgiving of grower errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, both require a lot of time and
labor to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: For containers, soil mixers are the way to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil is best for field grown conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil less mixes are best for potting or
container grows because of the wetting
[SPEAKER_00]: agents and the ability to handle that
little bit more stressful environment.
Soil mixers are the way to go.
Soil mixers are the way to go.
