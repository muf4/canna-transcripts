[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to selecting a substrate,
it can be a very difficult decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on this Tobacco University video,
we're going to take a scientific approach
[SPEAKER_00]: to comparing different growing substrates
for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into this study here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, this is a citation for the
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to look at it in more detail,
here's the first page and here's the link
[SPEAKER_00]: and the proper citation for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at any substrate,
what are growers typically looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking for high porosity of
fast-draining substrate that maintains
[SPEAKER_00]: moderate water content between
irrigations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also quick dry-downs to reduce the risk of
root rots and pathogens developing,
[SPEAKER_00]: well-balanced physical and chemical
properties, high consistency, and free of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds, seeds, and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it has those properties, most growers
are going to be seriously considering that
[SPEAKER_00]: to put their plants into grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's main categories talked about
in this study provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got rockwool, phenolic foam,
peat-based, coir-based, and living soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put just a little caption here from the
article here for their table one,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at their physical properties of
peat-based mix, how the height of the
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate can impact certain things like
easy available water, total available
[SPEAKER_00]: water, air-filled porosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just measures that these researchers
were taking and looking at the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the height of that substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with rockwool here at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rockwool, if you're not familiar with
it, is made from basalt rocks or other
materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which are liquefied at very high
temperatures and then spun into fibers
[SPEAKER_00]: that then can be made into different sizes
and shapes, blocks, cubes, and slabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the high consistency here
because it is a man-made material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a man-made material,
you can see the holes and that can allow a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower to take a smaller plug and place
that right into the rockwool cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now rockwool can hold more nutrient
solution in air than any other growing
[SPEAKER_00]: medium that I'll talk about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's favored particularly in these
large-scale operations because it is
[SPEAKER_00]: lightweight inert soil-less substrate
provides moderate to good aeration,
[SPEAKER_00]: excellent water holding capacity,
low CEC, easy to handle and use,
[SPEAKER_00]: homogeneous, very consistent, durable,
and pathogen-free, at least when you first
[SPEAKER_00]: get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, microbial life does develop in
rockwool during the growth cycle of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now general benefits of rockwool are that
the airspace makes oxygen, water,
[SPEAKER_00]: and nutrient solution easy accessible to
plant roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: All good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high air capacity and high ratio of
easily available water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwool has a very low unavailable water
which is bounded up water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water that's there but the plants can't
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very low in rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Promotes good root growth, provides even
drainage, drains well, and has uniform
[SPEAKER_00]: wetting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, all the things that I really
talked about there from seedling to
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative stage all the way into
flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has these great properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would anyone choose anything else
but rockwool?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are some downfalls to
rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some challenges with rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no perfect medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwool is not environmentally friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being the durability that it has during
the growing cycle really doesn't make it
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to dispose of at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwool may require the use of a wetting
agent to reduce the hydrophobicity,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is repelling of water that it may
have, at least initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those wetting agents can be washed out
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwool may dry out too fast at the end
of the season when plants are really
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressively moving transpiring water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also due to its zero CEC, fertilizers or
nutrients can easily leach out and could
[SPEAKER_00]: be wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwool typically has a high pH,
which requires adjustments by the grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the low buffering capacity requires
the grower to continuously monitor those
[SPEAKER_00]: pH levels to keep them in the desired
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can restrict the root environment even
if using the large slabs, especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing plants to full size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And algae growth, as we can see here,
is common as it stays moist and can clog
[SPEAKER_00]: emitters, increase disease and insect
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they do make little caps to put over
those to help reduce some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see they're wrapped on the side,
so that can be hopefully mitigated a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit by reducing the amount of light
that the top of that rockwool gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the irrigation of rockwool,
high frequency and low volume,
[SPEAKER_00]: and flow irrigation is recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many irrigation events, but low volume,
which each of those events is key to
[SPEAKER_00]: rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help reduce the leaching of
nutrients and keep the material moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: When fully dry, rockwool can become
hydrophobic and actually will repel water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could use a flood and drain system,
as we can see over here, or we can also
[SPEAKER_00]: use the drip emitters on this side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now phenolic foam is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not have heard of it in that
particular name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a relatively new sterilized soilless
substrate that comes in a range of sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenolic foam has that consistent texture,
excellent aeration, moderate to low water
[SPEAKER_00]: holding capacity, superior drainage,
and it really helps keep the top surface
[SPEAKER_00]: dryer limiting the algae growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit more of an advantage
in that department compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: rockwool we just talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But visually it looks kind of similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's often compared to rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can see, it does have that same
physical look to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also presented as an alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: No important CEC or buffering capacity,
which means neither reacts nor changes
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient based solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenolic foam is easy to handle and to use
with no need to protective gear or
[SPEAKER_00]: clothing when handling.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it is more fragile than rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be careful when you are
handling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like rockwool though, phenolic foam is
usually non-biodegradable and therefore
[SPEAKER_00]: can remain as waste and persist in the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which again, great to grow the plants in,
but we have to think about the full cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: even after we produce our crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we're comparing our two,
you can see rockwool right over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwool and phenolic foams are inert,
homogeneous, consistent, and free of
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens and microorganisms, at least
when you go to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwool and phenolic foams exhibit
excellent physical properties such as high
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios of easy available water in
airspace, even after heavy watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to be careful with our watering
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: The geometry of the substrate,
meaning the height and the width can
[SPEAKER_00]: impact these physical properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are cubes and there also are come in
slab form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selected irrigation is important to ensure
optimum water, air, and nutrients to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that should be low volume,
but many frequent applications throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the day that probably increase as those
plants get larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now again, those environmental issues,
we can't forget about those because both
[SPEAKER_00]: are not easily recyclable or reusable.
[SPEAKER_00]: After they're used for the growing
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: High volumes can lead to leaching,
which is common, meaning those nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: are getting past the root zone and getting
washed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can lead to water contamination with
fertilizers and or pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever is being applied to the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as simply as a grower, you're losing
that nutrients, you're losing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're increasing that expense with no
return.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is rockwool insulation,
but the same thing can be applied to the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing cubes and slabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do with them after and how do
you properly and responsibly dispose of
[SPEAKER_00]: them?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to irrigation,
it is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at both of these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's frequent irrigation events
achieved through the use of substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors and automated irrigation systems
can help maintain volumetric water near
[SPEAKER_00]: container capacity because the goal is to
prevent excessive leaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, probably a little bit will come out
the bottom, but don't want to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: leaching out those through the entire
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see here the automatic setup
here, easily repeatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just simply get spaced out more
as those plants get larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, moving on from Rockwell, other
competitors to think about would be a peat
[SPEAKER_00]: based substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are typically harvested in Canadian
sagram peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bogs are from Eastern Europe countries,
mainly Scandinavia and the Baltics,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending where your end product is being
grown or shipped to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The species can vary of the peat from bog
to bog, as well as one region to another,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is a quote once living product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The addition, of course, peat fibers or
the mixture of fibers or chunky materials
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted from the bog to the peat moss
can be used to increase the piece
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to shrinkage and compaction,
helping to maintain the physical
[SPEAKER_00]: properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly, growers don't want their substrate
to change throughout the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want that to remain consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the manufacturers may add some things
to help reduce the compaction or shrinkage
[SPEAKER_00]: that could occur from peat moss if it's
grown in as just a pure small fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the peat moss there is a high
buffering capacity for water, pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is acidic, hydrophobic and low in
nutrients, at least as itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additives are incorporated to make it a
suitable growing media for plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: typically you're not growing in straight
peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some modifications to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a scanning electron microscope
view of what a peat moss particle looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really zoomed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see all the little pores there
that help give it its unique properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also is a spongy structure,
so it can compress without lignified
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lignified fibers material may originate
from other species growing in the peat
[SPEAKER_00]: bog, if any.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just change a little bit from
peat bog to peat bog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So peat is rarely grown in alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say alone, that means just as an
isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat-based substrates usually show lower
aeration and gas exchange rate compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: other categories, mainly due to the
particle size and potential for shrinkage.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, peat often has materials
added to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those materials could be perlite wood or
wood fibers and many others manufacturers
[SPEAKER_00]: may choose to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal is to improve the overall
physical properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since peat is a living byproduct,
there can be variations from the peat
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sagrum peat moss is usually mixed with
other components to improve the physical
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those physical characteristics are to
help increase its aeration, to reduce its
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrophobicity, meaning repelling of
water, and to improve its CEC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at the common components
that wouldn't potentially be added to
[SPEAKER_00]: peat-based growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perlite, vermiculite, wood fiber,
even coir could be added, compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole bunch of different ones here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their typical distribution in what
properties are being added are listed
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're buying some peat-based
substrates, they may have other components
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at straight peat making your
own, consider adding some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: components to improve these various
physical properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the properties versus the overall
usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat-based substrates show greater
buffering capacity for water, pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: and nutrients when compared to rockwool
and phenolic foams, but is often less
[SPEAKER_00]: popular than both of rockwool and phenolic
foam category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now going to coir-based here, we're
looking at it's considered a byproduct of
[SPEAKER_00]: the coconut industry now being repurposed
for crop production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great way to turn a waste
product into something that's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: usable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common growing media for this category are
pure coir, which would be just kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: loose base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be expandable blocks, which are
various formulations of coir, pith,
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber, and husk chips that basically will
expand when water is added to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see cannabis plants growing in
those right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's coir blocks, there's grow bags,
there's grow slabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a lot of different forms of this
same base material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coir also has a fairly high cation
exchange capacity and therefore can help
[SPEAKER_00]: retain nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something to consider compared to some
of the others talked about previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the properties, again, here's a nice
little scanning electron microscope view
[SPEAKER_00]: of the coir particle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Various particle sizes from fine dust to
large chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, again, they're all coir,
but they have a very different variance
[SPEAKER_00]: there in their size.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hold high volumes of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have hydrophilic properties,
so be mindful of that particularly early
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have a tough structure,
excellent wettability, and can re-wet
[SPEAKER_00]: easily, reducing the need for wetting
agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something that's going to remain
consistent throughout the growing cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a slow breakdown rate and
therefore shrink during production cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: and can have higher aeration in drainage,
but this can depend on the size and
[SPEAKER_00]: particle distribution of the particular
product that you are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now often the coir base is seen as a
alternative to rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's rockwool and here's our coir
base.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aeration and drainage can be similar
to rockwool, so that's something growers
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to like.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, rockwool is not easily recyclable
or reusable after, where the coconut coir
[SPEAKER_00]: products can be relatively sustainable,
can potentially be reused, can actually be
[SPEAKER_00]: chopped up, can actually be composted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's things that could be done with
those that are simply not possible with
[SPEAKER_00]: rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with coir, again, no perfect media,
so we have to consider salts because the
[SPEAKER_00]: coir can have high salt levels if it's not
washed or buffered.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, salts are relatively soluble and
leachable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like it's going to stay in
there forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be leachable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to try to do this before we put
our plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The salts that need to be, that tend to be
found in this is sodium, potassium,
[SPEAKER_00]: chloride, and therefore may cause a risk
of calcium and magnesium deficiency in
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, which is why a CalMag fertilizer
is highly recommended to have on hand if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're choosing this growing substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: These elements must be mitigated or
replaced with more beneficial ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's why CalMag can help do that
over a period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now coir dealing with those salts,
how do we go about dealing with those
[SPEAKER_00]: salts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some manufacturers wash coir with
fresh water to remove excessive salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, triple washed on this
package here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But users should test to make sure that
they are sufficiently low enough for their
[SPEAKER_00]: liking, and that can be done with a
pour-through and taking the EC or the PPM
[SPEAKER_00]: of the flushing water through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another technique is to use certain
mineral salts, most common calcium salts,
[SPEAKER_00]: during the washing to force the exchange
of excessive elements with more beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: elements with the resulting products
saying to be buffered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see something that's buffered,
a lot of times that's not just washed with
[SPEAKER_00]: pure water, it's washed with a
calcium-containing water to help replace
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those non-desirable elements with
more desirable ones from a plant-growing
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buffering is this chemical process which
excessive sodium and potassium bound to
[SPEAKER_00]: the coir are replaced by calcium to help
prevent a calcium and magnesium deficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: during the growing cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still good to have those products on hand
though because those plants will probably
[SPEAKER_00]: be consuming those.
[SPEAKER_00]: A period of time is allowed for the
exchange to take place and then leached
[SPEAKER_00]: and dried to the open air.
[SPEAKER_00]: The efficacy of the buffering is variable
among manufacturers and depends on the
[SPEAKER_00]: volume of water for leaching, the
buffering salts used, and the time period
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed for the cation exchange to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all things that need to be taken into
consideration which is why it's good for
[SPEAKER_00]: growers just to double-check their
pour-throughs and to watch their plants as
[SPEAKER_00]: they're growing to make sure they have
that cow-mag on hand just in case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the aeration of coir, the high
aeration of coir helps maximize the root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone for the crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased root growth leads to increased
water and nutrient uptake, lack of oxygen,
[SPEAKER_00]: poor aeration in the root zone is a strong
contributing factor for the infection and
[SPEAKER_00]: spread of root pathogens, something
growers really want to avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why aeration is so important in
these substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coir does have the reputation for being
difficult to overwater and is associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with reduced instance of disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, all beneficial things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to overwater it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in the finer particles, it does have
a tendency to drain through pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using the larger particles, even easier to
pour through, but keep in mind that may
[SPEAKER_00]: require adjustments to your irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, no perfect media.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the drawbacks or
disadvantages?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, coir products tend to have higher
variation of particle size and chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: properties such as their salt levels,
their concentrations of sodium,
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium and chloride, and the amount of
buffering that they do have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always recommend having that cow-mag
on hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at the comparisons of our
coir, they tend to be more flexible to
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation management.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be easily adopted to low or high
frequency irrigation strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to peat, coir usually shows
better physical properties, aeration being
[SPEAKER_00]: one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And compared to rockwool and phenolic
foams, coir has a higher buffering
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity for water pH as well as
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we can see it kind of in the grow
bag form here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When switching from rockwool to phenolic
foams, the coir-based substrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a need to adjust irrigation
strategy because the water dynamic is
[SPEAKER_00]: different in those materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't think I'm just going to change
substrates and keep everything the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch those irrigation events because more
than likely adjustments will need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now moisture retention in curves for
soilless media, we can see that coir is
[SPEAKER_00]: most similar to peat moss and rockwool and
phenolic foams are also similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we can see the kind of water
potential and the volumetric water,
[SPEAKER_00]: how different things track.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going from kind of a
coir-based kind of to more of a peat
[SPEAKER_00]: moss-based, the irrigation changes might
be minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going from either a coir or
peat moss to a rockwool or phenolic foam,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could see those have vastly different
properties there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's some of the physical properties
of rockwool, foam, coir and the coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat moss, looking at the total porosity,
container capacity, so on and so forth,
[SPEAKER_00]: just so you can have an idea of what the
actual physical properties are of a media
[SPEAKER_00]: or substrate that you're using or when
you're considering or when you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: considering changing to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now lastly, I want to talk about living
soils, which is a category of its own,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really doesn't have any really defined
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be as simple as incorporating
microbial inoculants into growing medium,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it can be much more complex than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living soil matrix must support microbial
populations, and biodiversity is important
[SPEAKER_00]: to maintain a balance between
mineralization, plant protection,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as bio-stimulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic components of living soil are
peat moss, coir, coir chunks, naturalized
[SPEAKER_00]: bark, wood fiber, compost, and natural
additives, with no set percentage of any
[SPEAKER_00]: of these determined under the definition
of living soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: A variety of inoculants can also be used
in living soils, such as compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial inoculants, mycorrhizae,
which is a fungal-based, and tinomyces,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to name a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, living soil is not free of
challenges, as well as the other
[SPEAKER_00]: substrates that I talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So challenges living soils, maintaining a
balance between mineralization,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant protection, and bio-stimulation is
important, as well as optimizing physical
[SPEAKER_00]: properties, which I'll talk more about,
provide enough nutrients for the complete
[SPEAKER_00]: growth cycle, manage irrigation to prevent
leaching of nutrients as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk all about those three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Properly defining living soil is needed,
as this helps with setting standards for
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison when you're talking about
substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, optimization of those physical
properties will non-living soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: fast-draining, coarse, well-aerated
substrate properties allow for leaching of
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive nutrients and daily nutrient
feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living soil's physical properties,
the water and air exchange, can be limited
[SPEAKER_00]: due to the materials that are being chosen
to use, for example, compost, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: often used.
[SPEAKER_00]: The living soil component, microorganisms,
can also modify the substrate structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's an important variable to take into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, providing nutrients for the full
growth cycle, as I said, that can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge because nutrient availability is
a second challenge when we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: our living soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis grows very fast in a short period
of time, typically eight to 14 weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: and needs nutrients to rapidly become
available in high concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living soil can struggle to have enough
available plant nutrition to meet the high
[SPEAKER_00]: demand of this growing cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers often overcharge their growing
media with more than necessary amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: natural fertilizers to ensure the
availability for the full growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a balance, though, between
toxicity and plant-available nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: that growers need to take into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants growing and living soil tend to be
slower compared to soil-less substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: options, so keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also important to know that the
plant's going to need different nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: as it goes through its different life
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, just because you're high in one
nutrient doesn't mean you can maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: that one nutrient really high throughout
the entire growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be the plant demands for
shifting nutrients as it goes from that
[SPEAKER_00]: seed leading to that vegetative to that
flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, to manage irrigation to
prevent leaching of nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation strategies, a third challenge
in living soil, mainly due to the variance
[SPEAKER_00]: of the physical properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulating the plant's irrigation is how
growers manage air-to-water ratios in the
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone, and it's not as forgiving as
some of the other soil-less substrates we
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about really allows that water to
kind of pour through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, lastly, to end here with the best
growing substrate, I figured I should come
[SPEAKER_00]: to some conclusion here, since if you have
tuned in for this long, it's not as easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to suggest what growing media is the best
growing media for cannabis production
[SPEAKER_00]: because each category has its strengths as
well as its weaknesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And choosing any of these categories
depends a lot on the growers' technique
[SPEAKER_00]: and the production system you are
utilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take into account many factors when
selecting what substrate to utilize and
[SPEAKER_00]: try to make a wise decision with the
information presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have no idea where to start,
I would say coir-based products are
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the intermediate substrates
showing more advantages and less
[SPEAKER_00]: weaknesses if you're looking for a
starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expanded coir bags allow for minimal
storage space if you're looking at a
[SPEAKER_00]: large-scale operation, sterile starting
conditions, and supportive growing
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you like this very long but
detailed look at substrates to allow you
[SPEAKER_00]: to make an informed and scientific-based
decision for what your plants will be
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in.
