[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over whether we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: using landrace or heirlooms when we're
describing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times for cannabis,
landrace is used and for tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: heirlooms is used.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what should we be using for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the correct term to be using?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll answer that here in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so properly naming plants when
we're looking at landrace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Landraces of crops are most closely
aligned with heirlooms being that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are indigenous to certain regions and
developed their characteristics in
[SPEAKER_00]: response to the growing conditions of that
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Landrace plant species are relatively rare
because many have been supplemented to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed crops and have died out due to the
changing climate and also through human
[SPEAKER_00]: intervention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of just when we look at properly
naming heirlooms, this had typically done
[SPEAKER_00]: with or thought of to be done with
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heirlooms are open pollinated plants that
have been passed down from generation to
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are living artifacts and living
history exhibits and they're considered a
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir for genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're open pollinated,
these cultivars mean that the plants grown
[SPEAKER_00]: from seed will be true to type and will
resemble the plant from which it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants, however, can cross-pollinate
and therefore care
[SPEAKER_00]: for landrace plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a breakdown between what a true
landrace is and what the definition of an
[SPEAKER_00]: heirloom is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at the heirloom
classification, so there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: confusion as to how old a variety must be
to be classified truly as an heirloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some believe that any variety grown before
1951 when the first hybrids became
[SPEAKER_00]: available is an heirloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, many heirlooms are 100 to 150
years old or even much older than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In regards to vegetables, seed-saving
gardeners have kept their heirloom
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties alive as has the seed savers
exchange in Iowa there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of reserving those seeds and
kind of keeping that preserved for genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: use potentially in the future as a
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we go about naming a hybrid as
you know just another idea we heard
[SPEAKER_00]: landrace, heirlooms, what about hybrids I
often get asked?
[SPEAKER_00]: A hybrid is a result of pollinating one
specific variety of a class of plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen of another genetically
different variety of that same class.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the hybrid can occur by chance
within the seed industry, hybrids are
[SPEAKER_00]: result of cross-breeding of carefully
chosen parent plants that produce
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring or seeds that will have special
characteristics on genetics that go behind
[SPEAKER_00]: this and a lot of looking at kind of
different family trees and kind of looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at what the goal is to ultimately develop
in a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: By controlling the pollination process,
this results in the offspring having
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic characteristics from both parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: The offspring or seeds of this cross is
called an F1 hybrid and F1 stands for
[SPEAKER_00]: first finale.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds from this cross will produce
plants that are very uniform in plant
[SPEAKER_00]: habit and carry a combination of traits
from both parent plants and hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: those both traits that are carried over
are both considered to be advantageous in
[SPEAKER_00]: that resulting offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So landlace versus heirlooms looking
that's kind of the direct comparison here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Landraces are wild cannabis strains that
grow throughout the world free of contact
[SPEAKER_00]: with humans so they retain their genetics
and characteristics specific for that
[SPEAKER_00]: environment in which they're growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heirlooms are landrace is grown in a
non-native environment that's a key
[SPEAKER_00]: distinction characteristic there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heirloom strains have not been genetically
crossed or pollinated in specific way but
[SPEAKER_00]: have been brought from their place of
origin and cultivated by humans in a new
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this same plant grown out here in the
wild because they're in a land race you
[SPEAKER_00]: move that to a different growing location
extreme though in an indoor environment
[SPEAKER_00]: that would then classify that then
technically as an heirloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why does heirloom need to be used more
particularly in regards to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing a plant outside of the
postulated domestic area you are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: an heirloom or hybrid and not a landrace.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only a landrace if it's being grown
in its native geographic environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're moving that plant from
wherever it was naturally grown to any
[SPEAKER_00]: other location you're really not growing a
landrace you're technically growing an
[SPEAKER_00]: heirloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again so why that needs to be used a
little bit more kind of defined by growers
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the landrace seed kind of misconception
while growers want to have the original
[SPEAKER_00]: landrace variety if you're growing it out
of the native area then you're growing an
[SPEAKER_00]: heirloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Landrace requires both the seed or the
clone or plant material and the location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heirlooms just need the seed or the clone
or plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see the best landrace seeds and
landrace cannabis strains of Asia well
[SPEAKER_00]: taking them out of Asia or even out of the
area within Asia that they're being grown
[SPEAKER_00]: well we need to be using the term
heirloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be a change for a lot
of people but that's the true scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: reasoning for that change and I know it's
a hard concept to get across but here at
[SPEAKER_00]: DeBakel University the goal here is to
provide you with the true scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: answer even though it may not be what's
popular or currently accepted in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
