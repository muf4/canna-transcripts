[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this Tobacco University video,
we're going to be looking at vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure deficit and how it relates to
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into how vapor
pressure deficit impacts cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, it's typically
abbreviated VPD and it will be throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: this presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an advanced method for
understanding and measuring the indoor or
[SPEAKER_00]: technically outdoor growing environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: For outdoor, it's more used for monitoring
and for indoor, you can calculate the VPD
[SPEAKER_00]: and then make changes to your growing
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does require more equipment to gather
information and understanding of the
[SPEAKER_00]: overall growing environment, which is why
this is considered to be a more advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the vapor pressure of the air
taken into consideration, the leaf vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure, and together, these information
being used to get the VPD, the vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure deficit between those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the equipment that you need,
you need a thermometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you need to have an idea of what
the air temperature is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also need a hygrometer, which is
basically measuring the humidity in the
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an infrared IR thermometer,
because that is going to be used to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide the temperature of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the data generated, you can calculate
the VPD of the growing space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that the VPD does take
into account the entire environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows a consistent measure that
takes into account three main variables
[SPEAKER_00]: within any given growth space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at the influences on
VPD, one is transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: As VPD increases, the plant is going to
transpire at a greater rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to move water through its
material at a greater rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stomata opening, as VPD increases,
the stomata gets smaller or basically
[SPEAKER_00]: start to close up.
[SPEAKER_00]: For carbon dioxide uptake, as VPD
increases, the stomata gets smaller and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to reduce or restrict carbon
dioxide uptake because those stomata are
[SPEAKER_00]: pores in the underside of the leaf
allowing for gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they're smaller or get closed up,
we cannot have as much carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: being taken into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then nutrient intake at the root
level, increasing VPD and transpiration
[SPEAKER_00]: rates will mean the roots will pull more
nutrients, which can be important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plant stress, increasing VPD will
increase the plant stress as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a great kind of summary chart
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cited in the description,
so if you want to go through and find the
[SPEAKER_00]: original source, you're more than welcome
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're also encouraged to kind of take
a screenshot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pause the video here and do a little
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the temperature of the area and
here we have degrees Fahrenheit and here's
[SPEAKER_00]: the relative humidity of the growing
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see where those match up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, your goal is to be in this nice
dark region, dark green region right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now vapor pressure, looking at conversion
factors because different meters read in
[SPEAKER_00]: different units, it's important to know or
be able to compare two different sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the most common unit of measure is
kilopascals or kPa.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, inches of mercury or ion of Hg is
also used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the conversion factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see if you have kPa and to get kPa
from inches of mercury, you multiply
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever reading you get in inches of
mercury by 3.386.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have kPa and want to get to
inches of mercury, you take your kPa
[SPEAKER_00]: reading and multiply it by 0.296 to get
your inches of mercury.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at hectopascals,
we see the conversion down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some suggested target levels of this
VPD by growth phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically as the plants get older,
we want to increase the VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probigation of early veg and again,
just general targets to shoot for 0.2 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.8 kPa.
[SPEAKER_00]: For late veg and early flower,
looking at 0.8 to 1.4 kPa.
[SPEAKER_00]: For mid flower to late flower,
1.2 to 1.5 kPa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, here's some other suggestions
and these are a great way to have that
[SPEAKER_00]: target level set, at least initially,
as you're looking at different phases of
[SPEAKER_00]: your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how does the environment impact the
VPD?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as you increase the temperature,
so does the VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And inversely, as you decrease the
temperature, so does the VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are directly correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, humidity, as you increase
humidity, you will decrease VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are inversely, an inverse
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply as you decrease humidity,
you will also increase VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get that inverse relationship there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you increase the light intensity,
you're increasing the light temps,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will also, sorry, increase the light
intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will increase the temperature of the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That light is impacting the leaf there.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that increase in leaf temperature,
that will also increase your VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decreasing the light intensity decreases
leaf temps and then decreases VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to give you an idea how these
three environments will impact this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now relative humidity at given
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So suggested values are required to
maintain ideal growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when the lights are on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this again, gives you kind of a
Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of that humidity there and looking at
that target ranges there for those VPDs as
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, sources in the description there if
you want to look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, gives you a good kind of
general target range to be aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now transpiration that was talked about,
this is movement of water in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water first enters the roots of the plant
and will travel through the plant and exit
[SPEAKER_00]: out small, regulated pores called the
stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: This general movement of water is called
transpiration and allows for nutrients to
[SPEAKER_00]: move through the plant and also is a
method of cooling the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the plants water that's uptake is
used for cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The humidity is considered to be around
100% inside the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this represents saturated vapor
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see roots in the ground,
water being absorbed mainly by the xylem,
[SPEAKER_00]: moving its way up through the plant and
coming out the leaves there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now transpiration, the details of
transpiration may be more details than you
[SPEAKER_00]: care to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at the kind of
properties of water, the hydrogen bonding
[SPEAKER_00]: of water, the adhesive and cohesive
properties of water, allowing them to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like work their way up the stem here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of the within the xylem
vesicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the xylem there's also phloem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phloem is more of the minerals and
nutrients and phloem can move up and down
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Xylem is basically going from what's
called the roots up to the shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see here that getting in the
intermolecular forces, the partial
[SPEAKER_00]: positive, partial negatives kind of
linking of these water molecules together,
[SPEAKER_00]: helping this move its way up through the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little kind of plant biology there
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's transpiration rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, transpiration rates will be faster
in hot and dry conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rates will slow in high humidity because
water has no place to evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it's hot and it's kind of you're
sticky, that's because you're evaporating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to evaporate to cool
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much moisture in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of have that sticky feeling at
high humidity conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stomata need to be regulated because
when they're open, they can let CO2 in for
[SPEAKER_00]: the photosynthetic process, which is
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, the plant is also
losing water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has to make sure it's adequately
hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants need to balance out the ability to
photosynthesize and also remain hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: General conditions here, we can see the
rate of transpiration increases with
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature to a certain point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it'll plateau.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though the temperature is
increasing, that kind of rate
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration is kind of flatline there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wind velocity, for those that have a fan
on their plants or growing in the outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, typically as the wind
velocity increases, so will the
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the humidity, as our humidity
increases, our rate of transpiration will
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease simply because the water within
the leaf has nowhere to evaporate to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the water is in order to evaporate
to, it's no point for the plant can take
[SPEAKER_00]: in more water, move it up through the
xylem, move it up through the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, the increased humidity,
that line water to escape out the stomata
[SPEAKER_00]: will decrease those transpiration rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this helps you better
understand the VPD and allows you to
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize the growing conditions of your
cannabis plants.
