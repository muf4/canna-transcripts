[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at the
transport and exchange of carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: and oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This occurs through the bicarbonate buffer
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about carbon dioxide
being carried in red blood cells in
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange for oxygen, that is what's
occurring in the broad sense, but here
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to look a little bit more at
the molecular level to understand in
[SPEAKER_00]: greater detail what's actually occurring
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to start off, the transport and
exchange of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemoglobin binds with oxygen within red
blood cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see this example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our hemoglobin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's changing shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one case, we have it deoxygenated.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one case, oxygenated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So deoxygenators are oxygenated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does change shape when bound with
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this hemoglobin is binding in the red
blood cells with the oxygen, this will
[SPEAKER_00]: cause more to diffuse into the blood
plasma from the blood plasma.
[SPEAKER_00]: In lungs, most hemoglobin molecules carry
a full load of oxygen, and that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: called our R state.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's known as our relaxed state.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when the hemoglobin is fully
oxygenated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, because it's occurring through
the process of diffusion, as we're binding
[SPEAKER_00]: our oxygen to our hemoglobin, more can
diffuse in from the blood plasma.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH also influences that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A decrease in pH causes greater release of
oxygen from hemoglobin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in cells metabolized glucose,
carbon dioxide is released into the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: This causes two main things to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: An increase in the carbon dioxide,
pressure of carbon dioxide, and hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: ion concentration in capillary blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, pH stands for the measure of
hydrogen ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're increasing our hydrogen ion
concentration, what we're essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: doing is decreasing our pH, causing
acidosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This decrease in pH, this acidic
environment, can weaken the hemoglobin to
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important that we don't let our blood
get too low or too acidic, because that
[SPEAKER_00]: can completely break apart our ability to
bind to oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, carbon dioxide is
transported into the blood in three main
[SPEAKER_00]: forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is dissolved in the plasma,
and this only accounts for about 7% to
[SPEAKER_00]: 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be chemically bound to hemoglobin,
since about 20% is carried in red blood
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's known as this very complex molecule
here, as carbaminohemoglobin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vast majority, or 70%, is transported
as a bicarbonate ion.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: HCO3, the minus sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bicarbonate ion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here, some is carried in
the red blood cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our bicarbonate ion dissolved in
the plasma as carbonic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the name kind of implies,
acidic environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we have some carbon dioxide
dissolved within the plasma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this carbonic acid, and this acid in
general, is something we want to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: track of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So transport and exchange of carbon
dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, looking at this kind of equation
here, if you're not familiar with chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: equations, this arrow means the reaction
is continuing this way, and a reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: arrow means the opposite is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So carbon dioxide diffuses in red blood
cells and combines with water to form
[SPEAKER_00]: carbonic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our carbon dioxide, combines
with water to form our carbonic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going this way, which will
quickly dissociate or break apart into
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen ions and bicarbonate ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in red blood cells, carbonic
anhydrase, we see here, is an enzyme,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that can reversibly catalyze the
conversion of carbon dioxide and water
[SPEAKER_00]: into carbonic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part is carbon dioxide in water
will break down and form carbonic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This carbonic acid can break apart,
or as we call it, dissociate into
[SPEAKER_00]: carbonate and hydrogen ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this hydrogen ion concentration,
if this gets too high, this will cause a
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease in our blood pH, creating a more
acidic environment, which can be very
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous to our blood respiratory and
circulatory system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at it here, a little more of a
pictorial level, at the tissue level,
[SPEAKER_00]: bicarbonate quickly diffuses from red
blood cells into the plasma.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chloride shift to counterbalance the
outrush of negative bicarbonate ions from
[SPEAKER_00]: red blood cells, chloride ions,
Cl-, move from the plasma into the
[SPEAKER_00]: erythrocytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this exchange of our negative
charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our oxygen moving, and this is
occurring at the tissue level that are
[SPEAKER_00]: respiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're respiring, so they're requiring
oxygen that's going into the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we see, carbon dioxide is leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's leaving and going into different
forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, it's combining with the hemoglobin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, it's combining with the water to
form our carbonate ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, it's simply dissolving into the
blood plasma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, again, shows you pictorially the
three different steps that we talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: in this slide here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dissolved, chemically bound,
and bicarbonate ion, we see them all
[SPEAKER_00]: pictured here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxygen is simply diffusing into the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the lungs, these processes are simply
reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we see our carbon dioxide leaving
and our oxygen entering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bicarbonate ions move into the red
blood cells and bind to form with hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: ions to form carbonic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carbonic acid is then split by
carbonic and hydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, that's an enzyme to release
carbon dioxide in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon dioxide can also diffuse from the
blood to the alveoli.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is occurring in the alveoli within
the actual lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: High surface area, allowing for the this
exchange to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Influence of carbon dioxide on blood pH,
this is the important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carbonic acid and bicarbonate buffer
system resist blood pH changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is that buffer system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the acid and the bicarbonate kind
of playing off one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: If hydrogen ion concentrations in the
blood begin to rise, which is excessive
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen ions being added to the system,
they can be removed by combining with this
[SPEAKER_00]: carbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If hydrogen ion concentrations begin to
drop, carbonic acid can dissociate,
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing hydrogen ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because we have a way to both take in
excessive hydrogen ions and also release
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen ions, this is how we develop this
buffer system here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're able to buffer the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're able to, if something gets too high,
we can bring it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it gets down, we can start
bringing it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is maintaining our blood pH in
approximately that 7.35 to 7.45 level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very tight control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, where our respiratory rate can
change, can also alter our blood pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to provide a fast-acting
system to adjust pH when it's disturbed by
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolic factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going for a quick run in the
burst of energy, that could potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: shift our pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a way to quickly be able to
correct that and prevent it from getting
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of that normal range.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does, we could have our proteins not
function properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have reduced oxygen levels to
certain parts of the body, and all
[SPEAKER_00]: negative things could basically happen if
this buffer system was to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep in mind we have this bicarbonate
buffer system, and this carbon dioxide and
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen exchange that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully now you can appreciate
what's occurring a little bit more at the
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular level.
Thank you.
