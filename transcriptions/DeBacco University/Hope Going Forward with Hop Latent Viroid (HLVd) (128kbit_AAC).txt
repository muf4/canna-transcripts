[SPEAKER_00]: So on this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over the hope going
[SPEAKER_00]: forward with Hoplite and Viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a lot of doom and gloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to give some positivity here and give
you an indication of where this Viroid
[SPEAKER_00]: might be trending within the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so let's go over the hope going
forward with Hoplite and Viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, question a lot of growers are asking,
is it getting worse?
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, it's hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to tell if the Viroid is
actually spreading or if the awareness is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually spreading, and that's resulting
in more growers looking for this Viroid
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually identifying it and finding
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are we on an upward trend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we on a downward trend?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have more people looking for it,
and it is quite prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that doesn't necessarily mean it's
getting worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means we're just identifying something
that was already there before we were even
[SPEAKER_00]: screening for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it stresses the point of
testing, screening, and actually looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for it, not just turning a blind eye to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why should I be concerned as a grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it reduces yields, so that's kind of
a concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's not enough of a reason to be
concerned, the pathogen does easily
[SPEAKER_00]: spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is another concern to both your
operation as well as others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is no cure for this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we need to be mindful of this
test for this and cull those plants out as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as possible so we're not creating
more of a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, being aware is the key part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that comes through testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know what to look for and do
not be afraid to test your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think, oh, I don't think that's
hoplite and Viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test so that you have to know whether it
is hoplite and Viroid or something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carefully tell others because if you think
their plants might be infected or showing
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms, encourage them also to get their
plants tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, again, if they're showing
symptoms in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants can also have high Viroid loads in
the roots that will then lead to upper
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of the plant exhibiting symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be aware, testing is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots and leaves should be tested early on
in favor of the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Older plants, you can test the leaves,
particularly the petioles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this does not mean if you test
positive, you're an unclean grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like the, you know, we saw with
all the, you know, unclean, all the
[SPEAKER_00]: leprosy, all the negative correlations
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do have plants that test positive,
it is not indication of bad practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very prevalent Viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more important to test your plants
and know whether you have it so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: remove and implement protocols than to
just turn a blind eye to it and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: spread it to your operation as well as
potentially others' operation as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this again comes again with the value
of testing, seed testing, clone testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: asking for screening reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really important if you're
bringing plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they get tested for hoplite and
Viroid?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do they have any sort of
documentation for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it something, any new plants you get
in, it should be testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your mother plants, you should be testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of value in this testing
because that really allows you to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: plants early, remove of them, and
hopefully by discarding them, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: limiting the chance of it spreading to
many of your other plants and hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: saving your operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, finding resistant cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a great thing to date.
[SPEAKER_00]: No cannabis cultivars are known to be
resistant to hoplite and Viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some aren't showing potentially what we
call tolerance, meaning they're not as
[SPEAKER_00]: severely affected, but still succumbing to
this Viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, remember this is still a new
disease being identified and more
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars are now, more cultivars are
aware of this and will be actively seeking
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially having a resistant variety to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, screening and removing
plants is the most effective way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, sanitation protocols come along with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be aware of your workers, limit contact
with known infected plants, know who was
[SPEAKER_00]: around the infected plant, follow
sanitation protocols with products that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually work against hoplite and Viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohols do not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, your Vercon S and your bleach
are the only two that are really effective
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's for surfaces and tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really hard to clean the actual plant
material, so keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resides in the sap mainly and shows high
viral loads early on in the roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then will spread through the entire
plant in only about six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, this is a problem, but research is
ongoing, so sharing of information both at
[SPEAKER_00]: universities and also with companies and
getting more people aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing research on this is a way we can
start to understand this better and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully find a way to reduce its spread,
to know where it is, to remove those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and eliminate this from the entire
cannabis population going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
