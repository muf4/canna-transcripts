[SPEAKER_00]: So for growers who are irrigating,
a lot of times they want to add
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer, and an efficient way to do
that is with a fertilizer injector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's three different main types of
options that I'm going to include here to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at to make this process nice and
efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy Flow, Mazzy Injector, and Dosatron
are the three main types of fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: injector options for those looking even
hand watering options to link it right
[SPEAKER_00]: through the hose and piping that you're
already using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off is the Easy Flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of what it looks like,
and it hooks right up, you can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: example here to the faucet, and this is
what the internal structure looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very easy attachment that comes
right with the unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows growers to see the dilution of
fertilizer during the irrigation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this can reduce the flow because
if you notice you're kind of passing water
[SPEAKER_00]: through here, mixing it, pressurizing the
tank, and coming back out and adding it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the hose in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the flow can be reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also does not allow for precise
additions of the fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be another potential
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the water comes in here, runs through
the Easy Flow, and then comes out with a
[SPEAKER_00]: dilution rate of fertilizer, and then goes
out to the irrigation water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind with this and all the
systems, you should have some form of back
[SPEAKER_00]: flow preventer just to eliminate any
chance of this fertilizer getting back and
[SPEAKER_00]: back feeding into, in this case,
the household system or just the main
[SPEAKER_00]: water supply in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mazzy Injector will work based on Venturi
Flow and Suction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no moving parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used in small and large scale
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to match the flow rate to your
irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it does result in about 20% drop in
pressure and flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can be a negative if you're
already kind of at the limits of your
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Venturi system, as you can see where
you reduce the flow, it picks up the speed
[SPEAKER_00]: here, operates like a carburetor system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might be familiar with that in some
older cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of taking that system of
compressing here the total area and
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing the speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, the water would flow this
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be kind of this negative pressure,
this little suction effect that would draw
[SPEAKER_00]: up fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the outflow here, it'd be a
water fertilizer mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one here is called a Dosutron,
and I use that because it's kind of a name
[SPEAKER_00]: brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Dosutron, there's MiniDos,
there's Chemie Injectors, many different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes by a whole variety of names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dosutron is the name brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a water powered proportioner in
the sense that as the water flows by,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is actively moving pump in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the most expensive of the
options that I've talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has moving parts which do need to be
replaced because they do wear over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the advantage to these is there's
no pressure or flow restrictions
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with these type of injectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also install a bypass here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're not injecting, you can just
run clean water right through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does allow for very accurate dosing,
which is why they are advised to be used,
[SPEAKER_00]: simply because you can really dial in the
exact amount of fertilizer you want to add
[SPEAKER_00]: to your irrigation water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's their advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other downfall is they are the more
expensive option.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have some moving parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as growers, you've got to weigh all the
potential options available to you and
[SPEAKER_00]: pick the one that's the best fit for your
given conditions.
Thank you.
