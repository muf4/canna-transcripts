[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to put special
classification of hormones called sex
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these sex hormones are steroid
hormones and they're produced by the
[SPEAKER_00]: ovaries, testes, or adrenal cortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: They affect both growth and function of
reproductive organs as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: development of secondary sex
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three we're going to focus on in this
lecture series are testosterone,
[SPEAKER_00]: estrogen, and progesterone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this average hormone production
over age for sex hormone production in
[SPEAKER_00]: both men and women.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here it's clearly not
consistent over someone's lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be different ages that there
are certain peaks and drop-offs that
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Estrogen is typically considered the
female hormone and testosterone the male
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone even though they occur in both
genders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with testosterone, it is produced
in the ovaries in women, in the testes in
[SPEAKER_00]: men, and the adrenal glands in both
genders.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stimulates the development of what's
typically associated as male
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It plays an important role during male
puberty, sparking gross births,
[SPEAKER_00]: hair growth, and genital changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a male ages, the testosterone will
decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: At age 25, we're looking at here,
we have about 100 percent and we saw this
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly degradation as the male ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: At age 60, that same male will only have
about 45 to 50 percent of the testosterone
[SPEAKER_00]: they had when they were 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the influences of testosterone,
you can see different areas influenced
[SPEAKER_00]: here such as the skin, the brain,
the bone marrow, and muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Muscles in particular, it was involved
with increasing muscle mass and also
[SPEAKER_00]: strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testosterone may be used in certain
steroids or performance enhancing drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: because a lot of people want to increase
muscle mass and strength and testosterone
[SPEAKER_00]: is one hormone that can influence that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to estrogen, which is typically
considered the female hormone,
[SPEAKER_00]: it affects both men and women though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps control the menstrual cycle and
protects bone health and keeps cholesterol
[SPEAKER_00]: in control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also critical to fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's produced primarily in the ovaries,
which is produces in women's eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's also produced in the adrenal
glands, which also makes some of this
[SPEAKER_00]: estrogen, which is why both men and women
will have estrogen at least in small
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts for men because both have the
adrenal glands located near the kidneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last hormone here, progesterone,
is involved in fertility in menstruation
[SPEAKER_00]: and are largely controlled by hormones,
one of them being progesterone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It prepares the endometrium for potential
pregnancy after ovulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here a graph of how it's
changing during the menstrual cycle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also trigger the lining to thicken
and accept a fertilized egg in females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are just a quick overview of the
three sex hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
