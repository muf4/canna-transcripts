[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over a fusarium
wilt, and what we see on the title slide
[SPEAKER_00]: here is an image of what fusarium looks
like under the microscope, and this would
[SPEAKER_00]: be a pretty high degree of infection,
and hopefully on any of the plants you
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, no pathologist will see this in any
samples you bring them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the identification of fusarium,
it's a soil-based fungus that infects the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can happen to various degrees of
severity, so it's not just a
[SPEAKER_00]: one-size-fits-all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking here at very severe cases,
and here are very mild cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this can have this variance,
which makes it a little hard to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're to look where the plant will wilt as
a result of the root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves will quickly turn from a yellow to
a brown, and also have a curl to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this is noticed, it's advised to cut
into the stem and inspect the vascular
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue for browning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upon inspection of the roots, there may be
a red-orange coloration noticed once the
[SPEAKER_00]: media is removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see two plants here,
this is showing that vascular system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the upper portion still look
quite as bad, but especially down towards
[SPEAKER_00]: that soil line, we see that more tannish
yellowish and tannish orange coloration
[SPEAKER_00]: that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can progress to kind of this green
coloration and look almost normal at the
[SPEAKER_00]: top, but again, that vascular system is
infected here with fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll avoid reusing media, as this can
increase the odds of accumulating fusarium
[SPEAKER_00]: and infecting subsequent plantings.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is especially true for outdoor
operations that do not rotate plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil that's grown in.
[SPEAKER_00]: As part of a quality crop rotation,
using hairy vetch as we see, in this image
[SPEAKER_00]: here, to aid in organic matter and
nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great cover crop, as this can also
netline off those benefits, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially reduce fusarium well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been shown in areas of outdoor
operations that grow watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This hairy vetch, great organic matter,
supplement great nitrogen, and also a
[SPEAKER_00]: fusarium reduction in outdoor soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: For control, so once noticed the area
should be planted to be rotated to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the chance of building up fusarium in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you see a kind of mild
infection one year, don't think that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go away the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only going to get worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is via clean plants, so you're
starting to see infections early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to plant repeatedly
applications in there to get to more
[SPEAKER_00]: severe cases down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do see this, reducing nitrogen in
season and do not overwatering can help
[SPEAKER_00]: slow the progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: As fungicides only offer a reduction in
spreading and are not a curative measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important as a grower to recognize
this early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what you can to get by with the closing
out of that season and to know you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: rotate out for the following year,
two or even three or greater, if that is
[SPEAKER_00]: possible, to help reduce the chance of
getting fusarium well in future plantings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
