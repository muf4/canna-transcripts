[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this DeBaco University
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be going over some
growing substrate options for indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production, with other videos
going into more detail on the options
[SPEAKER_00]: presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at some of these
substrate and some of the options
[SPEAKER_00]: regarding cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, when we're growing typically
indoors, the goal of substrates is to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide physical support for the root
structure of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, yes, it can contain some
microbes, it can contain some fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the main purpose of that substrate,
or the properties of that substrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: is really to support a healthy root
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The physical morphology, if you will,
of the actual roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the properties of the substrate are
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those physical properties of the substrate
will impact how it interacts with the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while some substrates do contain some
starter nutrients, and that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: important, growers can add their own,
we really want to look at some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: physical properties of some of the
substrates, because we can usually add,
[SPEAKER_00]: or in some way, modify the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the physical properties are what we're
looking at in this general comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some common substrate options.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at just the general
substrates, there's soilless mix,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we can see here in the middle,
coco coir, and rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, soilless mix is used a lot,
not only in cannabis, but other indoor pot
[SPEAKER_00]: productions, indoor container productions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coco coir does get a lot of kind of
interest, in the sense that it does allow
[SPEAKER_00]: for the roots to spread out pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is generally considered to be inert,
but we do want to be mindful of the
[SPEAKER_00]: increase needing for Kelmag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then rockwool, a lot of times used in
the early part for the clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we see here, but can be used to grow
full-size plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the three most common
substrates that typically are found in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production, and you're welcome to
search the channel for more information on
[SPEAKER_00]: delving into the details of each of these
three presented here.
