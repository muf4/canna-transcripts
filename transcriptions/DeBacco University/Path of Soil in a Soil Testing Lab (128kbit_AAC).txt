[SPEAKER_00]: Ever wonder what soil has to go through
when you drop it off until the time you
[SPEAKER_00]: get the results?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well here on this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go through the path of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: in a soil testing lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in this video, while it is a
little bit longer, it's going to take you
[SPEAKER_00]: through step by step the process going
through a soil lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're fortunate enough to be allowed in at
the University of Connecticut,
[SPEAKER_00]: UConn soil lab, and Dawn will be our guide
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: She runs the lab and she walks us through
the entire process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's that process going to entail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the basic process is going to be
receiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start with the receiving of the soil,
where the soil's first process in the lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: paperwork and payment are checked,
the drying of those samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So samples are initially dried and while
growers should not be sending wet samples,
[SPEAKER_00]: this allows for consistent moisture levels
of all samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a grinding and sifting to
occur, which screen to screen out larger
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subsampling is provided to allow a
consistent volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see the ICP, which is the
inductively coupled plasma running
[SPEAKER_00]: machine, where it has extremely high
temperatures, basically hotter than the
[SPEAKER_00]: sun, to utilize and analyze different
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how organic matter is
calculated with the LOI or loss on
[SPEAKER_00]: ignition method, where essentially the
samples are burned off, the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: materials burned off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the sand, silt and clay
percentages, importance of determining pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus run on its own analyzer,
and then the end result or the report with
[SPEAKER_00]: some results and kind of some going
through the results with some specific
[SPEAKER_00]: guidance for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you Don again at the University
of Connecticut lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoyed the video here,
walking the process the soil takes through
[SPEAKER_00]: a soil lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever wonder what happens to your soil
after you collect it and before you get
[SPEAKER_00]: the numbers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to get to see the soil
testing lab here at the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecticut and the exact process that
your soil goes through while your lab here
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be generating the numbers for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the UConn soil testing lab in
April.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do about 10,000 soil samples a year and
about 3,000 of them we do in April,
[SPEAKER_01]: so this is our busiest month.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going as fast as we can,
but we are limited to how fast us and the
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment can work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The samples come in any way imaginable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come in in little packages,
they come in in boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do is, first the thing we do is we
open up your package.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really really like it when you fill out
our paperwork because it saves us a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking for a name, address,
phone number, and email so we can email
[SPEAKER_01]: you the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look to see that you gave us the right
correct amount of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know what test you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only need a cup of soil for our our
standard nutrient analysis and then we
[SPEAKER_01]: take the soil we spread it on little
pieces of paper and we're going to let
[SPEAKER_01]: them dry overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have fans and we have a heater and we
can spread about 300 soils to dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all soils that are drying and
then after we finish drying them the next
[SPEAKER_01]: day we'll start sifting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have a lot of red soils in
Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_01]: People think it's from because they're
clay soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't actually have a lot of clay soils
in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_01]: The red color is due to the iron,
so if you're ever driving down 84 and you
[SPEAKER_01]: see those red rocks along the road,
those are Triassic red sandstone and
[SPEAKER_01]: usually the red color denotes a pretty
well aerated soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also denotes soil kind of low in
organic matter because if it had more
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter the organic matter would
cover up the red color.
[SPEAKER_01]: After the soils dry we end up putting them
through a two millimeter sieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two millimeter sieve defines what soil
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mineral soil particles are less than two
millimeters in size.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put them through the sieve and then we
put them in numbered cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: These numbered cups we start with number
one and here we are in April and we're up
[SPEAKER_01]: to 2664 and then we do have a stamp so we
make sure that the paperwork is stamped
[SPEAKER_01]: with the same number that the soil goes
into in the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: We dry and sieve the soils and put them
into numbered cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to extract them because we can't
just take soil and pour it into our
[SPEAKER_01]: machines.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to use some sort of a liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that we do is like a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything goes top to bottom,
left to right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first cup is empty and that's because
it's our Czech soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have four different Czech soils or QCs,
quality controls, and we just rotate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have slightly different pH's and
amounts of nutrients in it and I see here
[SPEAKER_01]: that the next Czech soil we would use
would be number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to take some out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to get as level as we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it in our little Erlemeyer and tap and
then we can start putting our samples in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again we'll take a spoonful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll tap it until it's pretty level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it in our Erlemeyer and go on to the
next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what we're trying to do here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of like a little factory.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to make our end product or our
soil extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to make it so that we can read it
on all of our equipment and according to
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil test procedure that we use,
which is for a modified Morgan,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're taking four CC's.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a four CC scoop and we're going to
add 20 mils of this modified Morgan
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're doing a five-time dilution and
the reason why we're doing that is because
[SPEAKER_01]: about 95% of the samples that we are
analyzing will fall in the standard curve
[SPEAKER_01]: that we are using to calibrate the
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really want to do more dilutions
than we have to and this way anytime you
[SPEAKER_01]: do any kind of analysis you want to make
sure that what solution you're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: analyzing or whatever material you're
going to be analyzing will fall in the
[SPEAKER_01]: calibration range of the particular piece
of equipment that you're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people give us very tiny amounts of
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we really only need, you can see
these are three ounce drinking cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we sieve your soil and we mix them
up, this is what we put them into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do not need a really large amount of
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just really need about a cup of soil
for the standard nutrient analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this analysis runs, we do the pH,
we also do a buffer pH, which is not
[SPEAKER_01]: important to you, but it's how we make our
limestone recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we measure all the major plant
nutrients, calcium, magnesium,
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus, potassium, but we don't
measure nitrogen and we often get,
[SPEAKER_01]: people often ask, well, how can you make
nitrogen recommendations if you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: measure it for one?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they say, well, why don't you
measure it?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't measure it because it fluctuates
so widely in the soil depending upon
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental conditions that at best
would be giving you a snapshot of how much
[SPEAKER_01]: is in your soil today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at worst would actually be giving you
a false number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can make nitrogen recommendations
based on field studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that turf, for instance,
needs three pounds of nitrogen per 1,000
[SPEAKER_01]: square feet per year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pears only need one pound of nitrogen per
1,000 square feet per year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we measure all the other elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: We measure the trace elements like copper
and manganese and boron and zinc and iron,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we also do a lead scheme because
about 20% of the samples that we get
[SPEAKER_01]: actually have elevated lead levels in
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because we're, it's a very,
very old state Connecticut is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've used lead paint for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of old lead painted
buildings.
[SPEAKER_01]: They used to use lead in the gasoline and
lead arsenate was used as a pesticide in
[SPEAKER_01]: orchards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a lot of apple and pear
orchards in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since we're able to add that on when we
measure all the nutrients at no extra
[SPEAKER_01]: cost, we figure as a public service
option, it's a good thing for us to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we do do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our soils are extracted following the
recommended soil test procedures of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Northeast United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anybody wants to see that,
it's on the University of Delaware's
[SPEAKER_01]: website.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're part of a federal working group and
we've developed methodology for all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: states in the Northeast as far down as
West Virginia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're trying to do is we need to
remove from the soil the nutrients that
[SPEAKER_01]: are available to your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we use something called the modified
Morgan extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was invented by Dr. Morgan at the
Connecticut Ag Experiment Station in the
[SPEAKER_01]: forties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it does is this extraction
solution, it replicates what a plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: able to take out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we end up doing is we take four
cc's of the soil, and we add 20 mils of
[SPEAKER_01]: extracting solution, and we put them on
the shaker for 15 minutes and let them
[SPEAKER_01]: shake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we pour through filter paper and
then we get the extracts and the extracts
[SPEAKER_01]: of what we run in our equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep about a thousand soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just rotate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you need an extra test, say organic
matter, you need to call us up pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: quick in the springtime because as we're
running a hundred soils a day,
[SPEAKER_01]: within two weeks time, a thousand soil has
already been dumped.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pull any of those trays out if you
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: After we pour our samples, we wait for all
the extract to go through, and then we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get rid of all the filter papers
and take the funnels off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will wash our funnels out and
we'll have the test tubes filled up extra
[SPEAKER_01]: racks that can be run on our two pieces of
equipment to give you all of the elements
[SPEAKER_01]: that you need to grow good plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get our little rack.
[SPEAKER_01]: We write down the numbers of the ones
we're doing, put them in our little rack
[SPEAKER_01]: and bring them into the other room so we
can put them on the analyzer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extracted and they're in these little test
tubes, we get a clear extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't have a clear extract,
then we refill to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to run them on two
different types of analytical equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to run it on a discrete
analyzer to measure orthophosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to measure what put
it on an ICP to measure all the other
[SPEAKER_01]: elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't fit these test tubes on the,
um, discrete analyzer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to
pour a little bit in each of these cute
[SPEAKER_01]: little containers and put them in this
rack and
[SPEAKER_01]: then we'll set them up to run
orthophosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as you can see, our samples
aren't really very large that we end up
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important that whoever's
taking the soil sample do a good job in
[SPEAKER_01]: taking a representative sample so that the
small amount that we actually pull out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the sample is a good average of what you
actually have in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we're using about five,
five mils, maybe a little bit less.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once we get them all poured into
these little sample cups, we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: take the whole little rack and we're going
to put it in our discrete analyzer here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in there we have, we have different
reagents.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our matrix and we have a high
standard and this high standard will get
[SPEAKER_01]: diluted and put into these six little cups
and that's how we make our standard curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a, this is a discrete analyzer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it measures basically absorption.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens is that the sample probe
picks up some of the sample and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the reagent and it puts it in little
cuvettes and the cuvettes are kept in here
[SPEAKER_01]: and these little, and they put in these
little cuvettes and these little cuvettes,
[SPEAKER_01]: they incubate, they're on a heated tray
and they incubate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens is with the reagent,
the more phosphorus that's in the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: the darker the color blue it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what this machine is doing is it's
looking at how much light is absorbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So say for instance, you had a clear,
you had a cup full of clear Kool-Aid or
[SPEAKER_01]: clear water and then you had, and then you
had maybe another glass full of blue
[SPEAKER_01]: Kool-Aid, although this is not Kool-Aid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you shone a light through the clear
water, you'd be able to see almost all the
[SPEAKER_01]: light that goes through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you shone a light through your blue
solution, only some of the light would get
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest would get absorbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what, that's what this machine does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It measures the amount of light that's
absorbed and the more light that's
[SPEAKER_01]: absorbed, the higher concentration of
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to tell this to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'm going to do is I'm going to,
first I'm going to tell it what method to
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to use orthophosphate
method.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I need to tell it how many
samples, I have 48 plus I have a LCS,
[SPEAKER_01]: a least control standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to tell it the first number
we're on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll say, okay, load these
samples up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then it's going to load them all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just going to change the last one
to LCS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to ask it to save it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Save it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I want to call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: We typically just call it by the date.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then this is the first set of the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be A.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so now I'm going to call it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go into my system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could see this is where I loaded
all the samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my LCS.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are my reagents.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my high standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where it's going to make the
other standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to tell this to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to want it to do a water blank.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to calibrate, press the little
button.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in about two hours worth of time,
I should be able to get all my phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers off of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually making the standards now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took some reagent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took some standard and put it in those
little cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to mix it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually we'll get a curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look at the curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's like .999.
[SPEAKER_01]: It picks up a little bit of all the
reagents.
[SPEAKER_01]: It picks up a little bit of whatever
sample it wants to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it puts it in a cube.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's doing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it rinses itself off in a well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes get some more reagent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rinse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a curious little instrument.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes through that rinse process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rinses it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It knows exactly what it's supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It knows that you program it to how much
of each of these reagents to put in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The key is when you're programming this is
that you have to make sure you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: telling it to put more liquid in that can
be held in that little cube.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the coolest things about
this machine is that you just put in one
[SPEAKER_01]: high standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes all the standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes the curve for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what the results look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this reads the optical density.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is, remember I said that you have,
it's adding reagents that turn it bluer
[SPEAKER_01]: the more phosphorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be more dense the more bluer
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the higher optical density.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it translates that into the
concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how much you know how much
phosphorous is in your soil sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: You notice that some of the, this isn't
really great, but you notice some of them
[SPEAKER_01]: are a little bit darker than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically the ones that are a little bit
darker than others have a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: higher organic matter concentration in
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's really cool is to look at the
saturated media ones because some of them
[SPEAKER_01]: come out like copper, blue, or blue-green.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna grab this and put this on the
ICP.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all our standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we end up, we use standards to
calibrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are known amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have another least control
standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for all the elements except for
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have a separate one for
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every time we run, we calibrate and
then we run a known QC with the set.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technical difficulties here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we run known QCs with the
calibration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is our ICP.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stands for Inductively Coupled Argon
Plasma Spectrometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's run on plasma.
[SPEAKER_01]: A plasma is actually a force state of
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's solids, there's gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's liquids and there's plasma.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is 6,000 degrees centigrade.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually hotter than the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing that's neat about this is
we're able to run, this is an atomic
[SPEAKER_01]: emission.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if you remember back from
chemistry, but every single atom has a
[SPEAKER_01]: nucleus and around the nucleus it has
electrons that are traveling.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so hot that what this does is the
sample will pick up some of your sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will put it into the spray chamber.
[SPEAKER_01]: The spray chamber, and there's a little
nebulizer there, it breaks it all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the spray from the sample that
we poured goes into the plasma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what happens is the plasma is so
hot, it excites those electrons and it
[SPEAKER_01]: causes them to raise up out of their
characteristic ground state orbital.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when they do that, they're just
doing that for a brief period of time and
[SPEAKER_01]: they fall back down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they fall back down, we have an
optical system in here and we set it on
[SPEAKER_01]: different wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've told the machine what
wavelengths to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're running, we'll be running
potassium at 766 and calcium at 183 and
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus at 177.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's looking for those wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it measures the intensity of the
wavelength and the intensity of the
[SPEAKER_01]: wavelength according to the concentration
of the element.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're standardizing with the ICP,
we're actually measuring counts per
[SPEAKER_01]: second.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what CPS stands for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we want to do is we want to see
as the standards, as it takes up more and
[SPEAKER_01]: more standards, we want to see the numbers
increasing and then we know we have a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: linear fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have crucibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the crucibles, we get a weight on
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put some soil in the crucible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We let it sit in the oven at 105 degrees
centigrade for two hours and we take it
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We re-weigh it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we have an oven-dried weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we put it in our furnace.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our furnace goes up to 375 degrees
centigrade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after we put it in the furnace,
it has to be in there for a minimum of two
[SPEAKER_01]: hours, but we usually end up leaving it
longer because we just run out of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll take it out and get a
measurement of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't want to touch these until we
get a measurement of it because we could
[SPEAKER_01]: have grease or something on our hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we check to see there's a number on the
bottom of the crucible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put it on our scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I can't see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can measure how many grams is in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this would be 25.745.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll write that down in my notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we just end up using a,
so we have a weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, we know what the crucible weighs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a weight of the soil before it
goes into the furnace, a weight of the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil when it comes out of the furnace.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can calculate out what the
actual percent of organic matter is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and again, this is an extra test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's, it's just $7.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people like to know how much
organic matter is in their soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might, ideally you'd want to keep it
somewhere between four and 8% for most
[SPEAKER_01]: crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is number 23.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put 23 on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna put a little dot so I don't get
lost.
And
[SPEAKER_01]: so this would be 30.77,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, 30.773.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually have a, we can
calculate this out using a handheld
[SPEAKER_01]: calculator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we have a, we actually have a little
program in our computer where we just put
[SPEAKER_01]: these weights in and it just automatically
does it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also measure the soil pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pH is a very important variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the master variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil pH affects the availability of
all plant nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we end up doing is we mix a scoop
of soil with a scoop of, with five mils of
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We let it equilibrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: For about half an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we run it on our pH meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we get, we get the initial pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we get that, after all the pH's are
done, this tells us what the soil pH is at
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't necessarily give us an
indication of how much limestone to add.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after all the pH's are run,
we add a chemical buffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using the modified Malen buffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we add that to the soil and water
slurry that we've already created.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we reread the buffer pH's.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you know what the buffer pH is,
when you think about it, what is the
[SPEAKER_01]: buffering capacity of the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the soil's ability to resist change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what affects that?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much organic matter and how much play
is in the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use a modified Malen buffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that it's at a pH of 6.6.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see how far down it takes that 6.6.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it takes it down a lot, it's a
well-buffered soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't hardly take it down at all,
it's a poorly buffered soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a poorly buffered soil and
you're trying to change the pH,
[SPEAKER_01]: you would not need to add as much
limestone to it as if you had a
[SPEAKER_02]: well-buffered soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people want to know how much sand,
silt, and clay is in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they do that, it's an extra test.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a mechanical analysis or soil
textural analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we end up doing is we take some
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put it in a blender cup with some
sodium oxalate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we put it on our milkshake machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we let it mix for about 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we pour it into these Boyuka
cylinders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we fill it to a particular volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we need to take readings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this basically works like Stokes' Law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So heavy particles settle faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we would do is we use this little
stirring rod to stir it all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would stir it up very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will take our little stirring
rod out and we'll put in a hydrometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we take a reading at 40 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after we take the reading,
we'll take a temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what we'll do is we will take
another reading at two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through the process of subtraction,
we're able to tell you how much sand,
[SPEAKER_01]: silt, and clay is in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll take our little reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our reading now is about 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: And units, that would be grams per liter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the cylinder can come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set the timer for two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we didn't need a temperature
because it's all temperature based.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we put our little thermometer in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it just takes 10, 15 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see that it's about 20 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can calculate out how much
sand, silt, and clay is in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is an extra test, an extra charge
for an extra test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need a little bit more soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of sending in one cup,
you would send in two cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we would set our timer for two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll come back and we'll read another
reading in two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see how this is graduated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the bottom are the heavier
particles.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was sitting for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This hasn't been stirred.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that the particles are
starting to settle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how this works with the boyukus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the hydrometer, heavier particles
settle faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as they settle, they change the amount
of particulate matter that's in solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the reading that we're actually
taking with the hydrometer because the
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrometer measures in grams of soil per
liter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see these little measurements
are grams of soil per liter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once we know what your pH is and we
know what the different nutrient values
[SPEAKER_01]: are and we know who you are, we're able to
put this all into the computer and produce
[SPEAKER_01]: a soil test result, which we send to the
client.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like to send it via email.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ask that people please share with us
their email address.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you'll notice is we do test the four
major macro elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then these numbers don't necessarily
mean very much to a person.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think of them more as like an index,
but what you want to do is you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: note which column your results fall in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your goal is actually to get everything in
the optimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know what values would be below
optimum, what would be optimum,
[SPEAKER_01]: what would be above optimum, and in the
case of phosphorus, what would be
[SPEAKER_01]: excessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since the numbers aren't always clear
to what people mean, we have these little
[SPEAKER_01]: bar graphs and they put them into the
various column.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll tell you what the pH is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about what the buffer pH is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use that to make limestone
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also can do an estimated cation
exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's somewhere around 10, that means
you have a soil that has a fair amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: either clay and organic matter in it,
and it can hold on to nutrient cations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a cation, let me go back, an ion is a
charged particle.
[SPEAKER_01]: A cation is a positively charged particle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your soil has the same materials that
cause it to have a good buffering
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The clay and organic matter are also
responsible for holding on to the cations
[SPEAKER_01]: or the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we give people a rough estimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people ask for organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an extra test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, if you're somewhere between four
and eight percent, it's great for most
[SPEAKER_01]: crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a few organic growers that really
like to modify how much calcium,
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium, and potassium that they have
according to the base saturation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while this doesn't mean that much to
many people, some people feel that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're able to analyze a bunch of
trace elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there isn't any recommendations for
trace elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing we have in Connecticut is
because the soils are low in boron,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can make recommendations for alfalfa or
for commercial apple trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, what we've done is we took a
thousand soils and we came up with a
[SPEAKER_01]: typical range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're telling you to just use it as a
diagnostic tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's really accessible, that means
something's probably not quite right with
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow it was contaminated with that
particular trace element.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if your pH is where it's supposed to
be and the organic matter is where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to be, you should have good
enough amounts of trace elements in your
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we need you to tell us what
you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have over a hundred crops to choose
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll make limestone and fertilizer
recommendations according to the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll tell you what the target pH is
for the particular crop you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you need to add limestone,
how much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you're a commercial grower,
we would give you pounds of nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus, and potassium to add.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were a homeowner, we have a
tendency to make recommendations for
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer you could purchase,
like a 5-10-10 or a 24-4-3 or something
[SPEAKER_01]: along those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for most of the agronomic crops and
the commercial fruit and commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable crops, we just give you pounds
of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium per
[SPEAKER_01]: acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we give you some references.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every sample that we send out,
you'll get a link to our general
[SPEAKER_01]: interpretation sheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that basically tells you what we test
for and why.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we give you specific references.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were growing lawns, we'd give
you a lawn one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were a vegetable grower,
we'd give you a vegetable one.
[SPEAKER_01]: For hemp growers, there isn't anybody in
Connecticut that's doing research on
[SPEAKER_01]: fertility levels right now in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are in several other new areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: New England State.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've given you links to their hemp
information on their website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
