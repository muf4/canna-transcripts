[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for checking out another video
here on Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: This video, we're going to look at
measuring bones to estimate height,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can be applicable for a skeleton
that's found, or you can also try this
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself to see how well the math or
measurements come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at a single bone to
individual height.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by measuring a single bone,
the estimated height of the individual can
[SPEAKER_00]: be calculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to be able to properly
identify the bone to know the formula in
[SPEAKER_00]: the, or they should say the correct
formula to use, because you can't just
[SPEAKER_00]: pick any bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain key ones that a formula
has been developed so you can get a closer
[SPEAKER_00]: estimation of the height of the
individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to select a long bone to
measure, and I have a couple listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember from long bones,
the humerus, the radius, the ulna,
[SPEAKER_00]: the femur, the tibia, or the fibula would
be bones typically that are used in this
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at race and sex, or the gender
of the individual, knowing the race and
[SPEAKER_00]: sex of the individual of the bone will
help increase the accuracy of the
[SPEAKER_00]: calculation because there's different
formulas to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a crime scene with an unknown
individual, it's important to know that
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the identifying characteristics to
aid in the classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trained eye can spot some of these
details and other slideshows will go into
[SPEAKER_00]: detail on this to try to be able to
determine an unknown individual to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: classify them as to allow for a greater
formula to be applied with greater
[SPEAKER_00]: accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, you can measure yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can try this out for yourself here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to select one of the long bones
that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to measure the bone length in
centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you want to use the following
reference table on the following slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you choose one of those bones and
you take a measurement, here is kind of an
[SPEAKER_00]: initial kind of reference table to be able
to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how are you going to use this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you want to identify the bone you
measured, the humerus, the radius,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ulna, the femur, the tibia,
or the fibula.
[SPEAKER_00]: When define one of those bones measured,
use the measured length in centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The race or gender is known.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at a skeletal remains
and the gender are known, the most
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate estimation can be calculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you can just see some of the
equations, whether it's Caucasian,
[SPEAKER_00]: African-American, Asian, or unknown,
and whether it's male or female,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are different equations to apply
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will help provide you with an
estimation of the height of that
[SPEAKER_00]: individual based on only using one bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can calculate and measure your
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you calculate your height and compare
it to the actual height, you can see how
[SPEAKER_00]: close it comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember this is only an estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some bones might give you a closer or more
accurate answer, but they are all just to
[SPEAKER_00]: give an estimate, to give you a range or
an expected approximate height of the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want questions to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does your calculated height compare to
your actual height?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how may this be applied to a unknown
skeletal remains?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may want to use different bones and
find out which one provides you the more
[SPEAKER_00]: and less accurate results.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some bones provide closer to the
actual, but they're all just an
[SPEAKER_00]: estimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which bone for you provided the most
accurate results?
