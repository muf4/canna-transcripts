[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, as the title implies, we're going to
look at the four theories that unify
[SPEAKER_00]: biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So theory and certainty in relation to
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: The theory is a set of hypotheses that
have been tested many times and not
[SPEAKER_00]: redirected.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means it indicates a high degree of
certainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's no absolute truth in
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is open to more testing and
reinterpretation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acceptance of a theory is always
provisional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to the general public, when you use
the word theories, often used to mean what
[SPEAKER_00]: a scientist would call a hypothesis,
a lack of knowledge or a guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, to scientists, a theory
represents that of which they are most
[SPEAKER_00]: certain, explanations supported by a
wealth of evidence and experimental data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we use the word theory,
the general public has kind of a slight
[SPEAKER_00]: differently interpretation of it than a
scientist would.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to be careful when we look at
some of these theories, such as cell
[SPEAKER_00]: theory and so on and so forth,
that the general public typically defines
[SPEAKER_00]: a theory a little bit more like a
scientist would call a hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's got a lack of knowledge or
a guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the scientists though, there are most
certain explanations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 99% certainty, that's how it happens
because of the high degree of certainty
[SPEAKER_00]: related to all the tests that have been
done and no rejections to those tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another link to a YouTube video if
you want to observe what's the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between a scientific law and a theory
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So limitations of science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science is limited to organisms and
processes that can be observed and
[SPEAKER_00]: measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also practical limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientists can prove options and
understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientists cannot be relied upon to solve
all problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, what constitutes acceptable
risk cannot be answered by science.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get into that when you do sort of
experiments or evaluating certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's acceptable risk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, science really can't answer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting into the four theories,
the first one we're going to touch on here
[SPEAKER_00]: is gene theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: The information that determines what an
organism is like is encoded in its genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genes are located along DNA molecules,
deoxyribonucleic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire set of DNA instructions that
specifies a cell is termed its genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we pretty much accept this as
fact, this actually is explained through
[SPEAKER_00]: the gene theory here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, something that scientists are 99%
sure this is how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it's a theory, again,
not how the general public would define
[SPEAKER_00]: theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second theory is cell theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: All living organisms are composed of
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cells are the basic units of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: All cells come from other cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here, a cell is fighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going through and we see all cells in
this picture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially we say all cells come from
other cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We see cells dividing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brings about the question of like,
where did the first cell come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for right now, we're not going to
get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just looking at the general idea of
cell theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on, the theory of heredity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genes represent traits of an organism and
are inherited as discrete units.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chromosomal theory of inheritance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genes are physically located on
chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done planet squares or looked at
traits that are inherited, what's
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant, what's recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all supported by the theory of
heredity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows us to go through and create
these planet squares to determine the
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage or the predicted percentage of
offspring that will be one certain
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype versus another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the fourth theory that unifies
biology in this class, the theory of
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: All living organisms are related to one
another in the common tree of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diversity of the living world is a result
of natural selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here with the different bird
beaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Darwin came up with all these different
birds that eat different food items that
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't all competing.
[SPEAKER_00]: May have all stemmed from one common
ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They each developed certain degrees of
speciality.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't catch all four of those
theories, here they all are in one
[SPEAKER_00]: particular slide here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene theory, cell theory, theory of
heredity, and theory of evolution,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how they kind of all tie together and
unify biology in this class because this
[SPEAKER_00]: is a biology class.
Thank you.
