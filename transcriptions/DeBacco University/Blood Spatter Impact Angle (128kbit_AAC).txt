[SPEAKER_00]: So in this image we see various shapes and
numbers indicating the impact angle and
[SPEAKER_00]: the difference that can have on the shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm going to go over the blood
spatter impact angle, develop a little
[SPEAKER_00]: better understanding, and also how to
calculate that in some examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the impact angle is
important because the blood stain pattern
[SPEAKER_00]: study can also support one determining the
truthfulness of reports given by the
[SPEAKER_00]: observer, target, or suspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can help support a potential
explanation or can refute a potential
[SPEAKER_00]: explanation for what may have occurred at
a crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the angle of impact examples,
here's just some here, and we can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: the 90 degree kind of being that flat and
we're kind of increasing at 80,
[SPEAKER_00]: 70, 60, 50, all the way to like 10
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with stains that are impact angles
between 75 and 90 degrees, spines and
[SPEAKER_00]: satellite stains occur all around the
stain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And however, the angle of impact
decreases, the spines and satellites tend
[SPEAKER_00]: to become more prevalent on one side of
the stain compared to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're seeing here, and this is a
black and white image, but you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: this tends to be darker on the lower side.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a gravitational dent zone at the
lower edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That blood's kind of forming and
collecting a little bit more at that
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom area there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the angle of impact decreases below 40
degrees, the stain becomes much more
[SPEAKER_00]: elliptical and the nature of outflow of
the stain usually produces a single
[SPEAKER_00]: satellite stain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now calculating impact angle, you can kind
of see the basics of it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to identify the width and length,
it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calculators should be used to calculate
the arc sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in a circle, the width and the length,
a little more arbitrary, but here we could
[SPEAKER_00]: see definitely the length and the width
definitely are distinctly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's width divided by length, and this is
the formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: So note the direction of travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little hard when it's at 90 degrees
because there is no direction of travel,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it gets a little bit harder as we,
you know, maybe looking at an 80 or 70
[SPEAKER_00]: degree, but we start getting into these,
you know, 10, 20, 30, 40s and 50s degrees,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can definitely see getting that
elliptical shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows that the direction of travel,
so it's going to impact here and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to travel in this direction,
meaning wherever the tail is located,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is pointing like an arrow with the
direction of travel there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just kind of a way to kind of orient
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not looking at a broad-span
image, you're just looking at an image,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can tell which way the blood was
traveling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are the blood splatter impact
angle calculation steps, the process that
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's the arc sign, width
divided by length, but you first want to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure the length and width of the
splatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Divide the width of the splatter by its
length, so width over length, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: determine the arc sign of the number,
typically using a calculator with the arc
[SPEAKER_00]: sign function.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're doing is you're calculating,
again, that angle of impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, taking those same steps,
what impact angle did this blood droplet
[SPEAKER_00]: hit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this blood droplet referred to the one
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, because it's on a screen,
you might be able to tell, I've measured
[SPEAKER_00]: it for you, the width being 1.5
centimeters and the length being 3
[SPEAKER_00]: centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: How'd you go about calculating this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it'd be the width divided by the
length, and then you get that to be 0.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what you're going to do with that
number then is take the arc sign of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're going to get to be 30 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this impacted at a 30 degree angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're wondering where the arc
sign is on your calculator, sometimes it
[SPEAKER_00]: is referring to that second function that
you need to utilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be aware and learn your particular
calculator, and use this as an example to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you can get the same number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a sample data set, looking at the
distance fallen in centimeters versus
[SPEAKER_00]: volume of different droppers in
millimeters, and we can see the distance
[SPEAKER_00]: fallen 10, 25, 50, 100 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: An eyedropper produces 0.032 milliliters,
pipette 0.045, and medicine dropper 0.53.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the amount of the volume does impact
generally the size of the droplet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you're keeping at least that fairly
consistent, you can use it as a source of
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just something to keep in mind
when evaluating a crime scene where you
[SPEAKER_00]: may not know the volume initially of blood
that fell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a data set too, finding the angle
of impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I give you some short axis and long
axis, angle of impact on a sketch of this
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, so how it may look, to try to give
you some idea of what these numbers might
[SPEAKER_00]: equate to or what they might look like in
an image.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that information going through
now, and can you be able to go through
[SPEAKER_00]: some practice examples?
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave you one, but now I'm giving you a
little bit of a data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I give you five different blood
splatters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to find the angle of impact
following the blood droplet dimensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give you the length, the width.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to determine the angle of
impact measured in degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be a great time to pause the
video because my next slide is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide you with the answers to allow you
to check your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pause the video now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're calculating, and
hopefully on your little scratch piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: paper you came up with answers very
similar to these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're able to accurately be able to
calculate the angle of impact given the
[SPEAKER_00]: length and width of the blood spatter.
