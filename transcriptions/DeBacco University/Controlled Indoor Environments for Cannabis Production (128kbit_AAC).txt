[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to investigate
controlled indoor environments for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these indoor environments, I have some
pictures here of some like sterilized lab
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it may not necessarily be this
extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, this is advantageous to
reduce the chance for disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an advantage of being an indoor
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can control a lot of factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also pack plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with this, if these conditions are
unclean, disease can spread very rapidly
[SPEAKER_00]: through that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a controlled indoor environment
generally has no natural sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a sealed kind of growth
chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be computer controlled and
monitored, especially for larger
[SPEAKER_00]: operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to have good air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we think about this room,
we don't want to think about it completely
[SPEAKER_00]: sealed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There needs to be a good air circulation
that does occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, typically when we're adding air
circulation, humidity can become a factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be monitored, not getting too
low or too high, depending on what
[SPEAKER_00]: environment you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, they're good candidates for
adding supplemental carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're sealed, because there are
so many controls, this is why adding this
[SPEAKER_00]: extra steps is sometimes deemed to be
worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And documentation and cleanliness is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So indoor rooms are basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The room can basically cost as much as you
want to spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: The example here, you know, it can go very
cheap or it can go really expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, quality plant material,
the lights that you choose to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if there's no access to outdoor
sun, and the growing media should be the
[SPEAKER_00]: top priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what should you spend your money on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these are kind of the three main
things, the good quality plants to have
[SPEAKER_00]: good supplemental lights for them and a
good media.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you should be spending your
money first and then adding in some other
[SPEAKER_00]: things from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, a room should have that
cleanliness again as a priority and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent cleanliness throughout the
entire grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good air circulation, both for inside and
outside ventilation, reflective walls,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you're maximizing your lights that
hopefully are of high quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things aren't getting out of whack and
a carbon filter to eliminate odors,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if neighbors are a concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a small scale, a continuous harvest
should be a priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having one room that changes lights and
conditions with a planting will limit your
[SPEAKER_00]: total harvest once every four months or
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal is to always have rooms in
different stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're kind of getting into this
continual harvest of plant material,
[SPEAKER_00]: not going into like boom and bust.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting all flowers and then all veg
and then all clones and repeating that
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle, always having some in different
stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this small scale, multiple rooms or
tents allow you to have one dedicated to
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning and propagation, one vegetative
growth and one flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same concept is used for larger grow
facilities as they use large rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: dedicated for each of the three
distinctive properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think of it like in your house,
you want to have, you know, a baby's room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of your cloning and your
propagation room, a vegetative room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of where you're looking at
growing and expanding and then flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is considered like the money room
where the, you know, all the work is
[SPEAKER_00]: really done as that plant goes into
flower, produces those very useful
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lights determine the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a three foot by three foot area can
effectively be lit by a 400 watt high
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity discharge light, typically
abbreviated HID.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a five by five area requires,
though, a thousand watt HID light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the type of light or size that you're
using, this is a Gavita Pro 1000 DE.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a double ended bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could light a five by five area very
effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's other lighting options.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an example, regardless of the
number of lights can dictate the total
[SPEAKER_00]: square foot of growing space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you have an area to grow
in, if you can't effectively light it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you start to push the thousand watt to do
a seven by seven foot area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's just not going to be as
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five by five is the kind of the
recommended, maybe pushing it to six by
[SPEAKER_00]: six, but much more than that is not
recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Estimated yield will total expected grams
per watt after about two months of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minimal target is about .5 to one gram per
watt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example, if you were running a 600 watt
light bulb, it should produce about 300 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 600 grams of dried buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just gives you kind of an idea of
what that area should be using and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using it effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air circulation, as I mentioned,
is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having fans to move air within the grow
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, exchanging air from the
outside environment is also necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding a carbon filter, as we see here,
to reduce odors is highly recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, air is being drawn through the
carbon filter, taking out the odors,
[SPEAKER_00]: going through the ducting, cooling this
light that's producing a lot of heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then going and venting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a small grow tent operation,
but this same concept can be scaled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ceiling height is a definite
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a minimum of about five feet
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is considered the space needed for the
container of plant that's growing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: space for the light to ventilate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to cram it too short,
especially with the high discharge lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minimum is usually about five feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight or nine foot ceilings are ideal
wherever possible to give you just more
[SPEAKER_00]: air, more availability for cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walls of mirrors are not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a misconception,
especially in small rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll want to reflect the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, oh, I should just put a
mirror.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these mirrors kind of create hot
spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not the best choice since they
create hot spots and do not scatter the
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walls should be white or have some type of
mylar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of that mylar.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this reflective material does is will
increase the light's use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eliminate the amount of wasted light
that you're basically paying for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can help disperse that evenly
through the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure most of the plant is getting
light, even some of the lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if you hang mirrors,
the problem is you get that one kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: bright kind of hot spot there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can kind of increase the chance
of burning or damaging a portion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mylar is a great material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tools of the trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's also important to have good just
general tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pruning tools, of course, for the plants,
but also just general tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the setting up of the process
or maintenance of your room or a small
[SPEAKER_00]: operation, even large operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having that toolbox to properly find,
fix, and make adjustments is needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of an odd set of tools,
but having it also well organized and know
[SPEAKER_00]: where it is so you can easily find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test and monitor before installing the
plants to run all systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's any plants, ensure everything
is fully operational for at least two
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important to monitor heat of a
mid-max of the monitor here just to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes turning the lights on,
you think, oh, it all works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to save power.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go to put the plants in,
and you overheat the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding some water to make sure all
electric systems are safely installed.
[SPEAKER_00]: No circuits are also overloaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then make sure if a heater's coming on
or a cooling system's coming on,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're not overloading the circuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also light leaks if you're in small
operations so you're not getting that
[SPEAKER_00]: messing up a photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, temperature regulation is
another important thing to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't shock or kill your prize crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, location, location, location for
both small and large rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Location is everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small rooms to be considered proximity to
electrical outlets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also for air exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large operations need to consider the
flower room size and dynamics as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability to have both propagation and a
drying room to allow for that continual
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have outdoor locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a last part.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to consider the environmental
factors that may occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these, no matter what site
you're growing in, you should be very
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with your general location so
that you're able to maximize it but not
[SPEAKER_00]: overload it and end up throwing plants out
that you didn't plan for.
