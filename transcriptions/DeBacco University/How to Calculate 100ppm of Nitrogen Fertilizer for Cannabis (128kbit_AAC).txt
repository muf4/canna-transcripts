[SPEAKER_00]: This is a question I'm often asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you calculate 100 parts per million
of nitrogen fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well here at DeBacker University video
we're going to go through and we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to walk you through the process and
exactly how you go about calculating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grab your calculator and let's get into
the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, hopefully you got your calculator
and we're going to go through how to
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate 100 parts per million of
nitrogen fertilizer for your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why 100 parts per million?
[SPEAKER_00]: And PPM does stand for parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well typically the goal of nitrogen for
cannabis is 120 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for simplicity we're going to go how to
calculate 100 parts per million will be
[SPEAKER_00]: shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition I will show 120 parts per
million example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will allow you to see the multiple
examples so you'll be comfortable with the
[SPEAKER_00]: process and apply it to your own
particular growing situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know just how much to add without
over adding anything to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off we have to start with how do
you read a fertilizer label?
[SPEAKER_00]: So fertilizers will provide three numbers
which are percentages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The order is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes nitrogen, phosphorus, and
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since this example will calculate nitrogen
we simply are only going to be looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the first number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this one it's 4% nitrogen and this
one 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at this example here we're just
going to use a standard Jaxx water soluble
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer, 20% nitrogen, 10% phosphorus,
20% potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to again focus on that first
number here because we're calculating
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for actually fertilizing we can't
forget about those numbers but for the
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes of this calculation we're going
to focus on the 20% nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first question, how much fertilizer do
you add to one liter of water so you get a
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 part per million solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well let's go through the calculation
steps here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with that 20% nitrogen the
goal of 100 parts per million of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since the goal is 100 parts per million
how much fertilizer are we going through
[SPEAKER_00]: and adding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well our goal is that 100 parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So note that 100 parts per million is the
same as 100 milligrams per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing a little metric conversion
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our goal is to get to that 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much do we need to add?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we've got, we want 100 milligrams of
nitrogen per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 0.2 grams of nitrogen per one gram
of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 20% of one gram is 0.2 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have 0.2 grams of nitrogen per one
gram of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We simply go through, we multiply the top,
we divide by the bottom and as a result we
[SPEAKER_00]: get, we would add 500 milligrams per liter
which is the same as half a gram per
[SPEAKER_00]: liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go through and make some
modifications here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again our target here is 100 parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 20% nitrogen which is where this
number comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiply across the top, divide by the
bottom we get 500 milligrams per liter or
[SPEAKER_00]: simplified 0.5 grams per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're continuing on to that
continued question, if the ratios
[SPEAKER_00]: calculated previously was 0.5 grams per
liter, how many grams do I add for a 50
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon tank?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we have that ratio there of half a
gram per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a conversion from liters to gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One liter is the same as 0.24,
no I'm sorry, one liter is the same as
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.264 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to add to 50 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is how many grams do we
add?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, multiplying across the top,
dividing by the bottom, we would get 94.7
[SPEAKER_00]: grams per 50 gallon tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that might be more
applicable to a reservoir that a grower
[SPEAKER_00]: might be utilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go to question two.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much fertilizer would you add to one
liter of water to get 120 parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million of solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've upped the concentration
really to what's considered to be ideal
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again we're still starting with that
same 20% nitrogen, but now our goal is 120
[SPEAKER_00]: parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's set up basically the same
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're noticing, except we've changed
that 100 to now 120, we still have that
[SPEAKER_00]: 20% nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still 0.2 grams per gram of
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiply everything in the top,
divide it by everything multiplied in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get 600 milligrams per liter or in this
case 0.6 grams per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we continue that step a little bit
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the ratio calculated previously to add
was 0.6 grams per liter, how many grams
[SPEAKER_00]: would I add for one gallon of concentrate
tank to use in a proportion injector set
[SPEAKER_00]: at one to 200 ratio and 200 gallons of
irrigation water to be used?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're getting a little bit more
complicated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at using like a Dosatron
or a chemi injector or some way of
[SPEAKER_00]: injecting that fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since 200 gallons will be used,
the grower should add 454 grams into a one
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon concentrated source to make sure
everything dissolves and does not settle
[SPEAKER_00]: in this concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we get that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we get that 0.6 grams per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do our conversions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at 200 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we want to have 454 grams to be
dispersed over that 200 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could take that one gallon
concentrate, which is where the tube of
[SPEAKER_00]: our Dosatron would go into.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd mix in 454 grams, stir that up well,
run it for the duration of time to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: to our 200 gallons because a one to 200
ratio means one gallon of concentrate will
[SPEAKER_00]: be used for every 200 gallons of water
that goes through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great way you can ensure that
your plants on even a large scale are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the right ratio mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just, again, acts as a starting
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to go back through,
review this video a couple of times,
[SPEAKER_00]: do the math yourself with the information
and numbers provided here to make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: get the right numbers and then apply it to
your own situation so you can get your
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer for the gauge station dialed in
to the benefit of you as well as your plants.
