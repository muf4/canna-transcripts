[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another DeBaco University
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we'll be looking at selecting a male
plant for cannabis breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a question often asked, well,
how they go about selecting the male
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go through and breed two
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this video will provide you
with a little bit more information if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at going down this path.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, there are some challenges
with male plants because often growers are
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding for traits that are specific to
female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there needs to be a pollinator chosen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So selecting a quality pollinator that may
not exhibit the specific desired traits
[SPEAKER_00]: can be part of the challenge in the
breeding process.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are some key aspects to
look for and document as part of your
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully I'll be able to provide you
with some information regarding that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we want to consider the male
plant's morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morphology, keep in mind, is the basic
structure of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morphology is important since the goal is
to maintain a plant structure that can
[SPEAKER_00]: support itself while producing the
necessary compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a plant that produces great
compounds but is a very spindly,
[SPEAKER_00]: weak kind of structure, morphology,
that can be a very negative when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the breeding process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, male plant morphology is
definitely something to document and to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be considering the branching
and also the internode spacing for how
[SPEAKER_00]: dense of a plant that it might be
producing or contributing to the genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: of your breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, male plants can still produce
terpenes and while they may not end up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower in great concentrations,
if you kind of rub the stem, this can help
[SPEAKER_00]: indicate what terpene profile that plant
may produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be used to help the grower
determine what compounds the male plant
[SPEAKER_00]: may have for the initial phase of
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you're going through,
it's important to kind of like isolate one
[SPEAKER_00]: area, rub the stem to begin the lower part
and you'll get an idea of what that
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profile might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also plant vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aggressively growing plants can help
the breeding process and this helps the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a really nice, healthy,
robust looking, quick growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: highly vigorous plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another consideration when
looking at male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the pollen production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the number one reason why
we're considering male plants is their
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: For breeding purposes, while pollen is
needed, selecting males that are high
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen producers can help increase the
overall usage of the plants and limit the
[SPEAKER_00]: total number of male plants needed to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all male plants will produce pollen,
but if you're selecting some that produce
[SPEAKER_00]: higher rates of pollen, that can allow
growers to grow less male plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: have greater control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is another trait to kind of look
for that might be advantageous in the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, male plants producing female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put kind of a question mark there and it
is possible to kind of go through with a
[SPEAKER_00]: reversal epinephrine-induced feminization
in male plants of Candida sativa by
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene antagonists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interaction between Efron and two
ethylene antagonists, one silver nitrate
[SPEAKER_00]: and another cobalt chloride applied
exogenously, meaning to the exterior of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, to the male Candida sativa
plant was studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feminization effect was caused by two
sprays of 960 milligrams per liter of
[SPEAKER_00]: Efron could be overcome by 100 micrograms
of that silver nitrate or cobalt chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, neither of the antagonists could
suppress the feminization effect of 1920
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams per liter of Efron sprayed
twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is again a way that male plants
can produce female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be advantageous in your
breeding process to kind of go through and
[SPEAKER_00]: determine where that might be
advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look in the description,
there should be a link to this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: research paper that you're welcome to go
and investigate further if you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at some of the details of this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's also the requirement of
official lab testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So testing promising male plants via a
professional lab is important to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid and terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be a very targeted and
selective process, unless you have a very
[SPEAKER_00]: large budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be very selective on the
plants that you're choosing to potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: breed further and those off for
independent lab testing and independent
[SPEAKER_00]: plant testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can help you have a track record and
a great kind of documentation as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: what that plant produced for continuation
of breeding or maybe for elimination of
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding if it did not produce what you
were considered to be desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, typically many people
grow male plants, produce the pollen and
[SPEAKER_00]: then cull them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really want to let the male plants
complete their full growth cycle if
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not simply cut them down once they've
produced the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Letting the plants go through a natural
growth cycle can help provide some more
[SPEAKER_00]: information on how these genes may perform
at the end of the growth cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: which could be important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be important for female plant
production and harvest and just something
[SPEAKER_00]: else to consider instead of just chopping
down that flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it get powdery mildew late?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have other sorts of issues later
in the growing cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other important notes that as a breeder
and grower, if you're considering those
[SPEAKER_00]: genes to continue them on would be an
important piece of information can really
[SPEAKER_00]: help with your breeding process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And overall success.
