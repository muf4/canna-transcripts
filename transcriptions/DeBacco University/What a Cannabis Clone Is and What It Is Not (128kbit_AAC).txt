[SPEAKER_00]: So here in this Debaco University video,
we're going to go over what a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: clone is and also what it is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go through and answer the question,
what a cannabis clone is and what it is
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what is a clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: We hear them a lot and they get this like
mythical kind of like connotation with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A clone is simply a cutting from a stock
or mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an asexual vegetative propagated
plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why they're usually called
clones instead of that long kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: terminology there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's actually botanically what a
clone is.
[SPEAKER_00]: A clone is also genetically the same as
the original plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have unique individuals to go through
this cloning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what is a clone not?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when we're looking at a clone,
well, a clone is not a seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seedling here starts from a seed,
develops cotyledons, and it's kind of that
[SPEAKER_00]: new emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: A clone is that cutting asexual vegetative
propagation from an original plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones also will typically lack that
defined central taproot that you see with
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still can produce an aggressive set
of roots, but they will lack that central
[SPEAKER_00]: taproot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to realize that if
you're growing clones versus seedlings,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are not going to have that central
taproot with clones as you would if you
[SPEAKER_00]: were starting with a young seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why do growers like clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: They like them because it's guaranteed,
or at least consistent, genetics and known
[SPEAKER_00]: gender of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are two great aspects that are
very advantageous for growers to know so
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not wasting their time with
potentially a seedling that might be a
[SPEAKER_00]: male when they want a female, may not be a
cross, it might be new, and they wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what they're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why growers really like clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, for growers that like clones,
there's also reasons why growers don't
[SPEAKER_00]: like clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's a reason why a grower wouldn't
like a clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a challenge to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not starting with that small
seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're dealing with literally a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also typically increased cost per
plant versus seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can cause an increase in upfront
cost for growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of growers feel that the
advantages that I mentioned outweigh these
[SPEAKER_00]: potential downfalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is why there are those options to
plant clones or start with seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The option is up to you to choose what
fits best for your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
