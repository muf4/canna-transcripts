[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thrips are another major problem for
growers in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of some of the damage they
can leave behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of stippling to the leaves here
looks like someone took a little rough
[SPEAKER_00]: sandpaper and kind of scratched the leaf
surface is common thrip damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a pretty severe case pictured
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when identifying thrips, they're tiny
slender insects and they tend to jump
[SPEAKER_00]: since they're poor fliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how a couple here,
very small, very thin, kind of this
[SPEAKER_00]: tannish, kind of yellowish color
coloration almost see through to some
[SPEAKER_00]: extent and they don't travel very far
because they can't really fly that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can kind of jump around if disturbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They typically like to be found in places
that are low light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, where to look for them when I check
the undersides of the leaves because they
[SPEAKER_00]: do like that low light or within the
protection of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants with infestations will be evident
by the presence of tiny black specks,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are the feces of the actual thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're going through and inspecting
them, you do want to get close and look
[SPEAKER_00]: this person kind of shading from the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an onion field, but looking deep
down in that area where the light is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stippling, we can see a zoomed in
version of it here and this is kind of how
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks a little bit on the more macro
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how to prevent them and this is kind
of a zoomed in version and this is again
[SPEAKER_00]: how small they look in relation to the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I inspect incoming plants or
cuttings, I want to isolate thripped
[SPEAKER_00]: infected plants if they are identified
because they can eat easily kind of be
[SPEAKER_00]: cross-contaminating other plants you may
have nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: A weed-free barrier of at least 10 feet
around the greenhouse may help discourage
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having that 10-foot buffer kind of reduces
the chance that you're going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: high population very close to the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be very easy for them to come in
and infect your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to dispose of planted debris
in tightly sealed containers if you do
[SPEAKER_00]: identify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be just throwing them away
in open containers because they could
[SPEAKER_00]: breed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get picked up by fence or other
carriers to get into the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to control them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, due to resistance of many
insecticides, more growers are using
[SPEAKER_00]: biological controls for thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's commercially available natural
enemies including predatory mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: beetles, and insect-killing nematodes and
fungi that can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a wide variety of biological controls
are available for thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beneficial insect-killing nematodes
that are used against fungus gnat larvae
[SPEAKER_00]: may also be effective against thrip pupae
in growing media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of gives you that dual action
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could link to a YouTube video if you
want to see an action there and also a
[SPEAKER_00]: document here for more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: This again shows you the thrip getting
infected here with biological controls
[SPEAKER_00]: which are using at greater rates now that
there is a buildup to resistance to common
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticides.
Thank you.
