[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at
photoperiods related to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more than just hang lights over
your plants and lighting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be mindful of the duration of
light and darkness that you're giving your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this photoperiod may not apply to
auto-flowering varieties, all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties and cultivars, it is very
important to vastly affect the stage that
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So photoperiod first, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's the amount of continuous hours
of light the plant receives.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the hours of continuous darkness
is what regulates the plant, not the hours
[SPEAKER_00]: of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do think about the hours of light
that is important, but remember,
[SPEAKER_00]: plants can't perceive kind of the amount
of hours they've been exposed to with
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really only tell time by the
continuous hours of darkness they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, photoperiod controls flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a cannabis plant that receives zero to
six hours of darkness, or if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: think on the light side, 18 to 24 hours of
light will remain in the vegetative growth
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to keep in mind that
vegetative or flowering can happen at any
[SPEAKER_00]: stage of the plant development,
since it's dependent on photoperiod,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, for your cultivars other than the
auto-flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when cannabis receives an even 12
hours of continuous darkness and 12 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: of continuous light, that will induce
flower development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we want to keep it in the vegetative
state, then we will flip the lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: change them over, that is going to affect
what stage of growth that plant will be
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these photoperiods, you might hear
terms called long day or short day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is so much of the point city
example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auto-flowering plants will flower based
more on plant age rather than light
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something important here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our 24 hours, and we have that
critical period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we extend beyond that critical
period, it'll stay vegetative.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if we're less than that critical
period, just about 12 hours in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have that 12 hours of darkness,
13 hours of darkness, will induce
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what gets important here are
these special cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice the end result is the same
as here, where they're both in the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have the same conditions as here
that would normally stay vegetative,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have a 10 second cover,
not really affecting the total hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: the continuous darkness, so it mimics this
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it gets a little confusing is here,
is where we have this condition,
[SPEAKER_00]: which should have it flower, but we have a
10 second bright flash of light in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle, breaking that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, we don't have these
continuous hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these small portions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These small portions kind of replicate
this area here, resulting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just important to keep in mind
that those continuous hours of darkness
[SPEAKER_00]: are very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to break that cycle halfway
through, turn a bright light on to check
[SPEAKER_00]: something, and then turn that right back
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to potentially mess up the
photo period of what you may think you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: be exposing your plants to.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some other plants that kind of
follow something differently here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the poinsettia does match the example
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we see the flash of light will
affect whether that plant will flower or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we call this photo period flipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to go clearly from a
vegetative-promoting photo period directly
[SPEAKER_00]: to a flower-inducing photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to switch back and forth between
photo periods, because this results in a
[SPEAKER_00]: stress to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where a good timer that is
correctly programmed is imperative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to go right from that kind of
summer timer to that winter time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to kind of mimic a fall or
transition from one to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to flip right from one right to
the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will help you control the height of
that plant also, and reduce the stress on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in checking that proper photo period,
set up and check lighting before the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants come under that light or that
change in photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often timers are great, but they're only
as good as the operator.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kind of way that you could buy the
best timer in the world, just like you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: have the fastest car on the track,
but if you're not a good operator,
[SPEAKER_00]: can really have negative effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you're comfortable with
whatever timer you're using, and you also
[SPEAKER_00]: double-check to make sure it's working
like you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights out period or during the dark
period do not turn lights on, even for a
[SPEAKER_00]: short period of time to check on the
plants, as this will interrupt their
[SPEAKER_00]: natural continuous darkness perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, plants can only tell hours of
continuous darkness if you do have this
[SPEAKER_00]: camera flash that comes through that could
potentially mess up that perceived photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you must check the plants for
whatever reason, and you don't have that
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 hours, and you got to go through and
check them for some reason, use what's
[SPEAKER_00]: called plant-safe light, and that's a
green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a spectrum that the plants
ideally can't see or perceive,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll think that it's still the
hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that green light provides a grower
light to see and take care of plants if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's necessary, but it's not seen by
plants and helps maintain continual hours
[SPEAKER_00]: of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the comparison here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a grow facility I've visited.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green safe light, then the white
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure that white light
would be off, and you're only using the
[SPEAKER_00]: green light if you want your plants to
maintain the proper photo period so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can keep them in this stage of development
that best fits the growth cycle that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're working on.
So that's it for this video.
Thank you so much for watching.
