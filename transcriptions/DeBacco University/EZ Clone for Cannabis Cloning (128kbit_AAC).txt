[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to this tobacco university video
here I want to go over easy clone for the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cloning process Setting up the
physical system if you want to know how to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually take the clones I have other
videos on that but let's go over the setup
[SPEAKER_01]: of the easy clone system for cannabis
cloning All right, let's make sure all the
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanics will be working so when you take
your clones they'll be going into a good
[SPEAKER_01]: environment well first off we want to be
mindful that the reason why it shows the
[SPEAKER_01]: easy clone is it's the industry standard
there's many options but this is
[SPEAKER_01]: considered just to be one of the standards
and hopefully you'll have roots that will
[SPEAKER_01]: look like this or even better there's many
other designs that copy the easy clone a
[SPEAKER_01]: basic system which is again a sign it's
probably pretty effective it is very
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient and simple system and that's
kind of the reason why there's so many
[SPEAKER_01]: copies so you don't have to specifically
use this easy clone actual system that i'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going to show here a lot of the basics
will apply to other systems but i chose
[SPEAKER_01]: that one here just as a representative
sample and hopefully you find it helpful
[SPEAKER_01]: and increase the odds of success with your
own plants
[SPEAKER_01]: okay so here we're looking at the easy
clone system it's a very efficient
[SPEAKER_01]: aeroponic cloner what we're looking at
here at the very top is all the nice
[SPEAKER_01]: little foam discs here these will be
utilized to hold the plants so when we're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at taking our clones and
harvesting our clones if they were this
[SPEAKER_01]: pen for example we would simply go through
take a clone about that long and then
[SPEAKER_01]: insert it into the foam disc that then
allows this to be held and that will
[SPEAKER_01]: simply go into the area here we'll have
our little clones here now what occurs on
[SPEAKER_01]: the underside well on the underside this
is where all of the water pump is and all
[SPEAKER_01]: the water will be so on the inside here
we'll notice we have this water pump now
[SPEAKER_01]: this water pump simply takes in water and
then sprays it out of all of these little
[SPEAKER_01]: jets here what does that create well that
creates a very high humidity heavy mist
[SPEAKER_01]: environment right here why is that
important well if you look at kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: underside here you can see where i still
have the pen this is where our roots are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be initially formed want to keep
that area dark which we can see here and
[SPEAKER_01]: also high moisture to reduce the stress on
the plants so our plants will all be kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of here our clones with no roots initially
this will then create a very favorable
[SPEAKER_01]: environment for them to root and this
simple water pump just constantly runs
[SPEAKER_01]: around at 24 hours a day and that will
just kind of keep that area well misted so
[SPEAKER_01]: that offers a great advantage to be able
to kind of offer a favorable area for that
[SPEAKER_01]: rooting to occur you also notice on the
tank here there is a on the underside here
[SPEAKER_01]: there is an area to easily drain it that
is great to easily drain it when you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep in mind that if you are initially
filling this want to make sure that's
[SPEAKER_01]: closed and set and that no water is going
to drain out when you go through and fill
[SPEAKER_01]: it so you can see fairly easy simple
system this is the official easy clone
[SPEAKER_01]: name brand if you will there's many
different kind of copycats there are kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of different types of competitors out
there this is kind of where it all
[SPEAKER_01]: originated and this really offers a nice
very efficient system and let's see
[SPEAKER_01]: setting it up in a small grow tent
[SPEAKER_01]: so here we're looking at the 2x2 grow tent
that's going to house our 64 easy clone
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're noticing right here is a
demilux 315 watt CMH ceramic metal halide
[SPEAKER_01]: light that's going to provide the even
light source here for all of the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple systems off right now
we'll see those kind of implemented as
[SPEAKER_01]: they go through and turn them all get them
all working together but right now I've
[SPEAKER_01]: got the light testing that out and down
here is ultimately where the easy clones
[SPEAKER_01]: going to go keep in mind just because
they're clones air circulation is still
[SPEAKER_01]: important and here we're in an office so
we also want to make sure that we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon filter to reduce any potential
odors also going to set up the water
[SPEAKER_01]: monitoring system to our easy clone but
let's go ahead and just simply install the
[SPEAKER_01]: basic structure of the easy clone so kind
of getting it right off the main desk
[SPEAKER_01]: table there something going to go through
and it's a tight fit but it does just fit
[SPEAKER_01]: perfectly right there so you can see again
2x2 really maximizing the overall space
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have now I want to go through make
sure we're filling it full of water and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you that process
[SPEAKER_01]: so one quick note when we're setting this
up you want to make sure if you look very
[SPEAKER_01]: closely at the easy clone here you'll
notice that there's a series of numbers
[SPEAKER_01]: that work their way from one all the way
to the number eight on this side and then
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a series of letters as well H
through a that's up there and numbers
[SPEAKER_01]: replicate up there the numbers replicate
up there and the letters replicate coming
[SPEAKER_01]: down here and that's just important for
identification which you should be keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: track of anyway but knowing what clone
what strain what variety is in what area
[SPEAKER_01]: is important so again it's just helpful if
you start off by organizing it in such a
[SPEAKER_01]: way and orienting it so that the entry
point matches up with everything now if
[SPEAKER_01]: you look ahead here as I'm getting
everything together you'll notice I have
[SPEAKER_01]: the monitor in there and again this is
just with regular tap water so I've gone
[SPEAKER_01]: through and just taken right out of the
water faucet with our blue lab monitor
[SPEAKER_01]: here you can see reading 130 parts per
million 74 degrees Fahrenheit the pH of
[SPEAKER_01]: 7.0 to 7.1 I'm gonna go through and add
the necessarily the necessary nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: solution and let's see where this ends up
before we start modifying the pH at all
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's looking getting our nutrient
solution already for our clones I choose
[SPEAKER_01]: to use clone X clone solution and it
recommends about five to ten milliliters
[SPEAKER_01]: per liter so use that as a general
starting point always start on the low end
[SPEAKER_01]: and start adding what I kind of do is
start at the low end and I use my blue
[SPEAKER_01]: labs monitor here to be able to dial
everything in and make sure the solution
[SPEAKER_01]: that the plants will be exposed to is
within the tongs is that I want so again
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a great kind of initial solution
to start with works great with the easy
[SPEAKER_01]: clone and can kind of go right through and
just takes a little time to get everything
[SPEAKER_00]: all adjusted
[SPEAKER_01]: and when we're adding our nutrient
solution it's very important to keep in
[SPEAKER_01]: mind of where your monitors are so as an
extreme case here where I poured the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient solution happens to be exactly
where the monitors were so you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: right now growers might be a little bit of
in a panic with a high concentration of
[SPEAKER_01]: parts per million a very low pH but keep
in mind you want to let that pump run you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to give it a couple times before you
start making quick adjustments let it
[SPEAKER_01]: settle out add a little bit more add a
little bit more till you get it dialed in
[SPEAKER_00]: now again as another note you want to be
mindful that while everything looks like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's nice and sealed here and you lift
these out you might be getting some miss
[SPEAKER_01]: that sprays out so that's why it's
important always to start or have these on
[SPEAKER_01]: the hand to maintain a nice sealed
environment here because that pump is
[SPEAKER_01]: actively going and it's doing exactly what
we want it to do it's doing exactly what
[SPEAKER_01]: it wanted to do in the sense that is
spraying water some a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: violently than others but down as I look
down in there in that environment that's
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly what we want to see you want to
see that nice heavy heavy nest so there
[SPEAKER_01]: might be some dead spots here and there
but for the most part the high humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: that this does create is beneficial for
rooting just remember you want all of your
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients dialed in and you also want to
be mindful of maximizing the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: water and maximizing the amount of light
keeping air circulation keeping all the
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions you want consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: again we're watching our nutrients kind of
come up and get a little bit more dialed
[SPEAKER_01]: in there we're adding a couple a little
bit more being incremental not making sure
[SPEAKER_01]: we spike anything too much pump seems to
be working great just be mindful that you
[SPEAKER_01]: might want to be careful of some areas you
can spray a lot of water so you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure those are all nicely sealed up
before you get to your clones and that
[SPEAKER_01]: will just help maintain the water in the
environment and efficient use of that
[SPEAKER_00]: water because it's constantly
recirculating in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and as part of the easy clone we get
everything dialed in what am I shooting
[SPEAKER_01]: for well I think a parts milling around
720 730 temperature around 74 and pH
[SPEAKER_01]: around 6.2 these are good initial targets
to have there good way that will
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely produce some quality clones so
again once everything dialed in make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: things running well I got the fans running
the carbon filter set to go and I've got
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the area here all ready for clones
you
