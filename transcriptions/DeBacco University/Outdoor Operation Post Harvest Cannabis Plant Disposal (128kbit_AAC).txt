[SPEAKER_00]: So here on this DeBaco University video,
we're going to be considering post-harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant disposal as well as other
supporting plant materials required when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing outdoors and how we should
best approach kind of considering their
[SPEAKER_00]: disposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at a pretty large-scale outdoor
growing operation here and looks like a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of plants want to be considered of
disposal of the plant material as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the supporting plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example, such as the plastic used
for weed block, as well as considering the
[SPEAKER_00]: support cages, as well as any irrigation
or stakes they also have utilizing this
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, let's focus on disposal of
the plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Per the EPA, cannabis waste must be made
unusable and unrecognizable before
[SPEAKER_00]: disposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mixed with at least 50% non-canvas waste,
such as non-conceivable solids and stored
[SPEAKER_00]: in a secured waste receptacle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canvas waste can be disposed of in a
permanent landfill or through composting,
[SPEAKER_00]: incineration, or by means of in-vessel
digestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now landfills, most cannabis growers and
processors are shipping cannabis waste to
[SPEAKER_00]: landfills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why it's under federal
scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Composting as the goals provide optimum
conditions for microbial metabolism to
[SPEAKER_00]: help that kind of breaking down of the
process there of the plant material with
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's incineration, which must
occur at temperatures high enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy the toxic organic components in
the hazardous waste as well as reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: overall volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, with incineration, note that it
is not the same as burning leaves in your
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a much more controlled process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then speaking of controlled processes,
the in-vessel digestion is a more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient method of composting,
whereas the waste is confined within a
[SPEAKER_00]: building, container, or vesicle in order
to make a chemical-controlled airflow,
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, moisture, as well as odors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's just disposal of the actual
plant material, but there's also those
[SPEAKER_00]: plant-supporting materials we must
consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, we have to consider the
weed control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many times plastic or some form of row
covers utilized in
[SPEAKER_00]: this process can be even more challenging
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting out of the field or out of the
growing area, off to the side,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then removing it from here can also
present lots of challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biodegradable options do exist,
but often they can leave field trash and
[SPEAKER_00]: may still need to be handled in some way
or tilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, be considerate of what weed
control options you are utilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if utilizing drip irrigation,
this needs to be cleaned up at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many growers grow with one-time use
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only about four or six mil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be sufficient for a single
growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to reuse the material,
and this is referring to the drip tape,
[SPEAKER_00]: go with the 15 mil, as if you take care of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used for over seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if it's handled properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be better suited for smaller
growing operations, larger growing
[SPEAKER_00]: operations that might be utilizing plastic
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be wrapping up the irrigation
with the plastic and disposing of it each
[SPEAKER_00]: and every grow cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then lastly, disposal of the plant
supports.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that regardless of the
message or method used, plants often need
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of support.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of wind outside and a lot of other
exposures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some use trellis netting or stakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can be reused in some cases,
but it's more common with stakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will go through a soak of some kind
of sterilization before they're reused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using this kind of screen method.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be kind of a metal cattle
fencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers will utilize potentially
concrete supports, but keep in mind that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't just reuse it from time to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go through, have a way of cleaning it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if your plants didn't have any
disease, there's a chance it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: living on your stakes, could be living on
your trellis netting support, could be
[SPEAKER_00]: living on your neighboring containers,
your fencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure there's some form of sterilization
process so that you're avoiding any
[SPEAKER_00]: potential carryover from one growing
season to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because particularly you could notice
disease comes in really early on your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, even though you didn't see it the
year before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's living on the stakes,
living on the support equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting early plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do yourself a favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that little extra time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean up the things you're using from year
to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ideally your plants, as well as your
harvest, will thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
I'll see you next time.
