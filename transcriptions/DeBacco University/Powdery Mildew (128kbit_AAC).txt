[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to explain a little
bit about powdery mildew, which we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: evident right here on the leaves,
which is commonly seen, sadly,
[SPEAKER_00]: in many grow operations, because it can
spread quite easily and cause issues in
[SPEAKER_00]: many grow spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, powdery mildew, it's
probably one of the top concerns for
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, and it literally looks like white
powder, which is actually mycelium that
[SPEAKER_00]: can produce spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycelium, once seen with the naked eye,
is an indication there's much more
[SPEAKER_00]: environment control measures should be
taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that once you see it at this
level, if you consider it at the
[SPEAKER_00]: microscopic level, you're not just seeing
one small mycelium, you're seeing many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many mycelium on the surface, giving,
as the name implies, that powdered look to
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an indication you're probably a
little late to the game, but you should
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely be employing a control measure
at the first sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, where to look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is mainly found on the leaves,
so this is the area you should be focusing
[SPEAKER_00]: your scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to look at the most shaded leaves
that are either under one leaf or deeper
[SPEAKER_00]: into the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it can occur in areas near the buds,
but usually it first shows up at those
[SPEAKER_00]: shaded and sheltered areas that are away
from the light and also tend to have
[SPEAKER_00]: higher humidity levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It typically will start also not only on
these leaves, but on the underside of
[SPEAKER_00]: these leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here on the upper end,
but typically when we're scouting or
[SPEAKER_00]: searching to find those might seem at the
very early stages, you want to turn these
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves over and look at the undersides,
because they tend to be a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: protected and a little bit more moisture
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how to prevent perimeldo?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it thrives in conditions that are
humid to the point do form around the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to large temperature swings
can encourage the development.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, you can have a little bit
more pressure in the spring and the fall
[SPEAKER_00]: because of those temperature fluctuations
that naturally occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal to prevention is to maintain a
dry leaf surface and avoid large changes
[SPEAKER_00]: in temperature in your grow operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're an indoor, you have a little
bit more control over this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're outdoor or tunnel production,
keep in mind those fall and spring times
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're having those wide changes in
temperature, if you can moderate that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be a way to reduce and hopefully
prevent perimeldo formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to control it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, oxidate, as we see here,
the stabilized concentrated hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide is good for a quick spray option
to accomplish the same end goal with much
[SPEAKER_00]: less work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the advantage here is you're able to
kind of quickly clean the leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully then go through and implement
preventive measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good product because hydrogen
peroxide doesn't last very long,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the chance of having a long term
residue is basically vastly reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for a little bit more
stable control, milk can actually be used
[SPEAKER_00]: and that may sound a little weird or
strange, but 40% milk and 60% water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole milk is preferred due to the fat
spreading it more evenly across the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the pH change that occurs with
milk, with the coating of the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: surface, this is a great organic way to
try to control perimeldo, especially once
[SPEAKER_00]: it's seen on the early stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while this may not kill the actual
mycelium, it definitely slows down the
[SPEAKER_00]: progression and ideally will prevent the
initial formation of perimeldo if you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're in a high pressure situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for your attention.
Thank you.
