[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBacco University video,
I'm going to go over a very common method
[SPEAKER_00]: of curing cannabis, and that's curing
cannabis in sealed containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you can pick up some
important information here to make your
[SPEAKER_00]: curing process as successful as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at sealed container
curing of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see an image of that right here,
one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a community control pack,
cannabis buds in a sealed container here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, you want to limit the size
of the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since containers used will be of
limiting size, the buds should be removed
[SPEAKER_00]: from the branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may have been done during the
trimming stage, but this may need some
[SPEAKER_00]: extra attention to detail to ensure only
the chosen material enters the curing
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I say limited size of containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't mean you want to have like a
small little micro size container,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you have these giant large
containers, it might sound really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just control the environment in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically, using smaller size
containers trimming down the buds to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure only the valuable materials placed
in them is something that is advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that chosen container, what container
are actually going to put the buds in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, wide mouth mason jars, as pictured
here, typically are the preferred option.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 32-inch jar on average holds about an
ounce of dried bud, plus or minus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to leave about 25% air space
within the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to go through and pack the
full container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to leave a little bit of space
there to allow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some movement of those buds and they don't
want to get impacted and do any physical
[SPEAKER_00]: damage to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, bigger isn't necessarily better.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the container gets large, larger the
ability to ensure a controlled drying
[SPEAKER_00]: process and curing process becomes more
challenging, simply because the large
[SPEAKER_00]: volume of the mold has an increased odds
of developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these wide mouth mason jars,
very commonly used, used to great extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, some people say that they don't
want to use these simply because they live
[SPEAKER_00]: in area prone to earthquakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I typically advise them, you might want to
reconsider where you're living because
[SPEAKER_00]: these are glass jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably, other than the photo here,
probably don't want to be storing them in
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular kind of orientation simply
because you don't want to have the risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: damage to them or breaking of that glass
mason jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here we want to shake it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the idea comes here for to avoid the
buds from becoming a mass and occasional
[SPEAKER_00]: shaking may be advised to keep each bud
separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the reason why we wanted to
leave that 25% gap there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to avoid overshaking to limit the
amount of physical damage that occurs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but kind of just a light general shaking
or even just turning of the container can
[SPEAKER_00]: be enough just to ensure that each bud is
consistently independent of one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then where do you want to put these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most containers should use, do not block
light completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure to place your containers in a
dark, cool environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see here a dark room,
kind of like that wine cellar like concept
[SPEAKER_00]: there where it can be a little bit light
and kind of reduce light as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity and duration goes, but overall
want to keep them in a relatively dark,
[SPEAKER_00]: low light environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a process that you don't want
to set and forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: The curing process should be routinely
checked on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be very important in the early
stages to the buds containing the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we can see three different
containers, relatively similar
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures, relatively same humidities,
but definitely one is a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something we do want to be
checking on because we want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't want to lose or jeopardize the
end harvest at this very late stage in the
[SPEAKER_00]: full process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this concept of burping containers,
you may have heard this, burping the
[SPEAKER_00]: containers involves opening the container
a few times a day for the first week to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow moisture to escape and oxygen to
replenish.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this process, check for foul odor
as this can be a sign that mold is
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So burping is just simply open the
container and then closing it back up
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows that gas exchange to occur,
any moisture to kind of leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows oxygen to replenish within the
container, typically done daily,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least during the first week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expected humidity progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be a decrease overall using
a hydrometer should be used to know the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact humidity level of the curing
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The target humidity range is usually
around 60 to 65%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you can get a little too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you can get on the higher side
and we could see each one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: individual containers has its own kind of
gauge there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we saw previously, just because you
have it in one doesn't mean every
[SPEAKER_00]: container is going to be exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to know if one's running a little
high, one's running a little low because
[SPEAKER_00]: it really can prevent long range problems
or ultimately loss of that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: container or crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after that first week, routine checks
can go down to twice daily, from twice
[SPEAKER_00]: daily, I should say, to basically every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So checking them morning and night and
just checking them once a day after that
[SPEAKER_00]: first week.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you get to that week, two and three,
you can decrease that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drying process seems to be going good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drying process is progressing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even go down to an every other day
routine check, every other two,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, skip a day, skip two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's going well there as you get
later in that process because you will
[SPEAKER_00]: have less and less variability and closer
to that ideal range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you know when you've reached the
end of curing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some growers use three weeks until
final cure, others up to eight weeks until
[SPEAKER_00]: the final cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of gauge how the buds are looking,
gauge the humidity levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you've reached the end of
your curing process, keep in mind you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not quite done yet, you're almost there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step after curing is storing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other videos here in Tobacco
University that you're welcome to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: look at to ensure you have a quality
storing process to keep all that hard work
[SPEAKER_00]: that you did to keep it as long as
possible in peak condition.
