[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is going to be a brief overview
of some lab techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, plate streaking to get
isolate colonies of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole point of having good lab
techniques is being able to develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat of that process again and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these proper techniques are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why are they important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, developing good habits will help
reduce the variability in results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that data noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see here where the general trend is
somewhere right around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the goal of being well-versed in
techniques is that you're eliminating some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the peaks and the valleys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're reducing the data noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the only true way to really improve
your technique is through practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep working with the equipment,
keep at it, and you will hopefully get
[SPEAKER_00]: better and improve your technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some common techniques, just to mention a
couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be separate videos on these,
but weighing objects, which might sound
[SPEAKER_00]: easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pipetting procedure is a good one to focus
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Filtering, sterile technique, and use of a
centrifuge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just see here in this general lab here
the amount of pipettes that are around.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be a centrifuge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these techniques are utilized with
different protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be familiar with the equipment that you
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So know what type of equipment you have
access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, both of these people are
pipetting, one using an automatic one and
[SPEAKER_00]: one using more of a manual one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to understand the options that
each has.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these require smaller tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: These require these large glass tubes
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just generally performing the
same basic action, but no what options
[SPEAKER_00]: that you may have and what may be best fit
for the protocol that you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: meet and do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, lastly, just as you're going through
and practicing, wearing gloves is
[SPEAKER_00]: typically something that's done in the
lab, no matter what you're moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your dexterity can be affected by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're practicing again,
use gloves and develop that feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually you'll be able to work just
as well with gloves if you're not used to
[SPEAKER_00]: wearing them as you would be and have the
same feel as if you weren't wearing them.
Thank you.
