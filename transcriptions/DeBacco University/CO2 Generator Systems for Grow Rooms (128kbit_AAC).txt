[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm going to take a brief overview
of CO2 generator systems for grow rooms or
[SPEAKER_00]: grow facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now CO2 generator systems are typically
looking at burning something here to
[SPEAKER_00]: generate CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not using compressed bottled CO2,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CO2 generator systems, they burn
natural gas or propane to produce carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide, and these are less expensive than
emitter systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So emitter systems will simply have
compressed CO2 in a bottle and deliver
[SPEAKER_00]: that to a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're using propane or natural gas
through a burner system and using that to
[SPEAKER_00]: then, through the burning process,
releasing CO2 as a byproduct into the
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how are these produce heat?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these burner systems, it's important to
make note that they are going to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: heat, so that could be an issue depending
on the lighting and other setups you may
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, water is an additional
byproduct to the combustion that's
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring to generate the targeted CO2
gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can cause high humidity in an
area, increased heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for certain operations, these might be
ideal if you have a cold environment that
[SPEAKER_00]: is typically low humidity, but if you
already have a warm environment that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to regulate and maintain
humidity levels, this could cause some
[SPEAKER_00]: issues there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just important to consider this
as an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great for some operations,
not great for others.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are using this generator system,
keep in mind your controller should not
[SPEAKER_00]: have fuzzy logic enabled to allow for
efficient dosage of these CO2 in heat
[SPEAKER_00]: systems for your growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and have a great day.
