[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at the
genetic engineering summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after the summary, we're going to
go through a couple stages in
[SPEAKER_00]: experimentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the general summary,
we're looking at genetically engineered
[SPEAKER_00]: animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also apply to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same basic process of changing or
modifying different genes in an organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start off with gene cloning,
I'm going to go through just the
[SPEAKER_00]: highlights here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So step one is a small circular deening.
[SPEAKER_00]: A molecule called plasmids, you may
remember that from our previous videos,
[SPEAKER_00]: are removed from bacteria cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plasmids serve as vectors,
which are molecules that carry genes of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gene of interest could be just
something we want to multiply,
[SPEAKER_00]: something that we're interested in
developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go through a lacZ gene would be an
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Antibiotic resistance genes also could be
added here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see restriction sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember from our restriction
enzymes, those are areas where there might
[SPEAKER_00]: be specific cut sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, those plasmids are those small
circular regions of DNA found in
[SPEAKER_00]: prokaryotic cells, in this case,
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA containing the gene of interest is
also taken from its original cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this cell here contains our gene of
interest, whatever gene you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: multiply.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking it out of this nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be a eukaryotic cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are going to put it into our
plasmid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So step three is restriction enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recognize this is a specific restriction
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a short sequence about four to
eight bases long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a specific region here,
restriction site, where that DNA is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember from our restriction
enzyme video, here we're going to cut the
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cause these things called
sticky ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: These sticky ends are bases that don't
have pairs and they want to pair up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to join.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of the sticky ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part four, it breaks apart the DNA,
these restriction enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaving overhanging regions called sticky
ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: These restrictions enzymes cut open the
circular plasmids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same enzyme cuts our gene of
interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important that the same enzyme is
used because we want these to rejoin to
[SPEAKER_00]: one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want them to cut the very same
specific sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on from step four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're left right here, step four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And step five, these sticky ends of the
restriction fragments attach to one
[SPEAKER_00]: another via base pairing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, A binds with T, G binds with C.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same thing that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gene of interest gets included into
some of the plasmids forming recombinant
[SPEAKER_00]: plasmids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to hear some of the
plasmids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to think that every single plasmid
takes in that particular gene of interest,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's not always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they form weak hydrogen bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gene of interest gets included.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other plasmids close right back up,
remaining unchanged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see an example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red indicates the gene of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plasmids basically get separated with
the restriction enzymes and get rejoined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did not take in the gene of
interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA ligase links our bonds together,
makes bonds permanent by attaching
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleotides to each other with those
phosphodiester bonds you may remember from
[SPEAKER_00]: that methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These phosphodiester bonds are joining
that ligation and they're forming now a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger plasmid, but still that circular
form of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plasmids are mixed with bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them take up the plasmids in the
process called transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should also sound familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hopefully see a lot of these terms
are coming back into this one big summary
[SPEAKER_00]: of genetic engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our unchanged plasmids here don't have
the little red, and our recombinant
[SPEAKER_00]: plasmids do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those, both unchanged and
recombinant, are taken up by our bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on from step seven to step eight,
the plasmids here with our laxy gene turn
[SPEAKER_00]: the bacteria blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the recombinant plasmids, the inserted
gene interrupts the laxy gene in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria remain their original color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacteria which do not take up any plasmids
also remain uncolored.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is used for a way to identify what
bacteria may have taken up our gene of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Antibiotics can also be added because the
plasmid contains genes of antibiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So other than just inserting our gene of
interest or whatever that may be,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be produced insulin or something,
we also introduce antibiotic resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What these allow us to do, when we're
genetic engineering something,
[SPEAKER_00]: is to select for those cells that took up
our gene of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those cells that took up our gene of
interest also get this antibiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance gene so that when we add
antibiotics, you could see those that did
[SPEAKER_00]: not take up our plasmid end up dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only those cells that have the antibiotic
resistance genes will end up surviving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those bacteria that have those genes for
antibiotic resistance also have our gene
[SPEAKER_00]: of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an important step here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step 10, the bacteria are then sorted by
color, isolating the bacteria which took
[SPEAKER_00]: up the plasmid containing the gene of
interest, and the uncolored bacteria are
[SPEAKER_00]: then allowed to be produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we simply have selected, as we can see
here, these bacteria, these blue bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, are something against.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not taken up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could use antibiotic or we can use
coloration sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part here is we want to generate
genetic engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to isolate the bacteria that have
our gene of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a process which we go through
and do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's four stages to the genetic
engineering experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a large view here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see here, this is generally all the
steps that I just went through in more
[SPEAKER_00]: detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have these stages when we're
looking at an experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stage one, some terms we might become
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleaving DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large number of fragments are produced and
separated by electrophoresis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a separate video on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the quick summary, what we're
doing, we're taking our long DNA and we
[SPEAKER_00]: are putting it into wells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're separating out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're chopping that DNA up into different
sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're separating it based on size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Larger fragments stay up closer to where
we originally put the whole slug of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the smaller fragments are able to
travel further.
[SPEAKER_00]: More on that when we do electrophoresis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because it's pulled by current.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the term electro comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stage two, producing a recombinant DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these vectors, important term here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Site of cleavage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleavage here is referring to separating
our DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are done by restriction enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vectors are plasmids or something as
viruses that carry foreign DNA into the
[SPEAKER_00]: host cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vector DNA is cut with the same enzyme
as the source DNA, thus allowing the two
[SPEAKER_00]: to join.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only do we need to cut the host
plasmid to form the sticky ends,
[SPEAKER_00]: we also need to cut the DNA to take out
the gene of interest we want to add in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want them both cut with the same
restriction enzyme so that they bind
[SPEAKER_00]: together and form this nice need to bond
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Host cells are usually bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the bacteria cell reproduces,
it forms a clone containing the fragment
[SPEAKER_00]: bearing vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, all we're doing is using bacteria
because they multiply so rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli can multiply every 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're basically multiplying that gene
of interest very quickly, turning a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: plasmids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cloning those, turning a lot of the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a screening process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the primary screen of clone library
eliminates clones without the vectors,
[SPEAKER_00]: those that don't have the gene of
interest, or clones with vectors that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't contain DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: In certain cases, here we have the example
of our DNA fragment in our vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is to become a vector that we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all cells would take up this
particular plasmid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll just take up the vector without
the gene of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we have a screening
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be antibiotic resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could also be based on color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bacteria columns are going on agar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, it's a nice t-street.
[SPEAKER_00]: That screening, again, as I mentioned,
antibiotic resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ampocellin is a very common antibiotic
that's used.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take our cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put them on those that have an
ampicillin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that have our gene of interest also
have that antibiotic gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're able to break down ampicillin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: While type or general cells are not able
to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ensure the cells that are left are
the ones that have our gene of interest
[SPEAKER_00]: because they also have antibiotic
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a selecting agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beta-collactidase is another way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is looking at color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the white colonies have the plasmids
with the foreign insert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue colonies have plasmids without the
insert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would be selecting for the white
colonies here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what's happening here is
we're interrupting the normal sequence of
[SPEAKER_00]: the genes, causing the cell to lose its
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: That white color are the cells that we
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, again, shows our sticky ends forming
from our plasmid that's cut with a
[SPEAKER_00]: restriction enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ampicillin resistance gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can see the genome with the,
in this case, the plasmids with the gene
[SPEAKER_00]: of interest located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a screening process because,
as you can see here, not every bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: cell took up the vector with the gene that
we wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a quick summary if you want to
watch this other YouTube video.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the way we're taking our
plasmid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're cutting it open with our restriction
enzymes and we're putting in our gene of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also need a way to select for or
ensure the bacteria that we have have our
[SPEAKER_00]: gene of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do that with antibiotic resistance
or also coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this is a just hopefully
overview for genetic engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
