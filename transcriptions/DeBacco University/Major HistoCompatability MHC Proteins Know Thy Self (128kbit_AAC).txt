[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at the MHC
proteins, which stands for major
[SPEAKER_00]: histocompatibility proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the note here of know thyself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how cells are able to interact and
recognize one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: These MHC proteins are very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So class one and a class two, and we'll
look at those in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with that know thyself here,
quote, know the enemy and know yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a hundred battles, you will never be
defeated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is part of the immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be able to identify the enemy,
but it also needs to know itself and be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to recognize what self cells are so
it doesn't attack those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first step to identifying the
enemy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's our first kind of process here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have to recognize our own cells
and every cell in the body carries surface
[SPEAKER_00]: markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those surface markers are called MHC
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, they're called major
histocompatibility proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: These MHC proteins are different for each
individual, and they act as cells markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So class one has basically one binding
site here to the cell, and class two has
[SPEAKER_00]: two binding sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see an example here of our class
twos and class ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are class twos, these are class
ones, these are ones, and these are twos.
[SPEAKER_00]: This indicates even further which ones
came from a maternal line, which ones came
[SPEAKER_00]: from a maternal line and a paternal line,
from mom and from dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So identify the enemies, number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have antigen-presenting cells,
sometimes abbreviated APC cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ingest foreign particles or partially
digest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case here, we have macrophage
encapsulated bacterium in the vacuole.
[SPEAKER_00]: They then combine pieces of foreign
particles with MHC proteins and move them
[SPEAKER_00]: to the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our lysosomes here, our digestive
enzymes, are fusing with this bacterium,
[SPEAKER_00]: causing it to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's our antigen, and here's
our MHC class two receptors, move the
[SPEAKER_00]: digested bacterium and presenting it on
the cell surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: T-cell receptors can only interact with
cells that have a combination of MHC and
[SPEAKER_00]: antigen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why it's important to have
these MHC proteins incorporated in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's helping identify as a cell without
destroying the entire cell here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This image here, I'm going to spend a
little time on, is the antigen processing
[SPEAKER_00]: and presenting steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we notice we have a pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's being ingested here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this pathogen or extracellular
antigen, as indicated here, two different
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways, are being taken in by the cell,
being engulfed by the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fagacetitis would be the proper term to
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this antigen-presenting cell,
which is a dendritic cell, is placed into
[SPEAKER_00]: a vesicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see both of these different pathways
of antigen being acquired from either
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the dendritic cell here or acquired
from outside the environment here,
[SPEAKER_00]: being placed into a vacuole.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ingested pathogens are digested by
the digestive enzymes in the lysosome and
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting with the antigens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this lysosome is releasing these
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These enzymes are breaking this bacterium
down, maintaining the antigen from the
[SPEAKER_00]: digested pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: These antigens bind with MHC proteins that
enter the vesicle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we notice it's occurring with the
bacterium and also in the case here where
[SPEAKER_00]: we have our extracellular antigen being
going through that same process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important that these are able to bind
with the MHC class II protein so that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can be presented on the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we progress further, our MHC proteins
are now carrying the antigens and are
[SPEAKER_00]: released from the vesicle and travel to
the outer surface of the cell membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they never reach the outer surface,
our T cells wouldn't be able to bind with
[SPEAKER_00]: them, meaning if our MHC proteins bound
with the antigens and were stayed inside
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell, there'd be no point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our T cells can only bind with receptors
on the cell surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important this dendritic cell
is now presenting antigens on the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: surface so that it's able to activate T
cells that bind with the MHC proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is helping the immune system be able
to recognize these foreign invaders or
[SPEAKER_00]: these antigens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We require these antigen processing cells,
APC cells, to go through this process to
[SPEAKER_00]: then display these on the surface with the
appropriate MHC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our T cells can recognize this itself
and recognize this as a foreign antigen
[SPEAKER_00]: and then initiate a potential immune
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully going through and
understanding this very complex process
[SPEAKER_00]: was a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to pause the video and take a look
at this image here so you can better
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the antigen processing and
presenting process.
Thank you.
