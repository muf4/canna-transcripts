[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're gonna take a brief
overview of the phylum Oleska.
[SPEAKER_00]: Found kind of a cool image here of a
greater blue-ringed octopus and a snail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both are classified under this particular
phylum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start off with, these mollusks are
coelomates, and they have a soft body,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's comprised of three regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a head-foot region, visceral mass
containing the body's organs, and then a
[SPEAKER_00]: mantle which envelops the visceral mass
and is associated with gills that capture
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen from water and release carbon
dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of the way that they breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at that head-foot region,
we have the foot region of looking,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, of the snail, and the head
region located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visceral mass is that main area containing
all the organs, and that mantle here
[SPEAKER_00]: indicated in blue here is that area that's
allowing that gas exchange between oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: and carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's three main groups of mollusks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the gastropods, which are your
snails and slugs, which you may be most
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with, bivalves with clams,
oysters, and scallops, and cephalopods are
[SPEAKER_00]: your octopus and your squid.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all classified under the same
phylum.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit more of a detailed look here,
as we can see over here, all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: The snail, the gastropods, we have a
little bit of a description there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clams, you can see a nice kind of
partially open here bivalve, contains two
[SPEAKER_00]: shells, that's where we've got two valves,
which is where the bivalve comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cephalopods, which is the octopus,
they can release ink when they're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to escape from predators, and they have
ways to propel themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, very smart animals here,
a large brain considering their relative
[SPEAKER_00]: body size.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever seen videos on them,
they can figure quite a bit of complex
[SPEAKER_00]: problems and puzzles out, which is quite
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at the addition here,
our snail, for example, has this radula,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a feeding structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is a very unique structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a rasping tongue-like organ that has
rows of pointed backward curving teeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at it here, and it's like,
oh, there's kind of a little bit of rough
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at it very specifically and
close up in our microscope, we see how
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive this can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: This backward kind of rows of curved teeth
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how the animal feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have true teeth, but this
backward facing will allow food to come in
[SPEAKER_00]: easier, and it creates a much harder time
for it to exit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would get caught here, and it allows it
to be worked into the organism for
[SPEAKER_00]: digestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic body plan, you can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's not so much going on here
that we need to kind of worry about and
[SPEAKER_00]: know, at least for purposes of this class.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may be doing dissections of animals
within this phylum, so this might be a
[SPEAKER_00]: good area to kind of come back and refer
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have kind of a general idea of how
this body system compares to some others
[SPEAKER_00]: that I talk about in other videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly here are coelomates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an outer surface of the mantle
that secretes a protective shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not every coelomate, let's go back for one
moment, several species here can no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: have shells, but many do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's not a distinguishing feature,
but those that do have shells in the outer
[SPEAKER_00]: surface, it acts as protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's multiple layers, and it's
comprised of protein, calcium,
[SPEAKER_00]: and pearl.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why if you've ever opened,
in this case, a clam, it's kind of got
[SPEAKER_00]: that nice shiny pearl-like look.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because it is composed of some
pearl substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many species in various forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an illustration that shows the
anatomy of an aquatic gastropod.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is just one example of this
very diverse phylum.
