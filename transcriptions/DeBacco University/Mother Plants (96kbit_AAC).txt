[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, a term commonly used in the cannabis
industry is the concept of mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are also considered stock
plants and they're plants that are unique
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that are going to be the source
of many offspring, in the sense of many
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they're called the mother
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mother room is where these plants will
be kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mother plants is one that will be used
to generate many clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be referred to as a stock plant
since it is the main source of propagation
[SPEAKER_00]: material for future plants and typically
around two months old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're kind of that one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have all these identical
offspring that are going to come from that
[SPEAKER_00]: one stock plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to ensure that the mother plant's
in good health and has desired traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's critical for the success of any grow
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any female plant that can become a mother
plant and the original plant material can
[SPEAKER_00]: be a seed or a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure they're in peak
of health.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure they're getting all
the nutrients that they need, not overfed,
[SPEAKER_00]: not underfed, in the proper moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conditions so they're not going under any
biotic or abiotic stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maximize a cannabinoid production.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, a six month old plant will
produce more cannabinoids than a one month
[SPEAKER_00]: old plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A one month old clone can actually behave
more like a four month old plant and can
[SPEAKER_00]: be encouraged to flower in a shorter
interval by photoperiod adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can also help maximize production
if we're looking especially at a large
[SPEAKER_00]: scale operation where days and weeks
difference can make a large end product
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reducing that time as much as possible
through the use of mother plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: clones is one way to accomplish that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To maintain that mother plant,
the goal is to keep the mother plant in a
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative phase with just enough nitrogen
to allow for easy cloning process and then
[SPEAKER_00]: by a short duration to root.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you overfeed them with nitrogen,
the time to root will be greatly increased
[SPEAKER_00]: and that can offset schedules and also
make a difficult following process with a
[SPEAKER_00]: weak root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why you want to keep them healthy
and properly fed but not overly fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
