[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to go over how to use a
[SPEAKER_00]: pressurized mixing tank or easy flow for
cannabis plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever wonder how to use a pressurized
mixing tank or easy flow for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant production?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the video for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what one typical setup looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go into some of the details
here in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we have to understand the
system parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically this system easily attaches to a
faucet hose, which is why it became so
[SPEAKER_00]: popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy to hook up with essentially
part that allows for some water to divert
[SPEAKER_00]: into the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here that contains a fertilizer
can slowly be fed into the main line hose
[SPEAKER_00]: or irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically it's pumping water in
pressurizing the tank, forcing a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit out that has fertilizer and irrigation
water and putting it into the irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a very simple concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it operate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the basic method is that the mixing
tank injector operates at the discharge
[SPEAKER_00]: line on a pressurized differential
concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have some pressure, difference
pressure coming in pressure coming out and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the device in the middle there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the water is diverted from the main
flow mixed with the fertilizer and then
[SPEAKER_00]: injected or drawn back into the main
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of comes in, gets through,
mixed around and then put back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: A measured amount of fertilizer required
for one injection is placed into the
[SPEAKER_00]: cylinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flow back into the main line is often
controlled by a metering device installed
[SPEAKER_00]: at the inlet side of the injector.
[SPEAKER_00]: To operate again, as described previously,
there must be pressure difference in the
[SPEAKER_00]: injector line and inlet and outlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is that pressure differential
that is needed and the valve there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are some fittings that should
take care of this, but keep in mind in low
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure systems, this may not be the best
option for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a visualization of the process,
which is why some growers like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The connection here of the injector the
concentration, I should say, of the
[SPEAKER_00]: injector fertilizer does change as the
chemical becomes diluted as water enters
[SPEAKER_00]: the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think of it this way, showing for a
long period of time, this is a very large
[SPEAKER_00]: tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have kind of a solid amount of
fertilizer over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using up more and more and more of
that fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting more and more diluted to the
point we essentially just have pure water,
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation water left in the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point we'd go through and we'd
change that and then we'd go through and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'd refill it and repeat the same
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, so the key points to remember are
that only install in an on-off pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: applications where the system's only under
pressure when in use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not want to have this tank under
constant pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have a valve before it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the valve turns off, the pressure
is alleviated from the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this will prevent the chance of
fertilizer backfeeding as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have that kind of additional device
in line, do not use if there's over 50 PSI
[SPEAKER_00]: or pounds per square inch as this can
damage the system or some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: components of the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not let this tank freeze because water
expands when it freezes and it can damage
[SPEAKER_00]: the tank or the upper portion,
the internal workings as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the feed rate, you'll notice some of
these do have a listed feed rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are different flow rates,
which can change the ratio of irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: water to fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this is a range, since it is not
exact, it does provide grower an
[SPEAKER_00]: approximation of the dilution rates for
different fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see, we have a slow, and then we have
a number one setting here, and it tells
[SPEAKER_00]: you the capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 0.75 or three quarter gallon
tank in gallons to empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the slow setting, it'll take about 750
gallons to empty the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a faster setting, it'll only take
375.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers can make this adjustment for
the speed or rate that they want to add
[SPEAKER_00]: their fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the general fertilizer application
rate example here, just to provide you
[SPEAKER_00]: with some numbers so you can see how well
you can apply it to your own situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be some adjustments made,
but this can provide just a good starting
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers will often add food dye to the
fertilizer to be able to see the dilution
[SPEAKER_00]: and consumption visually and allow them to
further and quickly dial in their rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, if we're applying 3.5 pounds of
triple 20 to 1,000 square feet per week,
[SPEAKER_00]: once you have fruit set, apply five pounds
per 1,000 feet of 16,326 with calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing tomatoes,
peppers, you should spray them weekly with
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium chelate at a rate of two ounces
per 1,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the manufacturers recommend
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could also search them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you purchase one, look at the
important documentation because the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that you purchased might have slightly
different recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we just see here, some are for very
small, some for very large operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have different tank sizes,
so keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they all work on the same really
basic concept where if you have your
[SPEAKER_00]: faucet, you add that little fitting there,
you attach your hose to the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fitting, this little apparatus attaches to
the tank, and that tank then can go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and inject the fertilizer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping in mind, it's not under constant
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let it freeze, and this can be an
effective way to very easily add
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer to your irrigation water,
and your plants will thank you.
