[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this DeBaco University
follow-up video from one of our previous
[SPEAKER_00]: student series with Kiara looking at
rabbit damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to look at rabbit
damage on a canvas plant with a follow-up
[SPEAKER_00]: on how to mitigate and help get these
plants to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's the return of the rabbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while they're nice and small,
they were doing quite a large bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was fencing around the entire
area, but it simply had too many points of
[SPEAKER_00]: entry for the small rabbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like any good grower, you're going to
analyze the situation and develop a method
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to mitigate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Analyzing the situation, it seemed like
there was a concentrated area for this
[SPEAKER_00]: damage, so individual plant protective
measures were put in place to help salvage
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these plants were of the fairly large
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, the rabbits hadn't come in
earlier, where they can simply just mow
[SPEAKER_00]: down the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, while rabbits are small,
they could still damage fully grown
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of had reminiscent themes of
the Monty Python rabbit there,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's able to take down and destroy
something much, much larger than the
[SPEAKER_00]: rabbit itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the overall method is very quick,
which is kind of key.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a simple method, which doesn't take
much time, which makes it more likely to
[SPEAKER_00]: be implemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply putting an arbor guard tree trunk
protector, as we can see right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a zip tie around the stem at ground
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why they're so cost effective,
they only cost about $2.50 to under $2 per
[SPEAKER_00]: guard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it simply depends on how many you buy
as far as the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the plants that had damage,
a simple stake here, we can see right on
[SPEAKER_00]: the side, and a rope support was added.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch out for drip lines, though under the
weed barrier when you're punching that
[SPEAKER_00]: stake in the ground, always find a way to
kind of find one or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you repair that if you do,
or do move it away at the beginning before
[SPEAKER_00]: you do go through and punch the stake in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be put around other plants,
too, to prevent the issue from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a preventative as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these are Keira's going to
demonstrate just kind of how they look on
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are meant also to keep line trimmers
from damaging tree trunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are pretty rigid, they are pretty
solid, and they can be utilized from year
[SPEAKER_00]: to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just recommend you sterilize them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go out to the field there and
let's hear from Keira about our follow up
[SPEAKER_00]: on our rabbit damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a continuation of our bunny damage
video.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few weeks ago, a bunny came through and
gnawed on the bottom of our beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant here and resulted in it
actually falling down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our response to this was to put a
collar on the bottom of our plant to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that the bunnies can't come through
and start gnawing on this again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that perfect bunny level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another thing that we did was add
supports since this was, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: trampled to the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much we needed extra support and to
be able to keep itself upright.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we didn't add these stakes,
then it would still be on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: When this plant fell, this branch
specifically endured a lot of damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's pretty much almost completely
severed from the plant other than the
[SPEAKER_01]: connection right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so while most people would see this
branch almost completely severed and just
[SPEAKER_01]: decide to remove it, sometimes it'll
choose to survive with this super,
[SPEAKER_01]: super cropping method.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of these branches here,
as you can see, will actually start facing
[SPEAKER_01]: up towards the sun so that all of the buds
can receive proper light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called tropism and it causes the
plants to look up to the sky towards the
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though this plant received extreme
amounts of damage and this branch almost
[SPEAKER_01]: completely fell off, you can still see
that it is thriving, even though it has
[SPEAKER_01]: been damaged very heavily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
