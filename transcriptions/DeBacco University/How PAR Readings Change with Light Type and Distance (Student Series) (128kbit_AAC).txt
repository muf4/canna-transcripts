[SPEAKER_01]: In this DeBaco University Student Series
video, we're going to be looking at how
[SPEAKER_01]: PAR readings change with the light type
and the distance those plants are away
[SPEAKER_01]: from those lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be comparing an LED light
with a fluorescent light in this video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I get into the video, I just want
to show you the two different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: lights that are going to be looked at in
this video.
[SPEAKER_01]: The LED light is a Fluent Spider X Plus,
660 watt, and the fluorescent light is an
[SPEAKER_01]: Agra Bright Designer.
[SPEAKER_01]: T5, 324 watt fluorescent light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to have some background, hope you
enjoy the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now we're taking a PAR reading
with all of our lights on to measure how
[SPEAKER_00]: different the readings are at different
distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now at the absolute top,
we're at a good 650.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at six inches down, we lower down to
just 370.
[SPEAKER_00]: At another six inches down, we're
measuring 216.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go down another six inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at just 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, another six inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've made it down to 64, double digits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's very important to know
how far away you're going to want your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to be from your light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're comparing our 600 watt LED
lights to our fluorescent lights that we
[SPEAKER_00]: were just showcasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see they're pretty much at the
same height level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just to compare how drastically
different the PAR rating is at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: level, just from a different light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right up at the top here, we're reading
at 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go six inches down, we lower down to
a 780.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 inches down, we're reading 630.
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 inches down, we're reading 558.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 24 inches down, we're reading 390.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see this is very different and
much more intense than the fluorescent
[SPEAKER_00]: lights that we're currently using on our
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
Thanks.
