[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a brief overview of
inorganic hydroponic production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always some debate between
organics and inorganics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part is, whether you're using
organics or inorganics, fertilizing plants
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to do a lot better than those that
are unfertilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially with hydroponic production,
we're pretty much growing in a water-based
[SPEAKER_00]: solution, choosing what nutrients to add
are very important, and you can use a
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of both inorganic and
inorganic for a quality end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, though, to inorganics,
the advantage is especially towards newer
[SPEAKER_00]: growers who should start with this type of
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start with organics where that
adds a lot of complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: New growers should start with inorganics
because it tends to be a more stable
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're able to look at and measure and see
results that are a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organics can cause some changes and can
have some variable plant availability
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're brand new to growing,
it's not unwise to start with inorganics
[SPEAKER_00]: because it can offer you that consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll be able to learn the plants and
then slowly incorporate more organics if
[SPEAKER_00]: you would like to into your operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often inorganic fertilizers are more
quickly plant available, so it's something
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep in mind if you are switching back
and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, this can allow growers to
correct potential issues fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you're an inorganic grower,
you're having an issue, you may want to
[SPEAKER_00]: grab an inorganic fertilizer to help speed
that or correct that problem that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: noticing quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: For both new and experienced growers,
consistency can offer many benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the advantages to
inorganic fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to develop a feeding plant can
help increase the odds of success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can run plants on just the right
amount of nutrients, keep them dialed in,
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping that kind of everything focused
and very consistent can result in very
[SPEAKER_00]: high yields.
Thank you.
