[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're gonna look at pregnancy,
childbirth, and development of individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can gain a greater appreciation for
what occurred early on in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with the placenta.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is before you were born,
you had this connection to your mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: This connection is the placenta through
the umbilical cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: The placenta itself is a flattened
circular organ in the uterus of pregnant
[SPEAKER_00]: mammals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides nourishment and maintains the
fetus through the connection of the
[SPEAKER_00]: umbilical cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's occurring in this connection is
between the fetus and the mother is carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide, urea, and hormones that are
generated in the fetus from being
[SPEAKER_00]: exchanged with the mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, the fetus is acquiring from
the mother nutrients, oxygen, antibodies,
[SPEAKER_00]: vitamins, and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a lot of arteries and veins here
because a lot of nutrient exchanges that
[SPEAKER_00]: are occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why it's gaining oxygen from
the mother and giving carbon dioxide is
[SPEAKER_00]: the fetus itself cannot directly exchange
the acids with the outside world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to have this connection to the
mother to be able to allow that process to
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, physiological changes for expecting
mothers and their effects during pregnancy
[SPEAKER_00]: will be variable based on the individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's some key areas that will
notice a change because of the unborn
[SPEAKER_00]: child as it grows and develops.
[SPEAKER_00]: One in particular is the GI tract,
gastrointestinal tract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some mothers will experience morning
sickness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is due to elevated levels of estrogen
and progesterone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urinary system, eye urine production will
increase to handle the additional fetal
[SPEAKER_00]: waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the respiratory system, the expected
mother could have shortness of breath or
[SPEAKER_00]: difficulty breathing simply because her
diaphragm may not be able to fully expand
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the growing fetus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cardiovascular system, the mother will
have the blood gun increase of about 25 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 40% because of now it needs to also
exchange the blood of the unborn child.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may also be headaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be muscle pain, leg pain,
lower back pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these can occur and will vary
between one mother and another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, stages of childbirth, estrogen
reaches peak during the last weeks of
[SPEAKER_00]: pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the onset of labor until the
cervix is fully dilated about,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is about 10 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initial contractions are about 15 to 30
minutes apart and last for about 10 to 30
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds in duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strong contractions are defined as ones
that occur every two to three minutes and
[SPEAKER_00]: last for about one minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, this entire childbirth
process is a positive feedback loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after the child is delivered,
the placenta is delivered within about 30
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes of birth and termed the
afterbirth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that placenta we were talking about
looks like this, very red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's highly vascular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those allow those nutrients to be
exchanged between the mother and at the
[SPEAKER_00]: point of being in the uterus, the unborn
baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, upon birth, there's an APICAR score
that's given.
[SPEAKER_00]: About one to five minutes after birth,
an infant's physical status is assessed on
[SPEAKER_00]: these five characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's given a quick zero to two score.
[SPEAKER_00]: An APICAR score of about eight to 10
indicates a healthy baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower scores reveal problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, the pulse is taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulse rate, if it's greater than 100,
that's given a two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's between 60 but less than 100,
it's given a one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's less than 60, that'd be a zero and
that'd be area for concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could also be looking at, for example,
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there active movement of the recently
born babies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there some flexation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there none?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here, it's a quick way to
be able to assess the baby's physical
[SPEAKER_00]: status.
[SPEAKER_00]: Postnatal development, babies are
typically double in birth weight within a
[SPEAKER_00]: few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different body parts grow at different
rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an allometric growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's important is that early on,
nerve cells are producing an average of
[SPEAKER_00]: greater than 250,000 per minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, at six months, neuron production
ceases permanently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why it's important you don't
damage your nervous system because beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: six months, the nerve cells that you have,
you'll have for the rest of your life and
[SPEAKER_00]: your body does not make more or repair
connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we have our stages of child
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our infant and babies defined
as zero to two years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Toddlers or preschoolers are two to five
years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are where meltdowns are very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just instinctively seems like they
always say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to learn how to accept no from
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be a very challenging time.
[SPEAKER_00]: School-aged children, eight to six to 12,
generally are gaining more independence,
[SPEAKER_00]: process learning and making good choices,
and hopefully developing or setting the
[SPEAKER_00]: stage for good life skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adolescents or teenagers are 13 to 18
years old and this is the time that begins
[SPEAKER_00]: defining oneself and realistically
contemplating the future and talents
[SPEAKER_00]: become refined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though many students kind of fall
into that 13 to 18, adolescents or
[SPEAKER_00]: teenager years, it seems like they may
have behaviors of toddler or preschoolers
[SPEAKER_00]: at times, even though they should be
focused on kind of realistically planning
[SPEAKER_00]: for the future and hopefully refining
their talents or skills so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: continue those beyond 18 years old and
being able to develop an interest and
[SPEAKER_00]: carry that on for the rest of your life
and maintaining that interest.
Thank you.
