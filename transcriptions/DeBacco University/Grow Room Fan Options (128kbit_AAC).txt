[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to look at grow room
fan options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think fan is just a fan,
but you can see here there's very
[SPEAKER_00]: difference on their location and also what
their intended purpose is for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, horizontal airflow fans is
the ones we see in the image here and
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These help, these are circulation fans
that help stir the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concept was introduced by UConn's own
floriculture specialist, Dr. J,
[SPEAKER_00]: back in 1967.
[SPEAKER_00]: I linked the article right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea here is to kind of keep air
moving here above the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these fans aren't directed directly on
the plants, but they're helped here to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep that air moving, especially in
tunneled structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now oscillating fans we might be familiar
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're highly recommended for grow rooms
and tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be placed far enough away from
plants to make leaves move, but not induce
[SPEAKER_00]: water stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them blowing directly on
the plants causing potential for leaf burn
[SPEAKER_00]: or just inducing water stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that nice gentle blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why oscillating fans, there's two
different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some can oscillate internally.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may oscillate with in the cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be one we're more familiar
with, but this actually motor will kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: rotate and oscillate as it goes through
and stirs the air that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps prevent any one plant from
getting all the directed wind and
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading that out over the grow area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now fan efficiency, fans are able to pull
air about four times more efficiently than
[SPEAKER_00]: push air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why exhaust fans are directed
to force air out of a structure rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than rotate it to blow air into a site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these fans are located inside the walls
and they're going to blow air out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what's important because they're
a lot more efficient at pulling air than
[SPEAKER_00]: about four times greater than pushing air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we may think that, oh, it might be good
to blow air in.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're about more efficient at
pulling that air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the little Gary Larson cartoon
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So exhaust fans used to help keep the air
exchanging in a grow area rated in CFM,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that stands for cubic feet per minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to calculate the volume of the
room, the length, the width, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: height that gives you the volume,
and then match the fan that can replace
[SPEAKER_00]: the air volume in under five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers may even shoot for one
minute, but under five minutes is the key
[SPEAKER_00]: part here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a fan in your room,
you want to make sure you want that is
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing out, even though you may think you
want that blowing your face to help you
[SPEAKER_00]: make you feel cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at pulling air,
again, exhausting, pulling that air from
[SPEAKER_00]: the room and exhausting it out would be
your best option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there could be different grow area
sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why there's different fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why you want to match that to your
volume of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also squirrel cage blowers,
and they get their name for the cage look
[SPEAKER_00]: to the fan blades that they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can move the air well, but are often
noisy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of looks like a hamster wheel in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one option that might be a fit
for your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just want you to know what those are,
and they can be noisy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that's a concern, take that into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have inline fans that I have here
in the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are used within ventilation tubing
to help pull air through the ducting to be
[SPEAKER_00]: exhausted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the carbon filter, we have our ducting,
and we have our inline fan here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is used to kind of send that,
ideally that hot air after being cleaned
[SPEAKER_00]: through the carbon filter, taking out some
of the odor, and then exhausted out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have the variable speed controller,
which is good for regulating how much air
[SPEAKER_00]: is being exhausted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since this is a relatively small grow
tent, a four foot by two foot,
[SPEAKER_00]: a four inch fan should be sufficient for
this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're talking a very large area,
ceiling fans can be an option,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're good for super large matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are called big ass fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the name of the actual company,
and they actually go through, and these
[SPEAKER_00]: large gigantic fans can help circulate air
in very large facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They help keep that air moving efficiently
with minimum use of fan motors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
