[SPEAKER_00]: On this Tobacco University video,
we're going to look at oral drops derived
[SPEAKER_00]: from cannabis and provide you a little bit
more of a detailed description so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: have an understanding of just what these
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into oral drops
derived from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, I want to thank CT Pharma
because they provide publicly available
[SPEAKER_00]: local reports and labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: The descriptions, options and uses here
are intended to provide an understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: of some end products of the cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: CT Pharma does a great job of making that
publicly available and as a model for many
[SPEAKER_00]: other companies and manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, description of what oral
drops are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, typically an example here,
a marijuana extract blended together in a
[SPEAKER_00]: solution with natural flavors and medium
chain triglycerides and CTs for a
[SPEAKER_00]: convenient, discreet, easy to use drop
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the oral drop options that exist,
there are two different oral drop options.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's standard drops of marijuana
extract, those natural flavors and those
[SPEAKER_00]: MCTs I talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also nano drops, which are a
marijuana extract blended in water soluble
[SPEAKER_00]: based for precision microdosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you have the regular and then
the nano for that precise microdosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These drops are available in high CBD
varieties as well, high THC varieties and
[SPEAKER_00]: a mix of both THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, be mindful of what you're
seeking and make sure you're getting that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oral sprays are also available as these
are lower dose flavored solutions that can
[SPEAKER_00]: be sprayed directly into the mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the use of oral drops, well,
they're highly convenient way to ingest
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana or cannabis in general,
as there's no smell, no need for any
[SPEAKER_00]: combustion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also come in many different dosage
forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drops can also be combined with food
or drink to allow for an easier
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: These drops are highly effective for
patients with respiratory problems as
[SPEAKER_00]: there is no inhalation requirement to
consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some of the benefits that they
offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with those benefits, anything that
you're looking at purchasing, always go
[SPEAKER_00]: back to make sure you can get a
certificate of analysis report.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to make sure that it's dated and the
lot numbers match up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people will be looking of course at
the terpenes and cannabinoids and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: all in good, but we want to also be
looking at the microbial analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals, microtoxin, pesticides and
make sure our products are passing those.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times the numbers provided here
will hopefully appear also on the label
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's great that they have this label
and make it really easy to read,
[SPEAKER_00]: but make sure you're also able to access
the original documents we see here to
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage that there's a current test,
the lot numbers match up, just so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: be a well informed consumer more so than
just looking at the label, making sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: know where to access that information that
supports the numbers presented there on
[SPEAKER_00]: the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
