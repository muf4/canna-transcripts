[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here in this video on DeBacker
University, we'll be looking at fire
[SPEAKER_00]: investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go over some of the basics and also
some of the goals of investigating what
[SPEAKER_00]: may have happened when we have a fire that
occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, those investigation basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, workflow should start from minimally
damaged areas and progress to ones with
[SPEAKER_00]: greater damage, those kind of fringe areas
and working closer to where the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: source may have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Investigators should use typical forms of
forensics documentation and collect
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence as they're going through and
doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this documentation can include notes
and photographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The evidence collected typically is
evidence of potential accelerant samples,
[SPEAKER_00]: fire items and other evidence that may not
be directly fire related but can help in
[SPEAKER_00]: that investigation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of this investigation is to try
to determine the point of origin,
[SPEAKER_00]: the heat source or sources, and also a
possible reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that point of origin, well,
that's basically, well, where did the fire
[SPEAKER_00]: originate from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Burn patterns are used to help answer this
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the area of the most damage
is commonly where the fire started because
[SPEAKER_00]: it simply had the longest burn time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point of origin can be used to help
determine the cause of the fire as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why this is one of the goals of
the investigation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have char patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So char patterns are created by very hot
fires that burn very quickly that move
[SPEAKER_00]: fast along a path.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can result in sharp lines between
burned and not burned material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Door char patterns can help determine what
side of the door the fire was on and floor
[SPEAKER_00]: char patterns can help determine if an
accelerant was used in its path.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the example here of a char pattern
from about one liter of gasoline on the
[SPEAKER_00]: area that that can create just to give a
general idea of what a char pattern would
[SPEAKER_00]: look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something called V patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the fire burns up, as we see it
actively burning on this image here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the building, it burns in a
vertical V shaped pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a fire that starts at an outlet against
a wall leaves a char pattern that points
[SPEAKER_00]: to the point of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, narrow V shaped patterns typically
indicate a very hot fire that could have
[SPEAKER_00]: an accelerant added to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A wide V shaped pattern suggests a slow
burning fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's kind of a U shape to it,
it indicates a pool of origin,
[SPEAKER_00]: not really a point of origin, such as a
puddle of gasoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of get that area where it's kind
of progressing, not that distinctive V
[SPEAKER_00]: shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're looking at an area of
post-burning, we could notice a potential
[SPEAKER_00]: for heat shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what a heat shadow is, is it simply
occurs when an object shields another,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can help determine the point of
origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: A room, a desk could shield a wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see an evidence of where a person
may have been laying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see evidence of their legs,
torso, their arm, and their head region
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of the heat shadow that is laying
left behind due to the result of the body
[SPEAKER_00]: physically blocking some of that fire from
progressing to certain areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at glass, if there's glass in a
particular situation, this is great for
[SPEAKER_00]: the fire investigation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we see here, a light bulb, this can
help indicate the fire's direction as they
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to melt towards the heat source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case of the light bulb up here
where the heat source is, basically it
[SPEAKER_00]: came from this region over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This indicates the bulb was pulled,
showing that the heat came from the right
[SPEAKER_00]: of this image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Windows can also be another source as they
can help determine how the fire burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's presence of like a really dark,
sooty layer on the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could indicate a slow smoldering
fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And clear glass with an abnormal pattern
of cracking could imply a very hot fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be possibly due to the use or
inclusion of an accelerant in that
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have something called the chimney
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got regular fireplace in a
chimney, it operates along those same
[SPEAKER_00]: terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that chimney effect is simply when the
fire ignites at a point and superheated
[SPEAKER_00]: gases raise upward in a giant fireball.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a typical chimney, you're mostly going
to have the smoke and the gases kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: extend out the flute of the chimney.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're having a fireball effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fireball will continue to burn straight
up, burn a hole in the ceiling potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's present in the area, which can
help determine again the origin of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fire, which can be directly underneath
this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of potentially allows for a
pinpoint of an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that chimney effect can occur more than
just so and only just a chimney,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it can help determine again that
important point of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, if you're looking at an
actively burning fire, if someone was able
[SPEAKER_00]: to capture a picture of the fire,
the color that you see can help provide
[SPEAKER_00]: some clues.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the smoke color.
[SPEAKER_00]: This indicates potentially the type of
material burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking to make a signal fire,
you want to use like typically your
[SPEAKER_00]: conifers that are fresh and green.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll produce a lot of smoke to that
fire, where most of the time you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking if you're burning in a wood stove,
you want to let your wood cure for a
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, your oaks and your maples.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will create a much cleaner,
almost no smoke coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the flame color indicates the fire
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here with the little candle flame,
the blue zone being about 800 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we could see upwards at the top
here, much hotter potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,200 degrees Celsius to 1,400 degrees
Celsius in this upper portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, looking at that kind of
coloration that we see of the flame color,
[SPEAKER_00]: can help provide a general indication of
how hot that fire is burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also have fire patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this image shows an ignitable liquid
pour pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a pour pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the image here,
like a spilled container of milk,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's simply indicating that area where
that accelerant may be, where that
[SPEAKER_00]: ignitable liquid may be located.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can kind of see this evidence of
our hard edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see our unburned areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking this apart, you know,
really looking at potentially not just,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, is it burned in an unburned area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the medium burn, the heavy
burn, the hard edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can tell an investigator a lot about
what occurred as the fire was going on.
