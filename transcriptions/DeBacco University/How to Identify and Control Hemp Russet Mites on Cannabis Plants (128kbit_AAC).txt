[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this DeBaco University video,
we're going to go over hemp russet mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying them, and how you go about
controlling them if you do identify them
[SPEAKER_00]: on your cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over how to identify
and control hemp russet mites on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, that general description,
and they are small, just to give you an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we'll go back here to the actual
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very, very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is evidence of one right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see them right here on the leaf
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is the only reported host for
hemp russet mites, and attempts to
[SPEAKER_00]: establish it on related plants in the
cannabis basically general family,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabisia, such as hops and hackberry,
have so far been unsuccessful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of very specific to hemp
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this may not be studied very well,
there are indications that it is related
[SPEAKER_00]: to the tomato russet mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking for something to
compare to, that might be a source of at
[SPEAKER_00]: least initial ideas for methods of
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp russet mites can likely survive year
round in indoor production environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: and possible on outdoor plants as well as
those indoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp russet mites can crawl only very
short distances, and immature stages are
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly immobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be a little more
localized at those stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, adults are capable of crawling,
and they move to the edge of leaves where
[SPEAKER_00]: they can then be picked up or carried by
air currents.
[SPEAKER_00]: In closed areas, fans can quickly spread
mites as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because they themselves cannot
fly, because they're so small,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very easy for them to get picked up
in wind or fans and be dispersed that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor small breezes can distribute the
mites through a field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So indoor we have those fans, outdoor
small breezes, easily to spread them even
[SPEAKER_00]: though they themselves may not be able to
fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the identification on the plant
look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they can develop on the upper leaf
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we go about identifying hemp
russet mites on the actual plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they can develop on the upper leaf
surface, as shown in the image,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the highest numbers are found
typically on the underside of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Infestations can result in a dull leaf
coloration, reduced leaf size,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also a reduction in plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of see that stunting going on right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf edge curl can be an indication,
but this same visual cue can also be a
[SPEAKER_00]: result of many other situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you have leaf curl doesn't
mean you have russet mites, but it is
[SPEAKER_00]: something you should be considering and at
least scouting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go about managing those russet
mites, what should you go about to do to
[SPEAKER_00]: manage them?
[SPEAKER_00]: As industrial hemp is a relatively new
legalized crop, many miticides utilized
[SPEAKER_00]: for specialty crops or field crops have
not yet been registered, so be sure to
[SPEAKER_00]: check your local and current regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Studies on citrus russet mites in Florida
and Israel show that the interruption of
[SPEAKER_00]: broad spectrum pesticide applications for
more than three years may increase
[SPEAKER_00]: populations of preditious mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: An industrial hemp making judicious use of
pesticides may be an effective tool to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce hemp russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oil-based miticides may have some
effectiveness, since they have been shown
[SPEAKER_00]: to be effective against spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talk about that leaf curl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leafs may curl upward near the petiole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So down here we're seeing relatively
normal flat appearance to the leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we are seeing near that petiole,
near that kind of central portion,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are seeing that tendency for them to
kind of curl upwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see the yellowation kind of
variegation here on the edge, yellow to
[SPEAKER_00]: the margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also be an indication of
potential nutrient deficiency,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also worthwhile to check with that
kind of high-end loop to be able to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through magnifying glass to check these
also for russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though they don't have the
traditional kind of little leaf curl at
[SPEAKER_00]: the petiole, still we're checking that
underside for those very small mites
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you're dealing with an insect
versus a nutrient deficiency, that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to change how you go about managing your
potential issue in your cannabis plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: a much different direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure you're putting time
and effort into the most effective method
[SPEAKER_00]: of correcting whatever problem you have,
but it starts with an accurate diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
