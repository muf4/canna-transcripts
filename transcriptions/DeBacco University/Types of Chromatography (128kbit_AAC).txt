[SPEAKER_00]: So while we all may think chromatography
is all the same, there's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll describe some of those key ones here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see here in the image is probably
what we're most familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a form of paper chromatography,
and it's separating out plant pigments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, there's different
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Chromatography in general can be
classified based on the type of mobile
[SPEAKER_00]: phase, stationary phase, and supporting
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be liquid chromatography,
gas chromatography, or supercritical
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatography if you're using a
supercritical fluid as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that liquid chromatography is an
analytical chromatography technique used
[SPEAKER_00]: for separating ions or molecules that are
dissolved in a solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's commonly used for liquid solvents,
such as a mobile phase and a column
[SPEAKER_00]: composed of solid beads, which would be
the stationary phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's varying types even within
liquid or LC chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see just one example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have something called gas
chromatography, or GC chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a technique used to analyze the
quantification of volatile compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This separates volatilized samples with a
carrier, a gas as the mobile phase,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a column composed of a liquid or solid
beads as the stationary phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at identifying certain
volatile compounds, paints, gasoline,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gas chromatography is something that can
be used for that in forensic science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paper chromatography is something you
might be familiar with, something you may
[SPEAKER_00]: have even done.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an analytical method that's used
to separate out colored chemicals and
[SPEAKER_00]: substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: It separates out the dried liquid samples
with a liquid solvent, the mobile phase,
[SPEAKER_00]: and paper strip is the stationary phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see an example of that here,
the beakers, and then some even just
[SPEAKER_00]: regular markers and water, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thin layer chromatography, we're getting a
little bit more specific here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is often called TLC chromatography,
and this is a technique used to separate
[SPEAKER_00]: nonvolatile mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can separate dried liquid samples
within a liquid solvent or mobile phase,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a glass plate is covered with a thin
layer of silicon gel as the stationary
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting a little bit more specific than
our paper chromatography, but again,
[SPEAKER_00]: still looking at nonvolatile mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those classifications are based on the
mobile phase used.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the gas chromatography,
we have the liquid chromatography,
[SPEAKER_00]: can automate some of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the type of mobile phase, whether it's
a gas or liquid, and we have machines also
[SPEAKER_00]: that can allow for a very high degree of
precision and repeatability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Classification based on that stationary
phase used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the name of the GC, the gas
chromatography methods, could be gas-solid
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatography, gas-liquid chromatography,
bond phase, types of stationary phase that
[SPEAKER_00]: could be used, solid, liquid-coated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different types that can be used,
and they'll be specific for the materials
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to study.
