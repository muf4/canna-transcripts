[SPEAKER_00]: In this Debaco University video,
we're going to go over how to set up a
[SPEAKER_00]: venturi style, or what's commonly referred
to as a Mazze fertilizer injector for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever wonder how to use a venturi or Mazze
fertilizer injector for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this video here is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into some of the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the method of operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: While chemicals are injected into a
pressurized pipe, using a venturi
[SPEAKER_00]: principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, basically, you have a large area,
a restricted area, and that's the venturi
[SPEAKER_00]: concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: The venturi injector is tapered,
as we can see right here, to constrict,
[SPEAKER_00]: which operates in the principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pressure drop accompanies the change
in the velocity of the water as it passes
[SPEAKER_00]: through the constriction point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pressure drop through the venturi must
be sufficient to create negative pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is essentially a vacuum to some
degree, and as measured relative to the
[SPEAKER_00]: atmospheric pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that result, that pressure loss may
cause it not to operate properly in
[SPEAKER_00]: systems that already have low pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you are going to, or these operate
with the change in pressure, if you
[SPEAKER_00]: already have low pressure to begin with,
this may not be the best option for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under those conditions, the fluid from the
tank will flow into the injector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have that pressure difference,
that vacuum, that negative pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to start to pull some of this
liquid up and inject it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most venturi injectors require at least
20% pressure differential.
[SPEAKER_00]: To initiate this negative pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A full vacuum of 20 inches of mercury is
obtained with a different pressure of 5%
[SPEAKER_00]: or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see here that also depending on
the size of your irrigation, they make
[SPEAKER_00]: different sized venturi operated
injectors, typically called Massey
[SPEAKER_00]: injectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this pressure drop is needed,
so small venturi can be used to inject
[SPEAKER_00]: small chemical flow rates to a relatively
large main line by shutting a portion of
[SPEAKER_00]: the flow through the injector.
[SPEAKER_00]: To assure that water will flow through the
shunt, a pressure drop must occur in the
[SPEAKER_00]: main line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our inlet and outlet sizes are the same,
but there will be a pressure reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, the injector is used to run a
point of restriction, such as a valve,
[SPEAKER_00]: orifice, or pressure regulator,
or other device, which creates a
[SPEAKER_00]: differential pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So placement of this could also be
important, just to ensure that it operates
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are some additional components
in here, gaskets and springs, also be
[SPEAKER_00]: mindful of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, basically very minimal
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the venturi advantage, so why would
someone choose to operate with this style?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that right here, is that it
doesn't require external power to operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does not really have any moving parts
associated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has a long operational life expectancy,
low probability of failure, both great
[SPEAKER_00]: things for growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resistant to many chemicals due to the
heavy plastic construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Requires minimal operator attention once
set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very low maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduced cost, definitely compared to some
other systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And adaptable to new or existing systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, assuming sufficient pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why these can be very popular
with many fertilizer injector systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at the liquid levels
I mentioned, venturi injectors come in
[SPEAKER_00]: various sizes and can be operated on
different pressure conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The suction capacity, or the injection
rate, head loss required, and working
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure range will depend on the model
you specifically select.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do that research ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is important to realize that suction
capacity depends on the liquid level in
[SPEAKER_00]: the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the liquid level drops,
the suction head increases, resulting in a
[SPEAKER_00]: decreased injection rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be some inconsistencies,
particularly using a very thin but tall
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: To avoid this problem, some manufacturers
provide an additional small tank on the
[SPEAKER_00]: side to supply a supply tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their float valve maintains the fluid
level relatively consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fluid is injected from this additional
tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this may cause inconsistent
fertilizer dilution rates at the start
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the end of the irrigation
cycle, unless you're injecting in water of
[SPEAKER_00]: the same fertilizer concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just a few little things to
consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is why this one is so popular,
because it offers a lot of advantages at
[SPEAKER_00]: really reduced cost, especially for
operations that have sufficient or
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
