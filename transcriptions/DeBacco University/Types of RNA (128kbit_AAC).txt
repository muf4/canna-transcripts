[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to go over
different types of RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up to this point, you might have thought
there's only one type of RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: When in fact, there's actually four main
different types of RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have them labeled here, mRNA,
tRNA, rRNA, and RNAi.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go through each of these in
detail and try to give an explanation in
[SPEAKER_00]: how they relate to cellular and biological
processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the main components for
protein production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's three key components that we
are of RNA that are required to make
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: mRNA, and that stands for messenger RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it labeled here, and it's
single-stranded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's producing a message or a single
strand of nucleic acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: tRNA is transfer RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that located over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So transfer RNA is transferring or reading
certain regions on the mRNA and
[SPEAKER_00]: transferring an amino acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's responsible for grabbing an amino
acid, bringing it to the mRNA sequence,
[SPEAKER_00]: and transferring that from some point in
the cell to developing a polypeptide
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our RNA is ribosomal RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one pictured over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this ribosomal RNA down here is what is
involved with protein production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a large and a small subunit,
and over here, the mRNA is basically going
[SPEAKER_00]: and being read across and going to the
rRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in the rRNA, we're noticing that
the mRNA is being protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the tRNA, located right here,
is what's coming into the ribosome,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's transferring the amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as a reminder, we're talking all
about RNA here, and that's ribonucleic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deoxyribonucleic acid is DNA, and that's
without that oxygen on that backbone sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep those in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so looking at mRNA in more detail,
remember, mRNA is in for messenger RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a short section of genetic material
encoded from a DNA molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's organized into three base pairs
called codons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see up here, we're noticing that
there's the three base pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the codons, and we can see them
kind of each little individual unit here
[SPEAKER_00]: working its way down all the way to the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of these three base pairs is a codon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now up here, we're noticing at the very
end, it says a stop codon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this stop codon is important because
each codon encodes for a specific amino
[SPEAKER_00]: acid sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the stop codon does not encode for an
amino acid sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually terminates protein synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a way of saying stop or end,
so to speak, and it is still a three base
[SPEAKER_00]: pair, and it's still a codon.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these A's, G's, C's, and U's are
the same nucleotides that we learned with
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA, keeping in mind that because we see
U, uracil, we are definitely looking at a
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: To continue on with messenger RNA,
there's actually two different subtypes of
[SPEAKER_00]: messenger RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have what we call pre-mRNA going to
mature mRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now don't confuse mature RNA as this M
being mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This mRNA here and here still stands for
messenger RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's pre-mRNA to mature messenger
RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-RNA contains introns which are
non-coding sequences, and we see those up
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are regions of the pre-RNA that
don't encode for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: These introns are spliced out or removed,
resulting in a continuous strain of exons,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what the mature mRNA is composed
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would there be non-coding regions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does this make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the event that there's a chance
that there's always gonna be a mutation
[SPEAKER_00]: that could occur, an error in the
nucleotide sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, while there is checks and balances
to try to prevent that, by having these
[SPEAKER_00]: introns, the hope is, or the odds are,
if one does occur, it may occur in one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these regions, and be spliced out and
removed, and basically having no impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: the final mRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contrast to that, if there was only this
mature mRNA produced, every single base
[SPEAKER_00]: pair would be absolutely necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's just one error somewhere,
it could really offset the sequence or
[SPEAKER_00]: type of amino acids, which could make the
protein non-functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: By having these introns, there's a chance
if there is a mistake, it could occur here
[SPEAKER_00]: and would not affect the final mRNA
sequence located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here the tRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, that stands for transfer RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is responsible for transferring or
bringing amino acids to the ribosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrogen bonds give the molecule its
distinctive T shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually does look like a T.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have two attachment sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down here, we have the codon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the anticodon region, which is going to
bind to the mRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So down here is gonna be where the mRNA is
gonna be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That anticodon is gonna have three pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's gonna bind to the
complementary mRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up top here, and in this region
here, we're gonna have the three prime
[SPEAKER_00]: region, which is where the amino acids
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attached and that amino acid is gonna be
attached there and it's gonna correspond
[SPEAKER_00]: with down below the particular codon
sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every tRNA does not necessarily have
the same amino acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The codon or anticodon down here signals
and allows only a specific type of amino
[SPEAKER_00]: acid to bind there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every tRNA has a specific binding site
at the mRNA region and it will correspond
[SPEAKER_00]: with a very specific amino acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sticking with tRNA provides a link between
the mRNA and the amino acid sequence of
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins by carrying the amino acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, down here is our codon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our anticodon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our tRNA and our amino acid being
linked up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each tRNA has a specific amino acid that
corresponds to a particular codon.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are some different codons
that have the same amino acid to help
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the chance of change in the amino
acid sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's redundancies built in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our RNA, continuing with ribosomal RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: 60% of the ribosome by weight is our RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other 40% is some proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds a little weird that there
takes proteins to make proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in this case, it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's slight differences between
prokaryotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, our bacteria and eukaryotic are
plants in our animal cells in size,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they perform the same function.
[SPEAKER_00]: This large S and small s stands for large
subunit and a small subunit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In prokaryotes, it's called 50S and small,
it's 30S.
[SPEAKER_00]: In eukaryotic, a large would be 80S and a
small would be 40S.
[SPEAKER_00]: The actual numbers aren't important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, the key part is to understand that
we have a larger unit, a smaller unit
[SPEAKER_00]: binding together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a small gap located right here,
and that's where the mRNA sequence,
[SPEAKER_00]: single-stranded, will work its way through
as we're going through the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: protein synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting it all together here, we have our
ribosome and our large subunit here and
[SPEAKER_00]: our small subunit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the little gap I was talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will see mRNA fits right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Encased inside these both large and small
subunits, we have our tRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: tRNA has an amino acid, and as these come
through, we're building that amino acid
[SPEAKER_00]: chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how these three main types of
RNA all come together to produce a chain
[SPEAKER_00]: of amino acids that will ultimately,
hopefully, produce a functional protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did mention one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one was what I called RNAi,
and it stands for RNA Interference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It inhibits gene expression by silencing
targeted mRNA sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's referred to as a gene knockdown or
silencer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a type of gene regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It develops a small, single-stranded RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Si stands for single-stranded and
induces a double-stranded RNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: dS RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA needs to be single-stranded here to be
efficiently copied, but when we have our
[SPEAKER_00]: RNAi, it's interfering with this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming through and it's binding with
this mRNA, causing it to be
[SPEAKER_00]: double-stranded, not really allowing for
it to be easily replicated in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ribosome, and that can stop the production
of a particular protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be because the cell may not
need that protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enough of that protein could be made
already, and it's a way to stop that
[SPEAKER_00]: protein production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cells do not want to continually keep
investing energy to produce proteins that
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't need.
[SPEAKER_00]: RNAi has increased in the number of
published scientific articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in 1997, 1998, very minimal number of
articles, and we see an exponential
[SPEAKER_00]: increase to 2005, so it's not even
super-current data, and it's continued to
[SPEAKER_00]: just produce a lot of published work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important because of its
contributions or it's the benefits that
[SPEAKER_00]: some of this can offer, particularly in
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage is that it could be used to
target diseases with minimal side effects
[SPEAKER_00]: due to the high degree of specificity,
meaning if we're looking to target a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular disease, we don't want to kill
every cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't only want to kill the disease
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, by having an RNAi, the potential is,
at least theoretically, if we found a very
[SPEAKER_00]: unique mRNA sequence, we could develop
these small single-stranded RNAs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they would bind to that mRNA,
causing it to be chopped up and basically
[SPEAKER_00]: stopping the production of proteins for a
given disease, and this could be very
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while this talks about the
theoretical sense, there is some
[SPEAKER_00]: real-world applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a timeline related to medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 1996, first demonstrated potential
in animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2010, first inhuman phase one clinical
trials began.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this phase one clinical trial may not
mean much, but I'm gonna go over what
[SPEAKER_00]: these refer to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phase one basically first to very early
stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both phase one and phase two clinical
trials show therapeutic applications in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only five years for this to occur is
pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 2017, currently, first inhuman
phase three trials begin, and that's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more advanced clinical trial, and that's
showing it's passing these certain phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these clinical trials, what do these
mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phase zero is just very basic effect on
the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phase one, we're getting into is it safe
in humans?
[SPEAKER_00]: That study can be designed to determine
effects of the drug, the device in humans,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually involves a small number of
volunteers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phase three is randomized trials,
and there's a controlled group compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: a placebo group, and it's kind of tested
against that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now into phase three trials,
which actually is quite exciting because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's testing the large-scale safety of its
effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: These studies involve randomized blind
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once phase three is complete, and this is
the key part, a company can request FDA
[SPEAKER_00]: approval for marketing of the drug,
and that's where it can become available
[SPEAKER_00]: to the mass public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that occurs, then phase four trials
can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very exciting to know that RNAi is
being involved with phase three trials,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it could be soon released to the
general public to be able to help prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: or cure or suppress certain diseases,
hopefully with very little side effects.
Thank you.
