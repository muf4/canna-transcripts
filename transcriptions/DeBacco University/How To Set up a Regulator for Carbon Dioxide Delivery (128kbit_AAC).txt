[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever wondered how to set up a
regulator for carbon dioxide delivery?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this Tobacco University video will
cover just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over how to set up a
regulator for carbon dioxide delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this picture here, we see we have
our carbon dioxide tank, we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure gauge, a flow meter, which is
basically kind of regulation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: process of the carbon dioxide that comes
out of the tank, an adjustment knob to
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust the flow, tubing, and a solenoid to
have that valve come off.
[SPEAKER_00]: On and off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sally looks like this tank is empty
looking at the pressure gauge,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this will, when you first have a
bottle, will come up and give you the idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of the pressure on your new bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what's the function of the
regulator?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to deliver the actual carbon dioxide
at a fixed flow rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The control determines the frequency and
duration of delivery, but it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulator that actually is having the rate
of delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: For simplicity, the regulator that would
be attached to a compressed CO2 bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: will be used for a model of comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can see that here, and they're
relatively common, and relatively simple
[SPEAKER_00]: in their workings as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the general components of
that regulator, as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an attachment nut with a washer
inside, and that's located right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and here we see it on the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a good idea to have some extra
washers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a bottle pressure gauge,
and we can see that here, and also located
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the flow rate, which is in the flow
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to check the units on your flow
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: An adjustment knob, in this case it's
located here, in this case it'd be right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The actual on-off electronic valve,
or solenoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this one located right here,
and this one's right off to the side here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the power cord that comes off this
goes directly to the controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the dispensing point of CO2,
which is located right here with what we
[SPEAKER_00]: see, some black tubing attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see the barbed fitting,
which would have CO2 dispensing tubing
[SPEAKER_00]: applied to it right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The washer should be in here, and it's
always advantageous and recommended to
[SPEAKER_00]: have an extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the importance of these
washers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can see them located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have extras and replaces needed in the
sense that this is what's going to stop
[SPEAKER_00]: leaking carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nylon washers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're naturally, as you come right in
there, could have some extras because they
[SPEAKER_00]: either sometimes can take a set,
or they can fall off and get lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really advantageous to eliminate
any wasting CO2 by having this washer in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once connected and tightened, so you go
through here, we have our little regulator
[SPEAKER_00]: tightened up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have the extra washer zip-tied
right to there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good place to put them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to read over the regulator's
instructions, but typically on an average
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once all the systems are set up,
you can turn on the carbon dioxide bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: by slowly rotating the top to the on
position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Avoid just opening the valve and the CO2
rushing into the closed valve,
[SPEAKER_00]: as this could damage critical internal
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to try to be as careful as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of just releasing that carbon
dioxide bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of pressure in very new
bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the system is pressurized when
the gauge provides a pressure reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right here, the carbon dioxide bottle
would be off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will come up and give you a
pressure reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: A full bottle, the pressure should be
around 1,000 psi or 7,000 kPa,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is going to put you generally in
this kind of range right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, depends on what you're filling the
bottles to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't expect this to go all the way to
full.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be pretty much around 1,000
psi or under.
[SPEAKER_00]: And temperature will also have an effect
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once pressurized, you should listen
carefully for any potential leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The system should be silent unless the
sensor's coming on and actually dosing
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you hear a slight hissing sound,
investigate all connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen carefully to all areas of the
valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you cannot determine the exact
area, there is a trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the soapy water trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hear that little hissing snake
noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does soapy water come into play
with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you take your regulator in areas
where you're going to have carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: moving, and you add soapy water to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you suspect the regulator or some
other part of the carbon dioxide system
[SPEAKER_00]: has a leak, take some water and add some
soapy water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that evident right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the level there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to look where the bubbles will
form because the soapy water with that
[SPEAKER_00]: little leaking is going to cause little
bubbles to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the soapy water solution and apply it
to the regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So add a little soap to the water,
stir it up, and then just apply it over
[SPEAKER_00]: the regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: If air is leaking, you will see small
bubbles forming to pinpoint the exact area
[SPEAKER_00]: of the leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see this connection right here
is failing because we're seeing the little
[SPEAKER_00]: bubbles being blown by the leaking,
escaping air here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, easy, quick little trick that I've
used myself, and it works wonders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what adjustments do you make to your
regulator?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have all these options and flow rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you adjust it to?
[SPEAKER_00]: So regulating the flow rate can depend on
the size of the growing space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Running the flow rate too high in a small
grow space will cause large swings in
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide levels, making it difficult
to control the levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they go too high, then get too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Running the flow rate too slow will cause
the target levels not to be reached in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I typically find to not go above 10 CFM,
which is cubic feet per minute,
[SPEAKER_00]: as this may cause the regulator to freeze
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what does a regulator freeze up look
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when you have one fail and the rate
goes way too fast or way too long,
[SPEAKER_00]: you actually get a kind of strong chilling
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be a prime example of
regulator freeze up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This occurs when the flow rate of carbon
dioxide is too fast and there is a strong
[SPEAKER_00]: cooling effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see right out of the bottle,
no problem, but where it's kind of here is
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's kind of flowing, that's where
you have that strong cooling effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The carbon dioxide is cold when it goes
from the compressed state to the
[SPEAKER_00]: uncompressed state, and that's why you're
getting that massive chilling effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can happen even in hot grow spaces,
such as greenhouses or high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is a problem with your regulator,
the valve gets stuck open.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can cause the bottle to empty quickly,
resulting in a frozen regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an example here of a regulator
that had failed, got stuck open,
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't close, and dispensed a lot of
carbon dioxide in a very short period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time, resulting in regulator freeze up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the suggested flow rates, this is just
one example of one of the regulators
[SPEAKER_00]: shooting for 1,200 parts per million,
looking at your cubic feet of your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space and then your cubic feet per hour
that you should be injecting to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you an idea of at least a starting
point, and then you can make adjustments
[SPEAKER_00]: from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great way to kind of look at
and understand to be as efficient with
[SPEAKER_00]: your regulator for enriching your growing
space with carbon dioxide.
