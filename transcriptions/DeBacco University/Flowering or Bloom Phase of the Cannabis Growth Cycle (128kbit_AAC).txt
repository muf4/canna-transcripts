[SPEAKER_00]: So on this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to go over the flowering or
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom phase of the cannabis growth cycle
and show you a little bit of some images
[SPEAKER_00]: so you get an idea of the duration of
flowering phase related to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over the flowering or
bloom phase of cannabis growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the flowering stage length.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the flowering stage is the final
growth stage of the cannabis plant and is
[SPEAKER_00]: when the buds are produced and maturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is typically in weeks eight to 11 of
the growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most strains flower in eight to nine weeks
of the growth phase, just to give you an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some can take even longer, particularly
those that are sativa dominant strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are wonders like wonders there in
flower, what week in flower are they in?
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of offers a good visual guide as
far as the flowering phase, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: initially week one, two weeks in the
flower, three, four, five, six,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven and eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see how that progression does
change as far as weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this may depend a little bit on the
variety you might be growing, but at least
[SPEAKER_00]: this provides a general kind of overview
of the stage of flower your plants might
[SPEAKER_00]: be in, particularly determine when those
early weeks are occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, flowering stage for outdoor and
indoor production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, outdoor plants will initiate
flowering naturally when the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: receives 12 hours of light or less each
day, which occurs in summer transition
[SPEAKER_00]: into fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor growers can trigger the flowering
cycle by reducing the photo period to 12
[SPEAKER_00]: hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a little bit more control and
better timing of when that exactly occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the flowering kind of sub phases,
kind of like the stages of fetal
[SPEAKER_00]: development here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering initiation is at one to three
weeks and that's the plants continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow in physical size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-female flowers produce the pistils,
which are the thin little white cat-like
[SPEAKER_00]: whisker hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into the mid flowering phase,
which is approximately weeks four to five
[SPEAKER_00]: and the plant vegetatively will kind of
stop or at least slow in growing as the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant focuses more on the bud development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into late flowering or
ripening, which is basically week six and
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is trichome density will be
noticeably increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Color of the pistils will also change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives you, again, another
indication of are you in initiation of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering, mid flowering or late flowering
phase of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, grower tips during the flowering
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do not prune the plants during this
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants should be trellis to support heavy
bud production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could see here excessive outdoor
production, trellis saying doesn't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: be super fancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just looking at a way of plant
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers will typically feed bloom
fertilizer to plants that have high
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations of phosphorus, but consider
the substrate and be careful how much you
[SPEAKER_00]: add to avoid negative environmental
effects and limited positive effects to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, phosphorus is needed, but I find a
lot of growers are over applying it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the flowering phase,
the plants that we have, the flower buds
[SPEAKER_00]: will be visually developed quickly towards
the end of the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll go about how to kind of go
through and look at all the wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: little trichomes densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting a magnifying loop would be great
to inspect these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could go through and determine the
peak ripeness of your particular flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of it has to do with the setting
up those plants during the vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: phase, recognizing the stages of
development in the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can ideally have a good harvest,
dry and cure phase as well.
