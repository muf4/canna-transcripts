[SPEAKER_00]: This Tobacco University video is going to
cover sometimes called the mysterious CBC
[SPEAKER_00]: or CBCA cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so let's get into CBC and CBCA
cannabinoids here produced in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off a great research article if
you want to learn a little bit more of
[SPEAKER_00]: information you have the proper citation
here so you can expand your knowledge even
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off as I said kind of mysterious
kind of CBCA or CBC of the major side
[SPEAKER_00]: chain cannabinoids the least is known
about CBCA or CBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly to all of the other cannabinoids
it has shown to have some antimicrobial
[SPEAKER_00]: properties but again we're trying to
understand this one a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is synthesized by cannabis in the same
way as THC-A and CBD-A and it synthesized
[SPEAKER_00]: it also produces the phytotoxic
byproducts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know a little bit about the pathway
we know a little bit about what it's how
[SPEAKER_00]: it's produced a little about the side
products that are that produce the
[SPEAKER_00]: byproducts but still remains a little
mysterious.
[SPEAKER_00]: However to provide you some information
about this particular cannabinoid since
[SPEAKER_00]: often asked what is CBC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it's a powerful non psychoactive
cannabinoid it will not cause the high
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preclinical unpublished so again keep that
in mind a study did demonstrate anti-tumor
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of both CBG as well as CBC against
gastrointestinal cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again unpublished research pre kind of
clinical trials but give some at least
[SPEAKER_00]: some indication of potential good for
future research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both these cannabinoids were shown to
induce significantly higher rates of
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer cell death compared to other
cannabinoids and suggests a need for
[SPEAKER_00]: further investigation into synergistic
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All important there and has some early
promise for something that we currently
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know a ton about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also relate to inflammation so CBC battles
inflammation by activating the CB2
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: However because it does not activate CB1
the healing properties of CBC could be
[SPEAKER_00]: enhanced when combined with cannabinoids
that do such as THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again you're getting into this kind of
synergistic effect there not knowing a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about it but early indications do have
some potential medical promise as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: potential combination with other
cannabinoids to get the greatest positive effect.
