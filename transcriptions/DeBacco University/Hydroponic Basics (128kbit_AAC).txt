[SPEAKER_00]: Here we'll look at some of the basics of
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a great image here of showing some
plants being grown hydroponically,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is not the only way plants can be
grown for it still to be counted as,
[SPEAKER_00]: or classified as, hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, hydroponics is the science
of growing plants without soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think hydroponics means
purely grown in water, but that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily the case, because this can
include rock well coconut fiber,
[SPEAKER_00]: clay pebbles, and others that do not
contain a high mineral base content.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these would still be classic or
classified technically as hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The addition of these or more traditional
aerated water conditions are also
[SPEAKER_00]: classified as hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think of like if you're growing plants
in water or some form of aerated water,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is hydroponics, and that's typically
what's associated when someone says
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind rock well coconut fiber
and clay pebbles can also be classified as
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponics, simply because they give very
little minerals to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now hydroponic production allows growers
to have near complete control over
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this row of tomatoes grown in
the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are grown in rock well, but again,
this is classified as hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the reason why is this allows for
higher yields than soil production.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, growers also can incorrectly feed
the plant, which can reduce overall
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because you can control everything that
plant is getting with the exact nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions, exact concentrations,
that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have great control, but with that comes
great responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with great control, comes great
responsibility, and this is where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize yields, but the grower can also
sadly mess things up if they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages, as I said, efficient
production per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see very little area being used
here, ideally getting high yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grower has control over the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, can yield better than soil
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also very clean and sterile to try to
eliminate or reduce the chance of getting
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages are it can be
expensive to initially set up,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can have a more complex setup and
arrangement, does require time and
[SPEAKER_00]: technical knowledge, some costs to ideally
have good quality, need to have continual
[SPEAKER_00]: monitoring of the operation, and it's not
as forgiving as soil production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a little bit more dialed in,
can add nutrients very quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: but can also go nutrient deficient as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Limitations for hydroponics is burning the
roots and nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to watch that pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure you're not
overfeeding the plants either.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to ensure nutrient solutions are
well mixed before adding them to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep the root zone area
oxygenated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind the roots, no matter how
small or large, do need an oxygen source
[SPEAKER_00]: because they are respiring and taking in
that oxygen, breaking down those sugars so
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keeping that pH of that water correct
and keeping that aeration are very
[SPEAKER_00]: important things with any hydroponic
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
