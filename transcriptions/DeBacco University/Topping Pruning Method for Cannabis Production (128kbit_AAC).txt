[SPEAKER_00]: If you're considering topping your
cannabis plants and wondered a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more about that method, this Tobacco
University video is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into topping as a
pruning method for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what is topping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's called tipping,
sometimes it's also called pinching the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of shows a great little image of
that, what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are all forms of pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each has their own preference to where a
grower will physically choose to top or to
[SPEAKER_00]: cut the plant off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Topping is removing the growing tip from
the main stem that will give you basically
[SPEAKER_00]: two stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be performed multiple times to
get more stems and branches, as we see
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically this is done when the plant
is at four to five nodes or so up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not done at the very beginning,
not done really late, typically four to
[SPEAKER_00]: five nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, grower's choice and it can be
depending on the growing situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the variety they might be
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much to top?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you go through and how much to
go through in topping?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that evident right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that pinch point?
[SPEAKER_00]: We see those two additional kind of
growing points that where there was one,
[SPEAKER_00]: now there'll be two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers will simply pinch the tip of
an actively growing portion of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others like to take three plus nodes off
to get the bonus material as a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take a little bit more,
you can take that off, you get the pinch
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, you're going to grow into two,
with that cutting you just took off,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can now go through and clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, an additional bonus is the plant
will be larger and slightly more developed
[SPEAKER_00]: so it can push out of this stress a little
bit easier than recovery time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, if you do it when it's plants
is very small, if you're moving the water,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to produce new leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can cause a little bit of a lag time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why some growers prefer to wait
a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, up to the growers or growers
choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So topping an autoflower, would that be
advised?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's strain dependent, as there can be
various levels of success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, it's best to top an auto early
in life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is suggested to be before day 21,
with day 14 kind of being the target.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fourth node can also provide a good
marker for growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics need to be an aggressive grower
to maximize yield, particularly if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this pruning method with an
autoflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's happening in the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're having this kind of hormone
shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Removing the actively growing tip removes
the concentration of oxygen in the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: taking that tip off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxin reduces lateral bud formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you remove the tip, you're
removing the highest concentration of
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen here, as we see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that does is that basically now
causes the plant to grow lateral branches
[SPEAKER_00]: more aggressively.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also done a lot with poinsettias.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this removing of the apical meristem,
removing the oxygen will now induce
[SPEAKER_00]: lateral buds to grow, which is a great
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to take a quick look at an
example of this kind of method of pruning
[SPEAKER_00]: in an outdoor grown plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit later in the season,
but just to show you kind of what the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants may look like if you wait a little
bit later to go through this plant topping
[SPEAKER_00]: method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many times growers want to know kind of
how does a pruning style affect the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly getting to the end of
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is a prime example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at this plant, the apical
meristem was removed, meaning the central
[SPEAKER_00]: stalk was cut, was topped essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they only call it topping their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're noticing when we take out
that apical meristem, unlike the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: over here where we're maintaining the
apical meristem, we get one large bud and
[SPEAKER_00]: the others kind of suffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're cutting it right here,
getting side branching to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So removing the oxygen, it's a plant
hormone and that will kind of induce side
[SPEAKER_00]: branches to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the advantage of growing a lot
of side branches?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as you can see here, without that
apical meristem, now we're getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more of a consistent harvest on
some of the side branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're noticing that all the buds
still are pointing upwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though this is kind of growing out
in that kind of V slash Y pattern,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the buds will still point up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intention is, and this is maybe done
just a little bit late here in the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what the intention is to get more even
buds throughout the top here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of having just that one central
main bud, now we're getting more buds that
[SPEAKER_00]: are larger in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just a different pruning style,
but this kind of shows that topping may
[SPEAKER_00]: have occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it occurs by the grower actually
cutting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes in the outdoor environment in
particular, the wind may kind of select
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but this just kind of shows the end
result that you can get from topping a plant.
