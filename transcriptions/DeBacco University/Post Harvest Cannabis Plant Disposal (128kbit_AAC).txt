[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to go over post-harvest cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant disposal as it's something indoor
growers as well as outdoor growers need to
[SPEAKER_00]: take into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into post-harvest
cannabis plant disposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I want to think about the
post-harvest waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the goal is to only harvest the
buds, there is a lot of plant biomass that
[SPEAKER_00]: is not needed and becomes waste products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is speaking to plants that we're
not looking at producing fiber for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers need to keep this in mind to also
have this as a plan for disposing of this
[SPEAKER_00]: excess of plant material if really the
only end goal result is the actual buds
[SPEAKER_00]: and flowers and the leaves maybe
immediately surrounding those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind this is more than just
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the plants are a source of waste,
but you also need to consider other plant
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may depend on your growing situation,
again, whether you're an indoor grower or
[SPEAKER_00]: an outdoor grower, but regardless,
growers need to take into account all
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material and supporting plant
material into consideration when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to waste disposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for indoor operations, indoor
operations have some situations that are
[SPEAKER_00]: not present for outdoor growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, indoor growers have to
consider how they're going to dispose of
[SPEAKER_00]: their containers, the substrate that they
might be using, as well as the lights such
[SPEAKER_00]: as the bulbs and ballasts that they might
be using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll have a separate video of really
focused on indoor growing operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for outdoor growing operations,
they're not immune either to considering
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest disposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor growing operations have some
situations that are not present for
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They a lot of times have weed control
products, such as plastics, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: that need to be disposed of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irrigation equipment, also an important
consideration for items that will need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be disposed of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're an outdoor grower,
I have a separate video on that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but keep in mind in both situations,
indoor and outdoor, there are post-harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: disposal methods, post-harvest waste
products that growers need to be mindful
[SPEAKER_00]: and considerate of when they're trying to
implement some sort of growing practice so
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't get caught at the end of the
season with a large area to dispose of a
[SPEAKER_00]: large volume of material outside of the
plants that they may not have considered.
Thank you for watching.
See you next time.
