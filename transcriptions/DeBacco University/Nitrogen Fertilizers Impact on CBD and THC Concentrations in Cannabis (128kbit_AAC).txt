[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this DeBacco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be going over nitrogen
fertilizer's impact on CBD and THC
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations in cannabis, giving you an
indication of how much nitrogen fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be giving and what might be too
much and one of the negative effects by
[SPEAKER_00]: giving too much nitrogen fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the video here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is the research article,
so if you want to find out some more
[SPEAKER_00]: information about this or look at some
more materials and methods, you're more
[SPEAKER_00]: than welcome to via the link provided
here, but I'm going to give you a general
[SPEAKER_00]: summary and kind of give you a grower
viewpoint of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of most important here is the
actual research trials that they did and
[SPEAKER_00]: the results that they got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the graphs that we see over
here, note that the total biomass and
[SPEAKER_00]: total cannabinoid concentrations in
percent dry weight are on the y-axis,
[SPEAKER_00]: the vertical axis, and this is versus the
measured nitrogen concentrations in
[SPEAKER_00]: percent dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be on the x-axis here,
so it's kind of what you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have some correlation lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the triangular points that you see
kind of here and here identify plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: the north and west-facing edge of the
glass house and that's where these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: were grown as part of this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're considered above the regression
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can see here, the regression line is
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: An average had higher values than the dot
points and the dot points are those little
[SPEAKER_00]: circles and those dot points in the same
grass were indicated plants not on the
[SPEAKER_00]: edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the triangle plants here give you the
idea that those were on the sun edge and
[SPEAKER_00]: the circles were not on the sun edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this also speaks to the importance of
light and concentration of light,
[SPEAKER_00]: the intensity of light your plants are
getting, how that can influence things as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took that into consideration here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, looking at the general trend,
we could see that biomass in grams here is
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing, which is, you know,
everyone thinks that'd be better,
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger, quote, better plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we'll notice as the biomass
increased, we see all these other
[SPEAKER_00]: regression lines going the opposite
direction and those are looking at total
[SPEAKER_00]: CBC, total CBD and total THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a negative correlation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also did a little study on pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to focus more here on the
nitrogen treatment as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I said, it's an inverse
relationship here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the increase in biomass is nitrogen
concentration increased from three to six
[SPEAKER_00]: was approximately 100% and this is why you
want to be careful of the scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at the Y axis, just to go
back for a second here, we could see
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass in grams is 100 to 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like doubling in size here,
just to give you a little bit of idea what
[SPEAKER_00]: those numbers actually mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the corresponding decreases I
pointed out in the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration was approximately 67%.
[SPEAKER_00]: This entails a net decline in yields in
terms of grams as nitrogen concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you get excessive in nitrogen and
that comes higher and higher, your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid concentration is decreasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the little brackets mean here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw the example of the seesaw here
because as nitrogen's going up,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an inverse relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabinoid concentration is
decreasing, which of course growers don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of your general key points is that
biomass was strongly and positively
[SPEAKER_00]: related to nitrogen fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoid concentrations were strongly
negative related to nitrogen and plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sun edge tended to have higher biomass
levels in cannabinoid concentrations
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to those grown in the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those high nitrogen levels,
those high nitrogen, those nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: raised in those high nitrogen levels in
both the inflorescence, the flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also the leaf plant matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: For very high levels of nitrogen
nutrition, which is defined as 500
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams per milliliter, inflorescence
in cannabinoid concentrations decreased
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly with little change in total
biomass and leaf biomass also increased
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: With higher nitrogen supplied,
stem diameter also increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a sign of kind of a nitrogen bloat
growers may say to their plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the net effect of increasing nitrogen
nutrition on the total yield of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids was negative because of the
increase in biomass, which was only
[SPEAKER_00]: significant in the leaves, kind of that
extra giant growth you might have on the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not enough though to offset the
constant decrease in cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're getting a little to these
excessive levels, getting a bigger plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're decreasing our total yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which should not be our goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look at our cannabinoid concentration
as well as cannabinoid yield per plant
[SPEAKER_00]: were decreased with the increased supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we kind of explain this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of looking at a general
fertilizer curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we get our nutrient supply,
as we go from left to right, we're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: more fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the y-axis here, we're looking at
crop yield, higher yield being better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a certain point that if
you're growing in soil and don't add any
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer, you're going to get a certain
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, probably going to be below
what growers are aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they add fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can add fertilizer and you have
this kind of initially almost a linear
[SPEAKER_00]: increase, but then it kind of like levels
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of like reaches this kind of peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this maximum yield point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you keep adding fertilizer beyond
that maximum yield point, what ends up
[SPEAKER_00]: happening is that you start to get a
decrease in return.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are you increasing your cost,
but you're going to decrease on return.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're seeing here,
the correlation with the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very high concentrations of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also did it here in ounces per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know it's a pretty big range,
but it is a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure you're definitely
not outside that range because you'll try
[SPEAKER_00]: to get over to where that yield curve is
going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now pruning's impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to mention it here that they
did a double spend pruning was applied as
[SPEAKER_00]: an additional treatment to investigate
efficiency and biomass increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pruning treatment did not increase
cannabinoid concentration or affect
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass when measured at the final
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to make note of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on the graphs that we saw earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now study also evaluated the sun edge
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to just touch on that because
across all treatments as an artifact of
[SPEAKER_00]: this trial, sun edge plants were the most
directly exposed to sunlight showed a
[SPEAKER_00]: trend towards more biomass in higher
cannabinoid concentrations, according to
[SPEAKER_00]: the model that they did statistics wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Self shading of plants can limit the
production of cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to consider plant
density and light intensity and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum your plants are receiving for
those growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, these results can only be
considered preliminary because it warrants
[SPEAKER_00]: further research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just showing you for those growing
maybe indoors, how can you relate this
[SPEAKER_00]: study that we want to really make sure
we're getting high PAR to our plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: across all areas as we saw a dramatic
effect here with the sun edge plants
[SPEAKER_00]: versus those grown in row, how that can
affect things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more than just nitrogen,
but that is important consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to over at it because
you're simply be reducing your yields and
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing your costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that's helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other videos on this channel about
nitrogen fertilizer, but this gives you
[SPEAKER_00]: another study to investigate.
Thank you.
