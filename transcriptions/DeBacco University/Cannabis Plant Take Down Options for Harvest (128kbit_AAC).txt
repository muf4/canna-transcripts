[SPEAKER_00]: Here in this Tobacco University video,
we're going to look at two main options
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to taking down cannabis
plants for the initiation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get a cannabis plant
takedown options for harvest to see which
[SPEAKER_00]: one might fit your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to harvesting the plants,
cannabis plants are typically large and
[SPEAKER_00]: bulky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to removing them,
it can present many challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there are a couple options,
the end goal and result is essentially the
[SPEAKER_00]: same of kind of getting them ready for
that drying and ultimately that curing
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about the size of your operations?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are important considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the size of your operation,
this may essentially make the decision for
[SPEAKER_00]: you if you should go with kind of a manual
harvest option or if you go with a
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanized harvest option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this does not necessarily mean large
operations always need to be mechanically
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested, but you need to make sure you
have the right labor for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smaller operations though should stick
typically with the manual harvest because
[SPEAKER_00]: it just becomes too cumbersome to work
potentially with mechanized harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Larger operations have a choice of kind of
mechanized is staff, if you're staff
[SPEAKER_00]: limited or go with the manual route,
there's enough people to make this process
[SPEAKER_00]: feasible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also comes into play with where you
can get the equipment in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even large indoor grow operations can
be very difficult to get equipment into
[SPEAKER_00]: these rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times they are forced into the
manual harvest option simply just because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the space constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're looking at manual harvest,
well, the advantage is that it does not
[SPEAKER_00]: require any specialized equipment,
allows for growers to specifically harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: sections of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is very time consuming
and does require the most labor and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of constant labor as you're going
through harvesting, stacking, removing all
[SPEAKER_00]: the pots, going through that and that
regards here with the indoor operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same so with an outdoor operation,
does require that kind of stacking,
[SPEAKER_00]: removing and that kind of constantly
handling and touching the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also though mechanized options
here, typically done with large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp, but it's a very quick method,
can be very efficient for large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: operations as we see here with again,
the large scale hemp operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disadvantages is it does require
specialized equipment as we see here and
[SPEAKER_00]: it can damage buds and plant material
because again, it doesn't have that
[SPEAKER_00]: delicate touch necessarily, but sometimes
the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on your growing operation,
whatever plant takedown option for harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: you think best fits your situation,
you can search this channel and get more
[SPEAKER_00]: details on that particular method of
harvesting or taking down your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
