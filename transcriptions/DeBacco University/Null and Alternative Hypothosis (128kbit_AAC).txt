[SPEAKER_00]: You may be familiar with the term
hypothesis, but there's actually two
[SPEAKER_00]: different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a null and alternative hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to explore what the difference
is between these two here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the null hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: No hypothesis is valid if it cannot be
tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: No test is valid if its results cannot
disprove the hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is related to the null hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The null hypothesis is the formal
statement of that hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know right now you're probably going
through and reading this and determining
[SPEAKER_00]: that this doesn't really make a whole lot
of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to use an example in the next
slide that I think will help this process
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The alternative hypothesis, though,
expects a difference or an effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the null hypothesis is kind of like
saying nothing happened, and the alternate
[SPEAKER_00]: there is saying, oh, look, there was a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the researcher seeks to prove through
testing is what the alternative hypothesis
[SPEAKER_00]: involves with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the opposite of the null.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, something did happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an output.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does this look kind of in an
example?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's an example here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the effect of fertilizer
X on plumped and grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our alternative hypothesis,
this is what the researcher attempts to
[SPEAKER_00]: prove.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this alternative hypothesis here,
what's the researcher trying to prove?
[SPEAKER_00]: Application of fertilizer X increases
pumpkin growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The null hypothesis, keep in mind,
is the opposite of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still looking at the effect of
fertilizer X on pumpkin growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the null hypothesis would be
application of fertilizer X does not
[SPEAKER_00]: increase pumpkin growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This null hypothesis, what the researcher
attempts to disprove.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in an example here, attempting to
disprove the fact that there is no effect
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's trying to show that this will
increase pumpkin growth here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Null is like, nothing happens there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're running our tests, though,
we look at these two hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to minimize results based on
chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, we're going to have something
called a control group, checking to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure the same results will not occur
without test intervention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the control group here with mice,
looking at non-obese mice and obese mice
[SPEAKER_00]: and comparing some factors here and things
that were measured, particularly fat group
[SPEAKER_00]: and control group and calories from fat
and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this idea of a control group what is
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go back to our previous example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in here would be our control group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our control group would make the pumpkin
plants grown with no fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be our control group in the sense
that maybe just the soil they're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in naturally makes them grow a little bit
better or worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our control group is sometimes the
group that we poke do nothing to and they
[SPEAKER_00]: might just get water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we could have an example here of
getting smaller doses of fertilizer or
[SPEAKER_00]: greater doses of fertilizer the control
group in this case would be those that got
[SPEAKER_00]: no fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you always to think that the
control group is something that you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: do anything to.
[SPEAKER_00]: An alternate kind of example for our
pumpkin plants again would be if we gave
[SPEAKER_00]: plants fertilizer that the bag
recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at a bag that recommends a
tablespoon per gallon of fertilizer X,
[SPEAKER_00]: that could also be our control group.
[SPEAKER_00]: That control group is getting the labeled
or the recommended rate of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that control group in summary is
just something that you want to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: compare to and to make sure you're not
getting the same results that occur
[SPEAKER_00]: without the modifications that you're
making to the test group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, minimizing the results based on
chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of stats that can be
done here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Checking to see if the same result could
be caused by chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example how likely to get four heads in a
row when flipping coins randomly versus
[SPEAKER_00]: always starting with the coin on tails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be something that you could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your goal is to develop an observed data
point that is consistently beyond the
[SPEAKER_00]: control or in this case the average here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would be the typical average.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could look at average height in a
grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be the average height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking for something here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very unlikely these would be the very tall
kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: These would be the very short kids here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using stats and statistical analysis
to determine that hey there's results that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're seeing may not be based on chance
but might be influenced by the test
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters that we're instituting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of just a general overview of
our null and ultimate hypothesis and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully the example here of looking at
fertilizer on plant growth is a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of be able to better understand the
comparison between these two.
