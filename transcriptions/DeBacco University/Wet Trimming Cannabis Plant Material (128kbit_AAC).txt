[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over some more details to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain dry trimming of cannabis plant
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into wet trimming
cannabis plant material and learn a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more about this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wet trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we're wet trimming yields a
higher flower to trim ratio, but requires
[SPEAKER_00]: more equipment and has less room for
error.
[SPEAKER_00]: A wet trimming method involves cutting the
plant down followed immediately by the
[SPEAKER_00]: removal of the fan leaves and detailed
trimming of the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: After this is completed, then the drying
process can begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This process is common for very large
growing operations since there is
[SPEAKER_00]: typically not enough drying space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So performing an initial wet trim is
needed to reduce the overall biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: before the drying process can actually
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're kind of going through harvesting
the plant and trimming it right away,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of immediately after harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the benefits to this method is that
wet trimming is recommended by growers
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the greater trichrome
preservation and quicker harvesting time,
[SPEAKER_00]: all with less space needed for the actual
drying process because you're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: removing all the plant material that you
really don't need anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buds can kind of puff out, appealing
larger and more aesthetically pleasing in
[SPEAKER_00]: some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commercial growers typically see the puff
out as a huge reason to wet trim to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of create that visual effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also makes the drying process faster
by removing much of the moisture in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and can help reduce the stress on
your drying equipment if you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain, which hopefully you are,
certain humidity levels in the drying
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the problems with wet trimming,
because it's not a perfect method,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that it's not as clean as a process as
dry trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with wet trimming, we know some residue
buildup on the shears, which will need
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the takedown of the plants followed
immediately by trimming also compresses
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the required work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That needs to be accomplished and this can
make it a very difficult process to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to complete all in one fellow swoop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working at commercial harvesting locations
with commercial harvesting, often speed
[SPEAKER_00]: and efficiency is important, which is part
of the reason why wet trimming can be
[SPEAKER_00]: selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wet trimming is also faster compared to
the detail orientedness of dry trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there will likely be some
trichrome loss since the drying process,
[SPEAKER_00]: there will not be any sugar leaves to
provide protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of volume and reduced time to
sale can hurt individual bud quality as
[SPEAKER_00]: wet trim material may not reach top
quality that can be achieved with a dry
[SPEAKER_00]: trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of a very important thing
to note there is that while it might be an
[SPEAKER_00]: easier, quicker process, it might hurt or
reduce your overall bud quality if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing it to a dry trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that reason and that reason alone is
why many growers will only go through the
[SPEAKER_00]: dry trim process and will not do anything
with a wet trim process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that there are kind of some
advantages to wet trim and that's why some
[SPEAKER_00]: growers do elect to utilize the wet trim
option of their cannabis plants.
