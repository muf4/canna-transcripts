[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, yes, you read that title correctly
lactic acid does not cause muscle burn So
[SPEAKER_00]: let's go into kind of the misconception of
why it does and what actually is causing
[SPEAKER_00]: that muscle burn you're feeling So when
you exercise the source of energy is
[SPEAKER_00]: glucose and it's broken down to pyruvate
Pyruvate is then used in either aerobic if
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen is present or anaerobic
Fermentation with no oxygen present
[SPEAKER_00]: process both yield ATP, which is the
energy currency of the cell but very
[SPEAKER_00]: different amounts So when there's a lack
of oxygen you're generating about two
[SPEAKER_00]: ATP's and aerobic you're generating a lot
more We're all saying this lactic acid
[SPEAKER_00]: being generated in an anaerobic
Environment there we can see the person
[SPEAKER_00]: here these training their muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're running through a lot of ATP Now
aerobic respiration involves a citric acid
[SPEAKER_00]: or Krebs cycle oxidative phosphorylation,
which is the process of generating ATP
[SPEAKER_00]: with no negative byproducts from either
and high ATP production this is why The
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen or utilizing oxygen is so efficient
because not a lot of negative products
[SPEAKER_00]: generated and a very efficient way of
generating lots of ATP So what causes the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual burn to the muscles if it's not
this lactic acid Well, it's release of
[SPEAKER_00]: protons during the ATP breakdown that's
increasing the acidity resulting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: burning feeling So in short, yes,
it is an acid It's simply just not lactic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid because remember The increasing
proton concentration will create an acidic
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a hydrogen ions Amount increases we
have this acidic environment that's being
[SPEAKER_00]: created is this acid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Environment that causes the burning
feeling that reduction in pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're seeing here is our ATP
Being broken down and you'll notice there
[SPEAKER_00]: is that release from ATP to ADP benzene
triphosphate to benzene diphosphate There
[SPEAKER_00]: is a breaking of that phosphate group And
also this all-important release of
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen ion causing a decrease in pH
resulting in acidic environment causing
[SPEAKER_00]: the burn So lactic acids and lactates role
well the terms are lactate and lactic acid
[SPEAKER_00]: are often used interchangeably But lactate
is the component measured in the blood
[SPEAKER_00]: blood and is strictly a weak base and
lactic acid is the corresponding acid So
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of flips back and forth between
these two The lactic acid aids your
[SPEAKER_00]: muscles as an energy source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can actually help reduce the acidity
Again, this kind of binding of these
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen ions to produce again the lactic
acid here can actually be beneficial at
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing potentially the burning muscle
feeling contrary to popular belief You may
[SPEAKER_00]: experience the day after muscle burn known
as delayed onset muscle soreness This day
[SPEAKER_00]: after the day after you exercise you feel
kind of that burning achy feeling in your
[SPEAKER_00]: muscles It's likely due to microscopic
tears in your muscles and or irritation of
[SPEAKER_00]: pain receptors during the exercising
process However, believe it or not this
[SPEAKER_00]: process is actually not well understood So
you kind of get up in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have that kind of soreness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be in part due to these torn
muscles But likely not to the lactic acid
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure, but again that acid that's
breaking those ATPs That's your cause so
[SPEAKER_00]: it is an acid simply put don't blame
lactic acid
