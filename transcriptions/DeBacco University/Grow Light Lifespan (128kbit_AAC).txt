[SPEAKER_00]: Now some may consider the grow weight
lifespan is from when they buy it and
[SPEAKER_00]: first install it to when it completely
explodes and dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may not always be the case because it
will degrade over time so the lifespan may
[SPEAKER_00]: be related to how much efficiency can you
tolerate or how much loss of efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: can you tolerate before you throw that
bulb out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that usable life, and I put that life
in quotes there, some lights may continue
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce light but overall plant
production may suffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top growers will change out bulbs when
productivity will suffer, which is well
[SPEAKER_00]: before they actually burn out or quote
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to consider that
lifespan is that light bulb is degrading
[SPEAKER_00]: over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much degradation are you willing to
tolerate before you change it out?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times they state bulbs in the
amount of hours that they can run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important just to have a quick
little conversions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one year is 8,760 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Running at 18 hour days, you're looking at
one calendar year will be 6,570 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running a flowering phase which
is 12 hour days, you're looking at 4,380
[SPEAKER_00]: hours is what your bulb will accumulate
over the course of a calendar year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the mounting position does impact the
lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light bulb's operating position
affects its lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bulbs will last longer when they're
operated in a vertical up and down
[SPEAKER_00]: position.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the same 20,000 hour light bulb is
operated in a horizontal or side to side
[SPEAKER_00]: position, it'll only last about 15,000
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while they will last longer in the
vertical position, keep in mind you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: quite getting the efficiency out of them
from the plant standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Percent of light output determines its
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much below new, which would be 100%,
are you or the manufacturer considering to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the life?
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% broken down, 75, 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really is no standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to develop what percentage you
determine that life to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gives you the common bulb types
in the rated life.
[SPEAKER_00]: High pressure sodium is about 5,000 hours
and that'll be about 95%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going to depend on
specifically the bulb manufacturer that
[SPEAKER_00]: you choose to go with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metal halides last about 9,000 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: T5 for lessens last about 20,000 hours and
they'll still be about 85% efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cimeric metal halides are about 20,000
hours also, but they will be running at
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% efficiency at that 20,000 hour mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plasmas last about 40,000 hours and LEDs
are about 50,000 hours but still
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining 90%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So LEDs, it's kind of important there that
look at high pressure sodium is only 5,000
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to 50,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 10 times as long for the LED for only a
5% more degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So high pressure sodium is 5,000 hours and
that'll still be 95% efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs, 50,000 hours and still operating at
90% efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, cost comes into play,
the spectrum that they're producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember T5 for lessens is not good for
flowering, it's a lack of penetration,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they can last a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very important to keep an idea what the
rated life is depending on what light
[SPEAKER_00]: source that you use because that may
impact the cost over the long term.
