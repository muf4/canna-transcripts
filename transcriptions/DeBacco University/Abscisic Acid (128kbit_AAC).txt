[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to provide a brief overview
of the plant hormone abscisic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're wondering what this is pictured
here, this is an open and a closed stomata
[SPEAKER_00]: that's involved in this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So abscisic acid, typically abbreviated
ABA, is kind of incorrectly named because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not related to abscission.
[SPEAKER_00]: It slows plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you see abscisic acid,
please don't confuse it with abscission
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is not involved in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important in drought stress and other
stresses, it's particularly important for
[SPEAKER_00]: causes the stomata to close.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see our target guard cells here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we add ABA or abscisic acid,
it can cause cells to become flaccid,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly the guard cells here,
and the stomata to close.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when plants want to help decrease their
water loss, abscisic acid can be a hormone
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be activated to help close the
stomata of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, abscisic acid prevents seeds
from germinating while they're still on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant doesn't want to have its seed
germinate before it falls, so the ground
[SPEAKER_00]: can kind of grow and prosper there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So abscisic acid is involved in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also involved in suppressing seeds
from germinating even when off the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, apple seeds have a very high
amount of abscisic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes them years naturally to be able
to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because of their high abscisic acid
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Abscisic acid also changes gene expression
patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's considered an inhibitory hormone
because it can block the effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: auxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind we have a lot of these
hormones that are interacting with one
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Abscisic acid is one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an inhibitory hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can actually suppress or block the
effects of auxins in the plant.
