[SPEAKER_00]: You may remember a while back talking
about mitochondria, and the fact that they
[SPEAKER_00]: do contain some of their own DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're talking about inheritance,
inheriting genes, which is DNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got to touch on the mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't forget about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it may not be a large portion of DNA
that we get from mitochondria,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is still a portion, and that must be
taken into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So exochromosoma, or mitochondrial
inheritance, some genes are actually in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: All mitochondrial genes are transmitted
only by the mother, meaning all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondria that you've received come
from your mother, come from the female
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unusual muscle disorders and neurological
problems have been linked to these
[SPEAKER_00]: particular genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this means if the mother's affected,
all of the children will be affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the father's affected, all of the
children will be unaffected because you
[SPEAKER_00]: get your mitochondria from your mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of this, if the mitochondria
come from mom, even though you get all of
[SPEAKER_00]: your mitochondria from your mom,
you may not always get a mutated
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how is this possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of revolves the dice here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of rolled the dice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what percentage of
mitochondria mom has of her mutated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at this as kind of a good
summary here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our mitochondria and our
mother, the mother with no symptoms,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we have some mutated mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the number of mitochondria,
well, some of those are transferred into
[SPEAKER_00]: the mature egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're unlucky, then you get a high
percentage of the mutated ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get up to 80% of mutated mitochondria
in the egg, which will result in the
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring having that percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're a little luckier,
you get half and half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you've been a little bit more lucky,
you only get kind of 20% of mutated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sperm contributes no mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only comes from the mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a child with severe disease,
potentially if there's 80% mutated,
[SPEAKER_00]: a child with a mild disease if it's 50%,
or a child with no disease or very little
[SPEAKER_00]: signs of disease if only 20% are mutated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how 20% mean mitochondria for
mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you like your odds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning, it depends on which ones you get
of those 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get some that are all 100%
clean, or in this case, you get 80% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mutated ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where luck or unluck the draw
comes into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of your mitochondria, good,
bad, or indifferent, you can blame your
[SPEAKER_00]: mother for that.
