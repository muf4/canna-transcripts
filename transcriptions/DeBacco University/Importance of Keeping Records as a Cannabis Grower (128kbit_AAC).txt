[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video
looking at the importance of keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: records as a cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while this may not be the most
entertaining or flashiest of videos,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a very important one that a lot of
growers will often overlook and only
[SPEAKER_00]: realize at the end of a grow or looking
back that they wish they put a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more time into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this video will prevent you
from making that mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, as I said, often missed by
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers are not sure why this seems to be
a consistent problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more often than not, growers do not
document what they do or keep records in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at record keeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be very simple or it could be
very complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really matter in the sense that
you're getting in the pattern of taking at
[SPEAKER_00]: least some sort of records.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be simply when you water,
how much you water, when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizing, what you're fertilizing with,
some sort of calendar system, just some
[SPEAKER_00]: way to be able to look back at what you
did to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is applicable to all growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there can be different levels of
record keeping depending on growing
[SPEAKER_00]: situation specifics, all growers must have
some method for documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is true if you're an indoor
grower, mainly growing one or two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an indoor grower, growing a
large number, hundreds or thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even if you're an outdoor grower,
all of these growers this applies to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people think, oh, I'm going to
grow in one or two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely want to be documenting and
keeping track of what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why you want to do this is
the data is really key to overall success
[SPEAKER_00]: because knowing what you did is important
for refining a growing plan or to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: what may have gone wrong with a growth
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also works if something went right,
you have a good track record of what you
[SPEAKER_00]: did to try to repeat that same success and
maybe even refine your tactics even a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, data is key to success and
documenting that data is also important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of growers will ask, well,
what should I be documenting?
[SPEAKER_00]: What should I be looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then these are just some basic
suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the basics of your growing
area, the size of your growing area,
[SPEAKER_00]: the number of plants, the type of plants,
starting materials, seeds or clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds, temperature and humidity
levels, as well as the materials you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using, what media, containers,
ventilation, lights are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole plethora more you could
add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Key dates such as when you start or
flowering dates or harvest dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are like the key main three there
with cannabis production, water usage,
[SPEAKER_00]: the frequency and amount related to plant
age, fertilizers added and the mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios that you applied them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What fertilizers and what dilution rate
did you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you may be changing that over the
growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also pest pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: When and what was seen and documented and
how did you potentially go about trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: control that and how effective was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: For those that are breeding, an extra
level of detail needs to be included,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at morphological and plant
specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important for tracking traits from
one generation to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it more of a broad leaf squat of your
appearance with short internodes or is it
[SPEAKER_00]: more of a taller growing plant with more
thinner leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all important considerations to
be documenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, regardless of what grower you
are, what level you're at, everyone should
[SPEAKER_00]: be taking and collecting data with their
grow so they can continue to improve their
[SPEAKER_00]: ability as growers of cannabis in general.
