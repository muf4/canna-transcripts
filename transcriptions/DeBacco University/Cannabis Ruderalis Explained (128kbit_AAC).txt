[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another Tobacco University
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be exploring Cannabis
rudalis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give you a little bit of explanation of
what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be more familiar with it under its
other name of like an auto flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's referring to the rudalis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to explain a little bit of
what makes this plant unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have the picture of the numbers of
the calendar above me because this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it initially unique is that it's not
photoperiod dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based on number of growing days until
when it flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the origin of rudalis is in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's thought to be native to areas in Asia
or central kind of Eastern Europe and
[SPEAKER_00]: Russia regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rudalis is believed to be descendant of
the Indica genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, originally Cannabis rudalis was
considered to be a wild breed of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're learning more about the
classification and actually where it may
[SPEAKER_00]: have originated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rudalis is based on its northern regions
of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had to adjust to harsh climates in the
shorter growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been brought indoors and influenced
by new hybrid varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also being utilized to be bred
into other varieties because a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: growers really prefer that auto flower
trait, that going into flower based on
[SPEAKER_00]: number of days and not based on duration
of light exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant morphology of the rudalis or
the auto flowers, it can be short,
[SPEAKER_00]: about one to three feet tall, thick,
sturdy stems, shaggy kind of growth
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they automatically flower after about
21 to 30 days of vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this will depend, of course,
on the exact strain that you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're harvested in about 70 to 110 days
from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that will depend on the actual
strain you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the buds do tend to be smaller,
but well supported by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, with everything, there are pros
and cons associated with whatever plant
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology you're choosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the common cultivation locations for
rudalis or auto flowers, and the key is
[SPEAKER_00]: that they flower based on days old and not
the photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're commonly referred to,
as I said, auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're used usually in late plantings in
outdoor locations, simply due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: natural changing of the photo periods that
may flip a plant in the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: prematurely.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not dependent on the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their small size makes them great for
indoor called tent locations, as we can
[SPEAKER_00]: see here, grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And due to the general popularity,
breeders are utilizing these plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: cross with some other high potency options
to create kind of the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just keep in mind with these auto
flowers, because you're limited on the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of days, it's a set number of days,
you want to make sure you're handling
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants that you're maximizing every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a regular photo period dependent,
if there was a day that you quote missed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could simply delay that flip to that
flower photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: With these, it's based on days old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So utilizing everything you can to
maximize that plant growth from day one is
[SPEAKER_00]: very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make sure they're not deficient in
anything, utilizing CO2 if you're in an
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor grow operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these things to intriguing the most
out of each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just, there are many cultivars being
used and bred with these, so these are
[SPEAKER_00]: just two listed and there's many more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Rudalis is that auto flower trait and
it can be high in CBD as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want something that's a little
bit easier that you don't have to worry
[SPEAKER_00]: about photo period, Rudalis or auto
flowers might be worth investigating,
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporating as part of your plants that
you may grow.
