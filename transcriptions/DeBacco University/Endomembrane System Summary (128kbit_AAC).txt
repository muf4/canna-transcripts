[SPEAKER_00]: Now you might be looking at this image
going, how can this be a summary of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endomembrane system?
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks very complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a lot of things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to attempt to kind of go over
the main points.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see a theme here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start in the nucleus and we kind of
work our way through the rough and smooth
[SPEAKER_00]: ER.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have transport vesicles that then go to
the Golgi, ultimately forming these
[SPEAKER_00]: vesicles that will then leave the cell in
this example here or enter the cell in
[SPEAKER_00]: this regards where we're having enzymes
break some of those things down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this whole system is just a way that
the nucleus containing its DNA can help
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate process for things being secreted
from the cell or things being broken down
[SPEAKER_00]: that enter the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's now look into a little more
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, here's that nucleus starting
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our rough ER forming those
vesicles going to our Golgi and going to
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very simplified version of what
we just saw in the previous image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a little bit more complex with all
the parts labeled and broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our nuclear membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our pores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, those are regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our rough ER, our smooth ER.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these vesicles being attached,
these vesicles being released and going
[SPEAKER_00]: through this modification process through
the Golgi, which is located in this
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have things entering on one side of the
Golgi, exiting out the other, and
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately going to come in contact in
this case with the cell membrane and then
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be secreted outside to the
exterior environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just kind of gives you a little
bit of a breakdown of the different
[SPEAKER_00]: components involved with this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the ER and the Golgi are going to be
two years we're going to spend a little
[SPEAKER_00]: time with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a modification of proteins and
lipids as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our rough ER.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's our Golgi.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to receive vesicles from the
ER and the cis or interface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Golgi is going to receive those
transport vesicles from our rough ER and
[SPEAKER_00]: the cis face here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have some carbohydrates being
added and taking place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this kind of packaging and
processing of these vesicles and prepares
[SPEAKER_00]: them for shipment out to vesicles and
other trans or outer face here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of have this kind of process
here, which I won't go into the great
[SPEAKER_00]: detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Golgi where it's packaging and
processing these proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: These vesicles ultimately containing the
processed proteins will bud off and in
[SPEAKER_00]: this example are going to the be attached
to the exterior of the cell on the plasma
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Golgi apparatus is a series of
flattened membrane components called
[SPEAKER_00]: cisternae or sacs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cis is the near the ER and fuses with
the ER vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember ER is referring to endoplasmic
reticulum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medial is the middle components and
then the trans is where it buds off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this example, the nucleus would be
about where I'm located and then enter the
[SPEAKER_00]: cis face, go through its modification and
then exit out the trans face here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the summary of the Golgi, again the
shipping and receiving center for cellular
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many transport vesicles from the ER travel
to the Golgi apparatus for modification.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a center of manufacture, storing and
shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: These flattened membrane sacs look like a
pack of pita bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very high surface area to volume
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Golgi stores and packages materials
for transport vesicles to be released
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the cell or to kind of move to
a different location.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Golgi apparatus itself in action here,
we can kind of see the budding off and in
[SPEAKER_00]: this case kind of the exiting out of the
cell or here we're kind of having this
[SPEAKER_00]: receiving end here, this binding or this
membrane kind of binding that's occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, many different end results but
the same basic process where we're having
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of budding off and this kind of
vesicles formed for transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we also have lysosomes which are
vesicles containing digestive enzymes that
[SPEAKER_00]: break down food and foreign particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're membrane bound vesicles but
they're not found in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are produced by the Golgi apparatus
and they can contain powerful digestive
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes that are highly acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we think about acidic, we think
about our lemons being very acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's helping the breakdown process,
the digestion of large molecules into
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller ones or breaking down or recycling
cellular resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apoptosis, programmed cell death,
is like a tadpole losing its tail,
[SPEAKER_00]: also kind of involved with this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some genetic diseases of
lysosomes, Tay-Sachs disease in particular
[SPEAKER_00]: is caused by a defect in lysosomal
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do have more components than
simply just containing proteins or
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This endomembrane system summary,
those proteins produced in the rough ER
[SPEAKER_00]: and lipids from the smooth ER are carried
to the Golgi apparatus and then the Golgi
[SPEAKER_00]: modifies those and kind of like finalizes
them, packages them into vesicles and then
[SPEAKER_00]: allows them to carry on to their final
destination.
[SPEAKER_00]: These secretory vesicles carry out
products to the membrane where exocytosis
[SPEAKER_00]: produces secretions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lysosomes fuse with the incoming vesicles
and digest those macromolecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our endomembrane system, kind of that
visual summary, kind of taking me back to
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those previous images that I showed
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the reason why everything is
kind of stacked and organized the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: it is, is to allow for efficient
transportation of our DNA going to our
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins being made in the ribosomes on
the rough ER, modified with some lipids
[SPEAKER_00]: from the smooth ER, kind of finally
packaged and processed in the Golgi,
[SPEAKER_00]: released in vesicles to their final
location.
