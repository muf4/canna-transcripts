[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to go over calculating the size
[SPEAKER_00]: of an indoor cannabis operation and give
you some numbers to kind of look at and
[SPEAKER_00]: compare maybe to your own operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at designing one from
scratch, some ideas to take into
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's sharpen those pencils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to calculating the size of an
indoor grow operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, when we're calculating size
here, it's important to know how many
[SPEAKER_00]: full-sized plants you can take care of
just because you can fit them in an area,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly for a grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't take care of them,
there will be an overall loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to factor in also have an idea
what your labor may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, size available and limiting
amount of light coverage are all factors
[SPEAKER_00]: into potential size of an indoor
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll go over some of the specifics to
lighting in particular at the very end
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's square foot recommendations,
and I stress these are just general
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations, good starting points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the plant morphology of your
chosen cannabis strain, this will impact
[SPEAKER_00]: the overall size of each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, your pruning method will also have a
great impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that Sea of Green will have the most
plants per square foot due to the shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: veg cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in general for full-sized
flowering plants, one plant per five
[SPEAKER_00]: square feet or two plants per square meter
is the typical kind of general starting
[SPEAKER_00]: point for a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at plants per 10 square
feet or that one square meter per growth
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while I quoted two plants, that beats
for the flowering room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at propagation in that
same 10 square feet or square meter,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get potentially over 150 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a vegetative room, you want to
decrease from 150 all the way down to
[SPEAKER_00]: about three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they make that final change to
that flower room, that's where you'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing those two plants per square
meter or per 10 square feet, depending
[SPEAKER_00]: what system you're using for measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these also other limitations to
consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, the labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you can fit them all there,
can you take care of them all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have the time to dedicate to all
those plants that are going to need
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout their entire growth cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the lighting that I'll
mention in the next slide and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: circuits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you can put 10 lights,
does your electrical system support or can
[SPEAKER_00]: it support 10 lights that you're choosing
to utilize in that area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I said the lights tend to be the most
limiting, so I want to give you just some
[SPEAKER_00]: general ideas as far as what lighting
should be used for what.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as general rules, if you have a
thousand watt HPS or high pressure sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: that we see and see right here,
about a five by five foot for flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: plant or a six by six square foot area for
a veg plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we're measuring out those
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: 600 watt HPS, we see the measurements
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: CMH, ceramic metal halide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see that very similar to the high
pressure sodium as far as square footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 615 CMH goes down a four by four feet
for veg and only three by three for
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 650 watt LED, kind of similar to that
thousand watt HPS, but be mindful because
[SPEAKER_00]: these are just meant to be general
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be getting the same potential
output as you would with a thousand watt
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's say a 420 LED, you could see the
listed out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also going to impact when we talk
about electricity, the amount of cooling
[SPEAKER_00]: that you may need, because if you are
using kind of the HPS, it will generate a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more heat than say an LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: LED lights still generate heat,
but just not quite as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also take that into factor and
consideration on how you might be moving
[SPEAKER_00]: plants from potentially one type of light
to another throughout their growth cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: and how that will impact things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, there are a lot of variables,
but it's important to understand some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those before you go out and start
purchasing anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can make educated decisions and not
have to rebuy things and help increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: odds of success of your growing operation.
