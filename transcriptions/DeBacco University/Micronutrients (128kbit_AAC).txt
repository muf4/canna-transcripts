[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here we're going to look at
micronutrients, sometimes called trace
[SPEAKER_00]: elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind micronutrients are essential
for plant growth, but just needed in small
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the first one here,
boron, represented by the letter B,
[SPEAKER_00]: this helps in the use of nutrients and
regulates other nutrients also.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example would be calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So calcium and boron levels are often
compared to one another because boron can
[SPEAKER_00]: influence the amount of availability of
calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essential for seed and fruit
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deficiencies are encouraged if plants are
water stressed and the humidity is very
[SPEAKER_00]: low, also if soil or media calcium levels
are low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Borax or boric acid are common sources of
boron if you're looking at supplementing
[SPEAKER_00]: them to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chloride is often considered to be a soil
contaminant, and at high levels this is
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chloride, though, is needed by plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of considered a soil contaminant
because it's a negative ion, and it kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of influenced some of the availability of
some cations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is needed at least in these kind of
micronutrient amounts because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: important to help regulate the stomata,
which are areas below the leaves that help
[SPEAKER_00]: air come in and out and also regulate
water, and it helps the plant balance its
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction with the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also necessary for the photosynthetic
process to allow that to function
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, in these high amounts,
not the best thing, but it is needed in
[SPEAKER_00]: some amounts by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copper is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's required for many enzymatic
activities in plants and for chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_00]: and seed production, all very vital tasks
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A most common cause for deficiency is a pH
imbalance and not a lack of copper in the
[SPEAKER_00]: media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, again, why I stress that it's
important to be monitoring and knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: what your pH is because this is one
micronutrient in particular that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: drastically affected by swings in pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to pay special attention to the
leaves around the buds or tips that are
[SPEAKER_00]: turning yellow and lower parts of the
leaves getting a darker than normal green
[SPEAKER_00]: color.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be evidence of a copper
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's of concern for cannabis in particular
because it can stunt bud formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you stunt bud formation, that's kind of
where all the main driving cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: production is, and if that gets stunted
because of low copper, that can really
[SPEAKER_00]: impact your final harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going on to iron here, represented by the
FE, it's involved in the formation of
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes and chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves will yellow if deficient,
but will typically be the upper leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the lower ones like nitrogen or a
magnesium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of a citrus plant that
kind of gets the idea that it's the upper
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves that are yellowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron typically used, you know,
a lot in greenhouses, infrastructural
[SPEAKER_00]: support, but it is also a nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a common problem with coco coir
simply because of some of the properties
[SPEAKER_00]: of this particular media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manganese, again, not to be confused with
magnesium, this is manganese, represented
[SPEAKER_00]: by MN, functions with enzyme systems
involved with the breakdown of
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrates, nitrogen metabolism,
and photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here's a fertilizer here,
corrects the frizzle leaf in palms,
[SPEAKER_00]: so commonly a palm tree fertilizer for
whatever reason, but manganese is needed
[SPEAKER_00]: by all plants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molybdenum is needed in such small
amounts, it's very unlikely to be the case
[SPEAKER_00]: of a deficiency in most instances.
[SPEAKER_00]: If growing in a purely hydroponic
situation, there may be a chance of this
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring, but manganese fertilizer
contains some level of molybdenum,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not needed in large amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the picture here of a thimble
because it's like, to grow an acre of
[SPEAKER_00]: corn, you need like a thimble full amount
of molybdenum for the entire acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, when I say small amounts,
very small amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this is what the actual element
looks like, the fertilizer form is not the
[SPEAKER_00]: pure element to be in a molecule complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last one we're gonna look at here is
zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a common occurrence in cannabis,
but where it does occur can be a major
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very mobile, so you're likely to
find the symptoms show up in newer growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really translocate through the
plant very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this, it can be an issue if
you're cloning a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the cutting is taken towards the
end, this zinc may have a hard time
[SPEAKER_00]: getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take recent clones, and they all
turn yellow fairly quickly, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance you could be zinc deficient in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mention this just because if you're
looking at kind of feeding the pickling
[SPEAKER_00]: mother plants, you wanna make sure that
they're healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If zinc is an issue in the media you've
been growing in, something to keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind, especially if you're looking to
clone that plant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you'll be removing that tip,
and you wanna make sure that it maintains
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice green coloration so that it can
absorb light and produce quality roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: allow you to have the next generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, one that's not a major concern,
but if you're having problems with your
[SPEAKER_00]: clones, one you may wanna investigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
week.
Bye.
Thanks for watching.
