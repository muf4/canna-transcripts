[SPEAKER_00]: OK, here we're going to learn a little bit
more about the DNA molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see on this side the characteristic
double helix shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as we progress to here,
we see our nucleotides binding together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that this is a DNA molecule
because of presence of thiamine,
[SPEAKER_00]: thiamine adenine, guanine cytosine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to focus a little bit more
on the specific binding that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you will notice arrows going from 5
down to 3 prime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here from, again, 5 prime pointing to
3 prime.
[SPEAKER_00]: One pointing down, one pointing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where DNA gets the term
anti-parallel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk more about that when we do DNA
replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to the double helix molecule,
what's holding these two strands together
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually hydrogen bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hydrogen bonds between thiamine and
adenine are two hydrogen bonds holding
[SPEAKER_00]: those nucleotides together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nucleotides guanine and cytosine are
held together by three bonds, three
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen bonds in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all two bonds is strong enough to hold
the two strands together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, three bonds are stronger than
two bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way to kind of remember this is C has this
curve shape as does G.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a similar curve shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, they bind tighter and stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's three hydrogen bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And T, remember, only has two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that depicted here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These hydrogen bonds hold the bases
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where there's a thiamine and adenine,
we see two bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where there's a cytosine and guanine,
we see three bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind we can identify this as DNA
because of the presence of thiamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these hydrogen bonds are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the hydrogen bonds are biology's
weak bond, it's a good thing that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes it very easy to unzip the double
helix for replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also for reading different genes that we
want to replicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it allows for an easy rezip to
kind of store and keep our double helix,
[SPEAKER_00]: our DNA structure together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important that it doesn't fall
apart because it is the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: information So we want these hydrogen
bonds to kind of allow to open up a
[SPEAKER_00]: section of DNA to recopy or read a gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we want them to kind of reseal up
so that we don't lose our DNA structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now copying and replicating DNA,
there's two strands of DNA helix are
[SPEAKER_00]: complementary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that does not mean they're
identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: One becomes a template of the other and
each can be a template to replicate the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean is where we have a G,
there'll be a C down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A C to a G, an A to a U because in this
case we are making an RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why we call them not
identical is it's complementary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what does G bind with a C?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does C bind with a G?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's called a complementary
strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a template strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is binding here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, so this is a double
helix of RNA because we see two uracils
[SPEAKER_00]: with no thiamine present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an interesting note is that the ratio
of A to T and G to C affects the stability
[SPEAKER_00]: of the DNA molecule as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two bonds versus three bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A to T remember has two bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: G to C has three bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: For biotech procedures, the more G to C
bonds, the higher the temperature is
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to separate out the strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we talk about DNA and separating out a
double helix strand here, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: G and C bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be more or higher
temperature required to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: separate that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many organisms that can withstand high
temperatures have many G to C bonds within
[SPEAKER_00]: their DNA molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly here, when does our DNA replicate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it replicates when our cells go to
reproduce to produce identical copies here
[SPEAKER_00]: in the case of mitosis and gamete
production, the production of sperm or egg
[SPEAKER_00]: or pollen grains through the process of
meiosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is when we particularly want to
break those bonds to kind of reformulate,
[SPEAKER_00]: to carry on that genetic information to
the next generation, whether it be through
[SPEAKER_00]: gametes, through the process here of
pollen or sperm cells or egg cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: or producing identical copies of our
cells.
Thank you.
