[SPEAKER_00]: So in this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to walk you through step by step
[SPEAKER_00]: how I go about setting up a ventilation
system for a cannabis grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you may have figured out, this is a
little bit of a longer video, but I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go over how to set up a
ventilation system for cannabis grow tent
[SPEAKER_00]: in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the structure of this video,
despite its length, is I'm going to show
[SPEAKER_00]: you the setup starting with the intake and
following the path air would take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifics of the design will be covered to
help maximize airflow in the tent while
[SPEAKER_00]: also minimizing the potential for plant
odors to escape the growing environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to adjust airflow with the use of
speed control valves will be shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, specific products used in the
video will be highlighted to allow for an
[SPEAKER_00]: easy replication of the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the basics kind of equipment that I
will be using can seem to be twice there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go over the intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show you a HEPA filter and
inline fan with a speed control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show you some ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: For exhaust, we have a pre-filter carbon
filter, more ducting and inline fan
[SPEAKER_00]: followed by exhaust end ducting to another
carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So enjoy the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go through step by step in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you make it to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in an effort to take you through the
path of air, we have the air first coming
[SPEAKER_00]: in here with our shroom filter,
our HEPA filter, going through our first
[SPEAKER_00]: fan and going through this six inch
tubing, going right into the bottom of the
fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We come around the bottom of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we come around the bottom of the tent,
you can see here, this is the air it's
[SPEAKER_00]: actively getting added in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is adding air at the lower point,
right above our reservoir for our flood
[SPEAKER_00]: and drain table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as the air kind of gets mixed
throughout, we'll have some plants growing
[SPEAKER_00]: here, fan for circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very top here, you can notice we have
our first carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a six inch by 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: That air is going to come up through here
and work its way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pulled through this other fan,
this other inline fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our fan, going to come out the fan
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our continued air ducting,
six inches running down the side only
[SPEAKER_00]: because I wanted to run it through yet
another carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have another carbon filter right
here and that is ultimately going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: out any potential odors before they get
into the room here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a quick flow of a great example of
a high-end ventilation system that also
[SPEAKER_00]: will remove any cannabis odors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so what you're going to see here is
I'm going to go through this four by two
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tent, the ventilation system,
because we know it's important for plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to have air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we're in a grow tent,
we want to be isolating that air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this not only is going to add air to
the environment, we're going to see a
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon filter that's going to help filter
that air so there'll be no odors leaving
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow tent here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important that when we seal this
structure, we have a way to get air in and
[SPEAKER_00]: a way to get air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here we have a hyperfan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a stealth hyperfan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Picture right here, the actual fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's great about this fan is it's called
a hyper stealth fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets that name because it runs very
quietly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fan itself is very small, but what
ends up happening is there is a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: foam.
[SPEAKER_00]: That foam acts as a way to cancel out a
lot of noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here in a lab room now that people
share, so we want to make sure it's as
[SPEAKER_00]: quiet as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have fans in this area
with a lot of foam.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to take air in here and go
through and add it to the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we don't want to leave this area
on the top open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to prevent anything from getting into
our fan, into our grow tent, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: something here called like a HEPA filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called a dust shroom to be
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's really great about this is it
easily fits right on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way to kind of filter out any
particulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at our fan here.
[SPEAKER_00]: To open up here, it's going to be the
intake and it's going to send the air down
[SPEAKER_00]: this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to just leave this open to
the air for multiple reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, we don't want anything to fall in
there, but two, we don't want anything to
[SPEAKER_00]: get into the fan to damage it or into the
grow tent itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they make these little nice little
filters here, these little HEPA filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is particularly called a dust shroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will go right on top of our fan motor
here in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a six inch fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got the six inch dust shroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes it really easy is the
installation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally it just looks like a little
mushroom there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will literally just go, basically sit
right on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while that's really easy to do,
it's a vital component of this ventilation
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've got the cord here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to plug the stealth hyper fan
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to hear it spool up
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the excellent thing about these
hyper fans is they also have a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: control them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a way to regulate exactly how
much air flow is here, is going through
[SPEAKER_00]: this fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we look at the fan here,
we see that there is a speed control that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes with this fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this stealth hyper fan, what's great,
has its own little speed control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see how those adjustments
come into play in just a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, we do have the top here with
our HEPA filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is filtering any air that comes
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air flow through here is going down
through the fan, which it is running right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to come down through the
tubing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's ultimately going to go into our
grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see that intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in this grow tent, this is a four by
two grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a flood and drain table here and
that intake that we saw with the air comes
[SPEAKER_00]: in just above the reservoir there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look down, we can see the
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the flood and drain table right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that tubing that's located right there
is actively adding air to the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, it's important for air
circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great way to kind of go
through the adding air into the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also now for adding air,
we're going to need a way to exhaust air
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're going to see the exhaust phase
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as shown before, that's our intake down
by the water reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the flood and drain table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we work our way up, here's our four
by two grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now going to focus our attention at
the top of the structure here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's immediately in our view right
here is a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's got a covering over it to help
any particulate, but underneath that is
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual carbon component.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why the carbon filter is
mounted here towards the top is you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to remove the hot air as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're adding air at the bottom and
we're going to be removing the top warmer
[SPEAKER_00]: air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been a PVC pipe installed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some of these light adjusting
hooks here to help keep this as high as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible, but still allowing some kind of
clearance at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we're noticing here is we have
just a little pre-filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they come with pre-filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can wash them, but always good to have
an extra on hand just in case you tear it
[SPEAKER_00]: or something goes wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chiefs are easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're easy to store and they're very
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the pre-filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's below that is our actual carbon
filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one I've chosen here is kind of an
oversized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an activated carbon filter made by
the company FAT.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's designed for 500 cubic feet per
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this filter is sitting basically right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see another one of them in
a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this is doing now is we're going to
have a fan on the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to pull air through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any air that has any odor with it or
the warmest air is going to come through
[SPEAKER_00]: this activated carbon filter, be removed
from particulate, which will help the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon last a little bit longer,
remove of odor, and then go through the
[SPEAKER_00]: fan, which is our next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So continuing on with our ventilation
system, here's our carbon filter pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: out the hottest air and deodorizing it as
it goes through those activated carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes right through another one
of those stealth hyper fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why another stealth hyper
fan is right here is to help move air
[SPEAKER_00]: through here and out of the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we don't see anything in the branding
here because of the way I had to mount it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we can see it's mounted high and this
is kind of the size of the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all of that sound canceling foam
installed in there, which really does a
[SPEAKER_00]: great job of reducing any noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned before the one on the outside
has got a speed control, which I have
[SPEAKER_00]: installed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one could have the same option,
but I choose not to run a speed control.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I choose not to run a speed
control is this is very restrictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulling it through this carbon filter,
it's got to exhaust through another carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I run this one at 100% and I adjust the
one on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's continue a little bit further
with this ventilation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, as we follow that air, if it's been
through one carbon filter and through the
[SPEAKER_00]: fan, it's now coming outside of the grow
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we can follow this down here,
we're starting to see there that air is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming right through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And normally it'd just be exhausted into
the outside environment, but here I've
[SPEAKER_00]: chosen another step.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've chosen actually to run it through
another carbon filter, something you
[SPEAKER_00]: typically won't see, but there's a reason
for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives you a little bit closer
inspection of that carbon filter and how
[SPEAKER_00]: fine all of those little pores are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason why this is run through
another carbon filter is just to help
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure that there's no odor that is
exhausted out of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, as we come down that exhaust air
is coming through here, it's going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: run through another carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this one, unlike the one we saw inside
the grow tent, doesn't have one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-filters on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reason being the air has already been
through the HEPA filter and through the
[SPEAKER_00]: other pre-filter, not really needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do want to run one, I'd run it on
the inside because that would trap any
[SPEAKER_00]: particulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the outside, we want to make sure
it's exhausting as easy as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just another one, a exact same
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the one that we saw on the inside
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those fat filters definitely
oversized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's six inches in neck diameter here by
24 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only do we run it through one,
we ran it through another and air that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes through here, that will then be the
air that goes into the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by running it through two carbon
filters, it really eliminates all sense of
[SPEAKER_00]: odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in a shared space here,
so it's important to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you saw me mention about the speed
control on the fan and how I run the one
[SPEAKER_00]: in the tent at full blast and I adjust the
one on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see how I adjust it and why I
adjust it in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, it's a little bit hard to show on
camera, but I'm going to make an attempt
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have done now is I've got both fans
running and I've got the entire grow tent
[SPEAKER_00]: sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to determine what the right amount of
air circulation is, is you kind of want
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow tent to kind of be flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of want the material not to be
billowing out or pushed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you kind of give a little bit of
pressure on it, you can see it bounces
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a sign that's dialed in and the
air coming in is the same, relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking, as the air going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that main one at the top
running at full speed and I'm adjusting
[SPEAKER_00]: the one on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adjusting how much air comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the correct amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now let me turn that way down and see
how things change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the purposes now, I've basically
turned off the fan on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's blowing just a very minimal amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start to see the side being pushed
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason being the exhaust fan at the
top is still running at full speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's exhausting more air than it's
coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as a result, you can notice it's much
tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of negative pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That air is being pulled out very
aggressively.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of air there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has created a great billowing
effect here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a sign when that air is too
little.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a sign that you want to add some
more air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go to the other extreme and let me
turn the outside one on 100% just like the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside one is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've turned the outside one to 100%
which is not very restrictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be adding more air than
the exhaust fan is going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: take out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this already starting to rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting closer to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's billowing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because we're adding more air than can
be removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can notice that we definitely have
this billowing effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a sign you're adding too much air
aggressively than you are exhausting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's great about a grow tent is it
allows you very quickly to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: assess your air flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little harder in a larger grow space but
this kind of gives you that idea here and
[SPEAKER_00]: now we get the billowing effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go through now and turn it back where
it was at kind of the ideal amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll notice this will kind of come in a
little bit but it's not going to be pushed
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be pushed all the way
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be convex or concave.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be kind of even.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have a little bit of
pressure there just in case there's air
[SPEAKER_00]: flow but not super tight or super loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great way to make sure you're
ventaling your plants properly but also
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling the odors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the fan way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is turning it way up and immediately
be spotting so it's a great little speed
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the grow tent I have here
dialed in it's pretty much right about
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives you that nice kind of way to
quickly be able to assess the speed of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fan to dial in for your grow setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so here I'm just going to go over a
couple of products that we saw today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again I'm not sponsored by any of these
companies but let's go over a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one here is the Hyper Stealth
fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I choose to add not one but
actually two of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well what makes these kind of so great is
that they're very quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're in an area that has a lot
of other people around or if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: running two of them in particular and you
just don't want a lot of disturbance these
[SPEAKER_00]: are a great fan to kind of add.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned the fan is the same Hyper
fan that is sold singly but what makes
[SPEAKER_00]: this so big is that there is a lot of foam
and insulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of kind of area here to help
dampen that noise and it really does a
[SPEAKER_00]: great job even running at full speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned the Hyper fans in addition
also come with these little variable speed
[SPEAKER_00]: controls which are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of other companies have to purchase
them separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great to kind of have come with
it, plug it right in and as you saw in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tent this works quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again these Stealth Hyper fans are
going to pay a little bit more probably
[SPEAKER_00]: for all the extra features that it has but
in my opinion definitely worth it and we
[SPEAKER_00]: saw functioning very well with our grow
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another product you saw downstairs was the
actual carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while this might be a little oversized
everything that you saw was all matched in
[SPEAKER_00]: size appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a six inch by 24 inch carbon
filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hyper fan that we saw also was another
six inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is so great about these carbon
filters is that they really are able to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of reduce any of the odor and we saw
two installed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had one where air was kind of being
pulled through this and then one where air
[SPEAKER_00]: is being kind of exhaust through it with a
Hyper fan in between so that ensured that
[SPEAKER_00]: movement of air was adequate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you never really go too big with one of
these as long as your fans or inline fans
[SPEAKER_00]: are sized appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I chose to go with not only
one that was probably sized appropriately
[SPEAKER_00]: for that tent but I went with two just to
ensure there'd be no chance of any odors
[SPEAKER_00]: escaping that tent while still maintaining
good ventilation for the plants inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these do come with but I do always
purchase separately through a little
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's important you get some of these
because they'll just prevent any
[SPEAKER_00]: particulate from clogging up the very fine
pores of the carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it very fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also important remember with carbon
filters you want to keep your humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of below 75 or 80% because the
moisture in the air will really reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: effectiveness of that fine surface area of
the carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use them appropriately and get them
sized appropriately they can work great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now something else we saw with the grow
tent downstairs was kind of one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: HEPA filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So want to try to maintain and keep your
air as clean as possible coming into the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tent and this is a great way to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these HEPA filters allow that kind of
purification of the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they can be another hassle to add
another filter but what makes these so
[SPEAKER_00]: great is you saw these kind of fall right
on top and they can rest right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They prevent any large particulates from
getting into the fan and they also prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: any fine particulates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be clean and washed
occasionally but well worth it with this
[SPEAKER_00]: one because it's very easily washable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't restrict any of the flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's reusable and again you can see at the
bottom here it is sized appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again we're sticking everything being
six inches with the setup that you just
[SPEAKER_00]: saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this shroom filter here great way to
kind of help ensure air entering but
[SPEAKER_00]: before it enters your grow tent is already
gone through at least one stage of
[SPEAKER_00]: filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to do a quick recap of everything we
saw we started with that HEPA filter here
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing air to get kind of initially
cleaned and purified and preventing
[SPEAKER_00]: anything from getting into our filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fan that we used was a hyperfan
stealth edition so we allowed this to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of help pull the air through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great because it had a speed
control on the outside then ran through
[SPEAKER_00]: some six inch ducting into our tent and
then at the very top of our tent where the
[SPEAKER_00]: air is the hottest we had a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't recognize it keep in mind
that we did have the pre-filter on there
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're always going to get an extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ran through one of these came back through
another hyperfan and then back to another
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon filter on the outside of the tent
to have that double kind of carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: filtration to reduce any chance that
owners would be escaping the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I mentioned to kind of make all
these kind of products come together and
[SPEAKER_00]: work appropriately is that inline kind of
ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get some that is insulated to
make it even more quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part is here watch the edge
because the metal can be quite sharp when
[SPEAKER_00]: you cut it but it doesn't take very much
it can be a very small piece can really
[SPEAKER_00]: expand outwards quite well there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're running it keep in mind
this is going to have a lot of air inside
[SPEAKER_00]: it so that is going to want to expand so
keep in mind that you do want to expand it
[SPEAKER_00]: and then have an idea and cut it to length
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always buy a little bit extra use
it for a couple other things but you saw
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of a nice way to kind of hook and
join everything together and keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: system of air controlled and you want to
try to eliminate as many of the right
[SPEAKER_00]: angles or 180 degree turns as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: The straighter the more efficient with
