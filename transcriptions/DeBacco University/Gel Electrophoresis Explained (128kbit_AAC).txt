[SPEAKER_00]: Here I want to attempt to simplify some of
the complexities associated with gel
[SPEAKER_00]: electrophoresis and explain them to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the basic equipment and setup,
and this is a typical end result that
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see, but how do we go from here to
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have DNA fragments migrate
through a gel, so we are going through a
[SPEAKER_00]: gel, and this gel is going to allow
portions or pieces of DNA to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: move through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the gel electrophoresis is a
procedure that separates out these
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules based on their rate of movement
through the gel and is influenced by an
[SPEAKER_00]: electrical field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that DNA does have a negative
charge to its backbone, allowing this
[SPEAKER_00]: positive-negative charge to be able to
move the fragments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gel electrophoresis is a widely used
technique for analysis of nucleic acids as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give you just a general breakdown
that these BP stands for base pairs,
[SPEAKER_00]: so 1,000 base pairs versus only 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller the base pairs, the smaller
the molecular size, the greater the
[SPEAKER_00]: distance that it can move or travel,
and that's going to be a consistency with
[SPEAKER_00]: the gel electrophoresis process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gel electrophoresis, well,
it requires an agarose gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, agarose gel with electrophoresis is
routinely used in preparation for DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at it under a scanning
electron microscope, it kind of looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it as like a net or a bunch of
little pores through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a polymerase agarose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's porous, allowing for the movement of
DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why the larger fragments kind of
get caught up in this net.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller fragments are able to move
through it much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a linear primal extracted from
seaweed, specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you may think it's got a seaweed
color, it actually ends up being this
[SPEAKER_00]: white kind of thin, small, and fine
powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA is negatively charged, as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when placed in an electrical field,
DNA will migrate towards the positive pole
[SPEAKER_00]: or called the anode.
[SPEAKER_00]: An agarose gel is used to slow the
movement of DNA and is separated by its
[SPEAKER_00]: size, with the smaller fragments moving
further than the larger one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at how fast will the
DNA migrate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends on the size of the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small DNA will move faster than large DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: In electrophoresis, it separates DNA
according to size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are the wells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we initially place the DNA,
and we fill those up with our DNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: which contains small and large fragments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We turn the power on, keeping in mind the
positive on the far end of the gel and the
[SPEAKER_00]: negative over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA with its negative charge will get
pulled towards the positive end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on its size, will separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see an example of the smaller base
pairs of DNA traveling further than the
[SPEAKER_00]: larger base pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within agarose gel, linear DNA migrates
inversely proportional to the log base 10
[SPEAKER_00]: of their molecular weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that simply mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Smaller fragments move further than larger
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to make an agarose gel,
they said the agarose is this white
[SPEAKER_00]: powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's prepared by combining agarose powder
and a buffer solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to have to be heated up to
the point of boiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you also need a flask for boiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The electrophoresis equipment specifically
is going to require a casting tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to seal the edges of the
casting tray, put in the combs,
[SPEAKER_00]: see here, and that's going to be placed on
a level surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of the combs should be touching
the surface of the casting tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: What these combs are going to do is create
little wells that are going to put the DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to give you just an idea, these are
very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what makes this such a an efficient
operation is it can occur on a tabletop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't need a large area to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a power supply, the gel tank,
a casting tray, some power and some combs
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you mix the agarose with the
buffer, they need to boil it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at our agarose and
our buffer solution, we want to combine
[SPEAKER_00]: the agarose powder and buffer solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the flask that is several times larger
than the volume of the buffer because
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll be heating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agarose is insoluble at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you first add it, you're going to
get this kind of like immediate
[SPEAKER_00]: separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the agarose solution is boiled until
it's clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to gently swirl the solution
periodically when heating to allow all the
[SPEAKER_00]: grains of agarose to dissolve well in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful when boiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The agarose solution may become
superheated and may boil violently if been
[SPEAKER_00]: heated for too long, for example,
in a microwave oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be very careful with that
boiling process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once boiled, you want to get some
mitts that actually have some insulation
[SPEAKER_00]: to them because you're going to be pouring
this very hot liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the agarose solution to cool
slightly, but not too much, otherwise it
[SPEAKER_00]: will solidify in the flask.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say cool, it's about 60 degrees
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then carefully pour the melted agarose
solution into the casting tray to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: air bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of the gel combs should be submerged
in the melted agarose solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When cooled, the agarose polymerizes,
forming a flexible gel, should appear
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter in color when completely cooled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will take about half an hour to
45 minutes to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to carefully remove the tape
on the sides and the combs and you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to place the gel in the
electrophoresis chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the advantage of this, you can make
the gel the day before, a couple of days
[SPEAKER_00]: before and hold onto it before you're able
to run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one advantage that maybe you go
through a day of gel making and you go
[SPEAKER_00]: through a day of kind of running through
the analysis portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to add this to the chamber and
you might add enough buffer to cover the
[SPEAKER_00]: gel to a depth of at least one millimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the well is filled with the
buffer solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind that DNA is going to
migrate this way because here's our
[SPEAKER_00]: positive anode and here's our negative
cathode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see our buffer solution in a
series of wells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sample preparation and gel loading.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a six time loading buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have this really dark kind
of blue color.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use glycerol for weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a bromophile blue for color
and you can mix those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to mix the samples of DNA with
the six sample loading buffer with
[SPEAKER_00]: tracking dye.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows the samples to be seen when
loading into the gel and it looks a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: easier and increases the density of the
samples causing them to sink into the gel
[SPEAKER_00]: wells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing you want to do is go
through and load those gel wells and have
[SPEAKER_00]: everything kind of flow and go into the
buffer solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to stay in that well region
because you want to push it or pull it
[SPEAKER_00]: through that gel to allow that separation
to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then with the good pipetting skills,
you want to carefully place the pipette
[SPEAKER_00]: tip over the well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gently expel the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sample should sink into the well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful not to puncture the gel with
the pipette tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: This requires a very steady hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're actually running the gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to place the cover over the
electrophasis chamber, collect the
[SPEAKER_00]: electrical leads, connect the electrical
leads to the power supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure the leads are attached correctly
with the positive and negatives being in
[SPEAKER_00]: the right area because DNA will migrate
towards the red or the anode and the
[SPEAKER_00]: positive in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the power is turned on, bubbles
should form in the electrodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the electrophasis chamber indicating that
you do have a flow of electrical current.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be mindful that that is electrical
hazard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be mindful when that power is
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Running the gel when it's in progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the current is applied, make sure
the gel is running in the correct
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double or triple check this, otherwise you
might lose your entire experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bromethyl blue will run in the same
direction as a DNA and it gives you an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of here's the wells.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that it is moving towards the
anode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is moving through the gel there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is hooked up correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA ladder is also recommended to be added
and inclusion of a DNA ladder,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is basically just sections of known
sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a ladder because it kind of
looks like this nice little rungs of a
[SPEAKER_00]: ladder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it easy to determine the sizes of
unknown DNA fragments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a known defined inclusion of
different base pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows you to compare that to your own
sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note bromethyl blue migrates to
approximately the rate at about 300 base
[SPEAKER_00]: pairs of DNA molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see a little darker band in that
area, it could simply be the bromethyl
[SPEAKER_00]: blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're staining the gel, when a place
of gel in a staining tray containing warm
[SPEAKER_00]: diluted stain, allow the gel to stain for
about 20 to 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow the protocol suggested.
[SPEAKER_00]: To remove excess stain, allow the gel to
de-stain in water for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Replace the water several times for an
efficient de-stain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting a well-defined band
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have many options when you're looking
at gel staining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethidine bromide is one that's probably
used quite extensively because it does
[SPEAKER_00]: bind very efficiently to the DNA and it
fluoresces under UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, be mindful and caution that
gloves should be worn at all times when
[SPEAKER_00]: handling this because it is a powerful
mutagen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will bind to the DNA in the gel and
also the DNA in your hands and your own
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can potentially be a carcinogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, be mindful when handling
bromethyl blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always, always wear gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, there's some safer
alternatives like methyl blue or Bio-Rad
[SPEAKER_00]: makes one or Ward's makes some.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage is that these are
inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a lot less toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't require UV light source,
no hazardous waste disposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not used in some cases because
they can be less sensitive, more DNA is
[SPEAKER_00]: needed on the gel, and longer staining and
de-staining times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the safer alternatives do have
some advantages, but ethidine bromide when
[SPEAKER_00]: used on those kinds of trace samples,
just be mindful as a handler of that
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a gel with ethidine bromide stain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it here placed on a UV light
trans-luminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethidine bromide requires ultraviolet
light to be visualized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now with the UV light off,
you really can't see anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this would be the surface it would be
visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prepare it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we turn the UV light on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, should be wearing
protective glasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are viewing it, you can start to
see some banding developed here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you could take a good image and then
be able to use that for comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visualizing DNA with ethidine bromide is
what a kind of picture would look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the wells, here are the ladders,
and here's the PCR product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Pullen's chain product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Samples one, four, six, and seven were
positive for 500 base pair DNA fragments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could see that listed right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, give you just kind of that idea
of being able to separate DNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: determine if a certain fragment or base
pair length is present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the visualizing the DNA with the
quick view stain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see the same wells, we see the
latter, we see the same PCR product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here one, six, seven, 10,
and 12 were positive for 500 base pair
[SPEAKER_00]: fragments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not ethidine bromide.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, there was sufficient amounts
of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sensitivity wasn't necessarily
required.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could use one of those safer
alternative staining products,
[SPEAKER_00]: and here you can see compared to the gold
standard of ethidine bromide, you'd see a
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching, and we'll see you
next time.
