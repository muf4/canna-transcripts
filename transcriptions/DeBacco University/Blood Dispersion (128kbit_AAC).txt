[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to take a brief overview
of the four main stages of blood
[SPEAKER_00]: dispersion as it comes in contact with the
surface as it gets dispersed and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the steps it goes through between when it
initially is falling to that final result
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll see after.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phase one is contact and collapse and
phase two is the displacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the contact and collapse phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when the droplet first hits the
target surface as you may suspect and the
[SPEAKER_00]: droplet begins to collapse from the bottom
upward.
[SPEAKER_00]: This spot collapses the blood at the
collapsing point is forced outwards
[SPEAKER_00]: creating a rim around the droplet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we can measure for looking at
getting into kind of the measurement of
[SPEAKER_00]: that impact angle if it was on an angle
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: The angle of impact in the target surface
will affect the boundary by determining
[SPEAKER_00]: the nature of the rim and the flow it
falls onto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also to mention is the that target surface
the more porous it is versus the more
[SPEAKER_00]: solid it may be that's going to really
affect how that's going to potentially go
[SPEAKER_00]: through this contact and collapse phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The displacement phase the dimples are
present in the displacement phase may
[SPEAKER_00]: result in the formation of individual
spatter or a spine that could develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see that spines kind of
developing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The target surface influence the formation
of the spines and shape irregularities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's a very smooth surface you might
get really well defined kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: displacement phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a very porous surface it might be
harder for it to kind of see that level of
[SPEAKER_00]: detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dispersion phase is where the blood is
forced into the boundary of the rim and
[SPEAKER_00]: dimples that rise upward and opposite in
the direction of the original momentum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here impacted as coming as coming down
its dispersion kind of coming back up a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The satellite spatter will form to the
greatest extent when the impact angle is
[SPEAKER_00]: closer to 90 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stains striking the target surface at more
acute angle produce wave cast-off spatter
[SPEAKER_00]: where the where the blossom effect occurs
more in the form of a wave on one side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the rim.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just makes sense if you're on more of
an angle you're not going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily this perfectly symmetrical
dispersion phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last one being retractions is the last
phase of development the result from the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect of the surface tension trying to
pull the fluid the stain back into a
[SPEAKER_00]: single form.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have those internal forces there
trying to pull it back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those internal forces present in the
moving fluid are overcome by the surface
[SPEAKER_00]: tension and the liquid reactants forming
spines away from the potential stain.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very acute angle impacts the forces of
inertia overcome the surface tension and
[SPEAKER_00]: satellite spots will detach from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of gives you that very brief
kind of look at as we have the kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: end phase how you'll see it in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how would that form well this is that
dispersion phase and this is that
[SPEAKER_00]: displacement ultimately starting with that
contact phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this helps you hopefully understand a
little bit more of what's going on with
[SPEAKER_00]: blood dispersion because of the properties
internal to the blood.
