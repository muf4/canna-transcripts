[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at the
atomic basics and how they relate to
[SPEAKER_00]: biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we think atomic and we think
basics here, we may be first wondering
[SPEAKER_00]: that how are biology and this is like
chemistry connected?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're kind of bordering along the
lines of what we call biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since biology is a multidisciplinary
science, living organisms are subject to
[SPEAKER_00]: basic laws of physics and also chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this particular lecture,
we're going to dive a little bit into the
[SPEAKER_00]: very small end of chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: These activities sustain life and depend
on the properties of atoms, molecules,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we don't understand kind of what's
going on at the very small level and
[SPEAKER_00]: realize how it can impact us on the very
large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, atoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they made out of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can see here in the center
nucleus, we have our protons and our
[SPEAKER_00]: neutrons and our electrons are on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the same thing here with our protons
and neutrons on the inside and our
[SPEAKER_00]: electrons around that nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So organisms are composed of matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figure I should probably define what
matter is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, matter is anything that takes up
space and has mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be this rock, could be the
plants, could be the building,
[SPEAKER_00]: could be this bird, could be the tree that
this bird is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these are composed of matter
because they take up space and they have
[SPEAKER_00]: mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So properties of matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's physical properties which
are based on observations that do not
[SPEAKER_00]: alter the composition of the matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at properties or
measuring properties of matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: two of those that we could do would be
mass or it's the property of matter that
[SPEAKER_00]: measures its resistance to acceleration or
a general measure of the number of atoms
[SPEAKER_00]: present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another physical property regarding matter
would be volume and it's the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: space an object takes up measured in cubic
units.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think about mass here and just
basically the measure of the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: atoms present and volume is the space that
an object will take up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Density is a measure of mass per volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we kind of relate those two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Density.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here in this graduated cylinder
different liquids of different densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that are more dense will be located
on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that are less dense will be more on
the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we say less dense, those molecules
are spaced out greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we say more dense, there is more mass
per volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic atoms we mentioned before here
are protons and neutrons located in the
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleus and electrons on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this image adds that the others did
not is that the protons have a positive
[SPEAKER_00]: charge, neutrons are neutral, and
electrons have a negative charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Atoms are the smallest unit of matter and
the atoms are made of these protons which
[SPEAKER_00]: are positively charged and they also
determine the atomic number and therefore
[SPEAKER_00]: the element number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to determine the element,
we look at the proton number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neutrons simply have a neutral charge and
are located in the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electrons have a negative one charge and
circle the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically we'll see them kind of labeled
like this with neutrons with a zero here
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating a neutral charge, electrons
with the E with the minus sign indicating
[SPEAKER_00]: a negative charge, and protons with a plus
indicating a positive one charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: An excellent table to kind of go over,
review, and commit to memory would be this
[SPEAKER_00]: one right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you the particle name,
electrons, protons, and neutrons,
[SPEAKER_00]: their location, whether it's in the
orbitals on the outside or located in the
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleus, and the charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where electrons are negative one,
protons positive one, neutrons are neutral
[SPEAKER_00]: or no charge, and the mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protons and neutrons have a mass of one
and electrons we say about zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say about zero because for the intents and
purposes of this class we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider it to be zero, but there is a
very, very small mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's about zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very small, minute number.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our easy math calculations,
we'll pretty much consider it a mass of
[SPEAKER_00]: zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the atomic number and atomic mass,
atoms of various elements different in the
[SPEAKER_00]: subatomic particles, and elements atomic
number is the number of protons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see magnesium has 12 protons,
every oxygen atom will have eight protons,
[SPEAKER_00]: and here hydrogen will have an atomic
number of one, indicating it has one
[SPEAKER_00]: proton in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In its nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers below here we see our average
atomic weights, which we'll talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: The elements atomic mass number is the sum
of protons plus neutrons in the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So referring to atomic weight,
we're adding up the protons and the
[SPEAKER_00]: neutrons since they accompany the vast
majority of the mass of the atom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's an average atomic weight,
which I'll talk about in other lectures.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you get into these decimal
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And international atomic weights here for
all the elements, you can find those
[SPEAKER_00]: easily on the periodic table of elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the atomic number and the atomic mass,
the atomic or mass number is the sum of
[SPEAKER_00]: protons and neutrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And down here we see the atomic number,
which is the protons in a neutral atom.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same as the number of
electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the proton number will not change for
helium, but when we say it's a neutral
[SPEAKER_00]: atom of helium, two of those protons we
know are present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore we need two electrons with their
negative charge to balance out the
[SPEAKER_00]: positive charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Atoms have two regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The electron cloud, which takes up the
most space and is an area where electrons
[SPEAKER_00]: circle the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the outside portion here,
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nucleus is made of protons and
neutrons and determines the atomic mass,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's the center region here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a large positive charge,
because remember our neutrons also located
[SPEAKER_00]: in the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The electrons have a neutral charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This electron cloud often confuses
students, kind of like what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes up the space and atoms circling
the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like this example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The electrons here are the birds,
and the person here in the center is
[SPEAKER_00]: representing the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the electrons, kind of like the birds,
are kind of centered around this nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those birds will be found around
that person or representing the nucleus,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there will always be a few here to the
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of looking at a density standpoint,
we see a more dense located here and less
[SPEAKER_00]: dense to the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we call this an electron
cloud, because it's not really
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly set orbitals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of this cloud region.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of see this darker shading or
more dense located around the nucleus and
[SPEAKER_00]: less dense around the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matter is made up of elements,
and an element is a substance that cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: be broken down to other substances by
chemical reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here just generic elements all
listed here, being combined and broken
[SPEAKER_00]: apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most basic unit here is our elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to refer to and study more
the Pyrrhic table of elements,
[SPEAKER_00]: but hopefully this gave you just a
general, basic overview of atoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
