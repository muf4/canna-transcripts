[SPEAKER_00]: All right, welcome to this Tobacco
University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be covering general design features
for a cannabis production room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into some of the design features
regarding a cannabis production room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally environment factors to
consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just remember that a large room does not
need anything different than a small room,
[SPEAKER_00]: but some environmental aspects can be
harder to achieve as the grow space gets
[SPEAKER_00]: larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basic items to consider which will be
covered here are lights, temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: water, air circulation, plant density,
as well as ceiling height.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into some of the specifics
here starting with lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to know what your electrical
circuit can handle as this may determine
[SPEAKER_00]: the total plants you can grow or what you
need to upgrade to, what kind of level you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to upgrade to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the type and wattage of lights you
plan on using will impact the total
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage area per light.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, you want to take into
consideration other factors such as HVAC
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, fans, and are things that may
need power, but lights tends to require
[SPEAKER_00]: the most wattage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely something to consider there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to our lights, we also have
the temperature to regulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So heating and or cooling a larger space
can be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the regulation of temperature
needs to take into consideration all plant
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just talked about here the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could also be looking at fans and
anything else that you might have running
[SPEAKER_00]: in the production area grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you be using stored water or using
it directly out of a source?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using stored water, can the
floor support the weight of a water tank
[SPEAKER_00]: you plan on using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember one gallon of water weighs about
8.33 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a 250 gallon water tank will weigh
2,082 and a half pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your water source supply the volume
and pressure you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: And to answer that question you need to
know what chosen irrigation system or
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilization system you're using to make
sure that is the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now also the very important air
circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a single room increases in square
feet, moving air can be a continual
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fans on the walls are a common solution,
but more air movement may be necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this could mean overhead fans and or
fans within the grow space might be
[SPEAKER_00]: needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see here there's some on the
walls, but there's also some down here on
[SPEAKER_00]: the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also get to plant, talking about plant
density.
[SPEAKER_00]: So total plants per square foot is
partially dependent on the pruning method,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in general a full-size plant you want
to plan for having one plant per five
[SPEAKER_00]: square feet or two plants per every square
meter just to give you a general idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: how many your plant density should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly ceiling height.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important factor to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: The height of the ceiling can impact the
amount of air circulation and spacing of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher ceilings offer more flexibility for
the growing space, but also make it more
[SPEAKER_00]: costly to enrich with carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again taking into considering these
pros and cons with your grow space and
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely have a plan for each of these
particular environmental factors mentioned here.
