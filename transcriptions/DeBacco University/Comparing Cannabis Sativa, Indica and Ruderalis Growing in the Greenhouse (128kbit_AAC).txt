[SPEAKER_01]: On this DeBaco University video,
we're going to compare cannabis sativa,
[SPEAKER_01]: indica, and ruderalis growing in the
greenhouse so you can see exactly the
[SPEAKER_01]: differences despite them being grown in
relatively the same exact conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're going to be looking at a
greenhouse comparison of the different
[SPEAKER_01]: morphologies of these three different
types.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're growing in the same greenhouse
under the same conditions and Connor will
[SPEAKER_01]: be showing us how different indica,
sativa, and ruderalis plants can look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember the key difference is the plant
growth morphologies as these terms do not
[SPEAKER_01]: match any particular effects as you may
see advertised at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at the sativa, indica,
or ruderalis is really more for the grower
[SPEAKER_01]: to understand the morphologies and how to
best utilize those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first off the sativas just in general
here we can see them clearly known for
[SPEAKER_01]: their can get very tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be a warning to growers looking
at planting a true sativa they can get
[SPEAKER_01]: quite tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the vegetative state these plants can
be already 10 feet tall as we'll see in
[SPEAKER_01]: the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really not into heavy flowering
yet either.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is okay in the greenhouse setting
simply because wind is not an issue
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to growing outdoors but the daily
management of these plants can present
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges not to mention the harvest at
the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we get to our indicas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which are generally a middle growth
pattern compared to the sativas and
[SPEAKER_01]: ruderalis that we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: These tend to be more tame and in the less
aggressive of growth but we could see here
[SPEAKER_01]: as Connor showing they still can get
pretty tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're indicative of their wider leaves
can make them slightly more susceptible to
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf damage compared to the thinner leaves
of a sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we get to the autoflowers or the
ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could see Connor showing the
approximate height there and these are
[SPEAKER_01]: autoflowers and while not originally
thought to be autoflowers in the case for
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants in the greenhouse there's
certainly an auto trait in the lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were not purchased originally to be
an autoflower but it offers a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: comparison here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are great for winter growing in the
greenhouse or a tent or a way that you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you can stagger all your harvests
there because they're going to flower
[SPEAKER_01]: based on days old not dependent on the
photo period.
[SPEAKER_01]: However in this case we're during the peak
growing months of the year giving them a
[SPEAKER_01]: prime greenhouse floor space can be a bit
of waste due to their small size.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can kind of see the areas here of the
floor that are kind of not being covered
[SPEAKER_01]: because they weren't anticipated to be an
autoflower.
[SPEAKER_01]: The slight advantage is that they will be
harvested and removed ahead of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: plants spacing out the harvest process
reducing or staggering some of that labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: However if this was known to if these were
known to be autoflowers when they
[SPEAKER_01]: originally purchased planting them earlier
would have been advised so that two crops
[SPEAKER_01]: could be harvested in the same year
essentially doubling the yield per area
[SPEAKER_01]: and compensating for their small basically
half or even less plant size.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're going to go out to Connor
here in the greenhouse and Connor is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to show us what is growing the greenhouse
and point out the distinctive morphologies
[SPEAKER_01]: of the different classifications of these
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we doing everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are back here in the greenhouse and in
front of me you see a lot of plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: are in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some nugs some buds forming
which is a little weird because if you
[SPEAKER_00]: look behind me you see a bunch of plants
that are almost 10 feet tall 12 feet tall
[SPEAKER_00]: fully in veg still and so what we believe
with this variety our CBG white variety we
[SPEAKER_00]: think that there's an autoflower genetic
somewhere deep in the lineage that has
[SPEAKER_00]: caused us to see this early flowering
compared to these other varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant only grows up to about maybe
four feet tall three feet and it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: budding now for probably about three weeks
compared to behind me near the fan you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see these large behemoths that are fully
in veg with very little signs of flower
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another interesting note behind that fan
you can see how tall those plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: they're almost reaching the top of the
greenhouse that is our sativa dominant CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: variety it is actually CBD V forbidden D
strain and to the to the left of that
[SPEAKER_00]: right where that pole kind of splits off
you can see it our indica dominant some
[SPEAKER_00]: sour lifter CBD strain and so you can
really see the difference in the height
[SPEAKER_00]: and how the leafs are a lot thinner on the
sativas compared to the indica however in
[SPEAKER_00]: this ruderalis autoflower strain in front
of me you're really not seeing that those
[SPEAKER_00]: wide fan leaves or those large families
you're seeing more of these sugar leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: these smaller flowering leaves and while
this may be wanted in say a tent or a
[SPEAKER_00]: small confined space in a greenhouse like
this we really do have the space to to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow these behemoths in these huge sativas
but if you're growing for yourself in a in
[SPEAKER_00]: a small tent at home an autoflower such as
this CBG white strain would be perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: because they would fit right within a two
by two tent and you would get nice yield
[SPEAKER_00]: and you wouldn't really have to worry
about too much defoliating or topping when
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to dealing with a photo dependent
sativa strain you're gonna have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: work on your hands but yeah you can really
see the difference in a consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: environment here and ruderalis sativa in
indica and how different they grow under
[SPEAKER_00]: the same conditions you you you
