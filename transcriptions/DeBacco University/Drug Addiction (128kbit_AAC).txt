[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to be talking about
the topic of drug addiction and we may
[SPEAKER_00]: think of that as being synthetic drugs or
illegal drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind this cup of coffee has
caffeine and this can also be considered
[SPEAKER_00]: or classified as a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drugs in general, we're looking at their
neuromodulators, which are chemicals that
[SPEAKER_00]: prolong the effect of neurotransmitters by
either eating in their release or
[SPEAKER_00]: preventing their reabsorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: For an example, depression may be caused
by a shortage of serotonin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prozac inhibits that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drug addiction in general, cells that are
exposed to chemical signals for a
[SPEAKER_00]: prolonged time lose their sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this mean, the sensitivity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they lose their ability to respond
to the stimulus with the original
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we may have a normal kind of
going on here, where we've got releasing,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got in that synapse here,
that gap between the two neurons,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got that interaction occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, here we see that nerve cells are
particularly prone to the loss of this
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does that look on a molecular
scale?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the arrow here pointing to
this kind of receptor, we can see those
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules are free to move through this
kind of protein here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That protein is being blocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a change in the way the body is
perceiving or releasing and absorbing,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, serotonin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this leaves more serotonin to float
around in that synapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, cells will respond to high
neurotransmitter exposure by inserting
[SPEAKER_00]: fewer protein receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're having this altered protein
receptor amount, which is ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: altering the amount of neurotransmitters
left in that synapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see over time how this
addiction occurs, usually not just once,
[SPEAKER_00]: it occurs over time because there is this
change or this shift in the actual protein
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocaine, as an example here, addiction
occurs with chronic exposure to a drug
[SPEAKER_00]: that induces the nervous system to act in
a physiological way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocaine is a neuromodulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It causes large amounts of
neurotransmitters to remain in the synapse
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of what we saw in the previous
image, this is just an example of a drug
[SPEAKER_00]: that does perform in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dopamine transmits pleasure messages to
the body, and high levels for long periods
[SPEAKER_00]: can cause nerve cells to lower the number
of receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why, typically, cocaine users
need to use more and more to get the same
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, through just one use, or definitely
if you're increasing the dose,
[SPEAKER_00]: it increases the odds of dying from
cocaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see, sadly, this number of deaths
from cocaine comparing males to females
[SPEAKER_00]: over a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now THC, the psychoactive drug found in
cannabis plants, which makes it classified
[SPEAKER_00]: as marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It mimics another neurotransmitter that we
have in our body, causing effects to the
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those effects would be increased sensory
intensity of perceived sensory data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what does that kind of mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of gives the sense of emotional
well-being and reduced concentration or
[SPEAKER_00]: impaired judgment of both time and space.
[SPEAKER_00]: How it kind of works on a molecular level
here is normally we have our cells that
[SPEAKER_00]: may produce inhibitory neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're represented here by the little
blue triangles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They prevent dopamine secretion.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, here we're having this block of
those inhibitory neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's inhibiting the inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, the dopamine's being released
and binds to the receptors here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having this kind of loss of
regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what THC does is it mimics that same
kind of molecular shape and fits into that
[SPEAKER_00]: same receptor, causing the same effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in this case with the green,
we're having it naturally occurring and
[SPEAKER_00]: natural balance is occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're having an artificial
occurrence, which is causing that impaired
[SPEAKER_00]: judgment of time and space and that
feeling of emotional well-being.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to tobacco, which is involved
with nicotine receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They normally serve to bind
acetylchlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brain adjusts to prolong exposure of
nicotine by making fewer nicotine
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors and altering the pattern of
activation of those nicotine receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having a change in the physiological
response and also a reduction in the total
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Addiction occurs because the brain
experiences nicotine-induced changes to
[SPEAKER_00]: protein expression in the synaptic
connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no real easy way to quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way to quit is to quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that's easier said than done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, looking at nicotine, it's a
natural insecticide produced by the
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tobacco plant's actually producing
nicotine to help prevent it from insect
[SPEAKER_00]: damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Synthetic forms of nicotine have been
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called neonicotinoids and they are
a potential risk to reduce bee
[SPEAKER_00]: populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, their use across the country is
quite extensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having this particular insecticide
being spread over large areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a concern with anything where we
potentially could get resistance built up
[SPEAKER_00]: to that or damage to our very important
bee pollinators.
