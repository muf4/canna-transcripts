[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBacco University video,
I'm going to go over some drying area
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions for your cannabis plants,
as well as show you some actual drying
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we'll be a little loud with the fan,
but it just goes to show you the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more than that, you need to be aware
of your temperature as well as humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that you'll learn about here in this
video lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into drying area
conditions for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a wonderful dry room right here
with the plants being cut and hung on the
[SPEAKER_00]: strings, allow good air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see the humidity as well as the
temperature being carefully monitored and
[SPEAKER_00]: within the acceptable range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, those key environmental conditions to
monitor are air circulation, when I have
[SPEAKER_00]: good air movement, temperatures we saw,
moisture content or humidity, light,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as keeping the conditions
consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say light, we're looking at
minimal amount of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the pictures will have the lights
on, but they're at a very low duration of
[SPEAKER_00]: time and a very low intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the all important air
circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is important while growing the
plants and also while drying the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maintaining good air circulation is
critical to any dry rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said later in this video, you'll see me
in actual drying area and you'll hear a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of background noise because a lot of
fans running.
[SPEAKER_00]: This includes the room itself,
but growers also need to be mindful of the
[SPEAKER_00]: micro environment in the immediate
vicinity of the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times we think about air
circulation, think of the whole room,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's important, but also from a plant or
a bud to bud to bud standpoint as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There does not need to be direct and
consistent airflow on the buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a general air movement of air around
the buds is what's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to kind of have a fan
blowing on them, but have some area of air
[SPEAKER_00]: movement constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think about it on a horizontal
basis as well as a vertical basis here
[SPEAKER_00]: within the dry room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to be monitoring our
temperature, the general range,
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the true target should be as
close to 60 degrees Fahrenheit as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible, with really 58 to 62 being the
ideal range because we really want to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of dial in and have the least amount of
variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really what's a 60 to 70 is the
accepted range, 58 to 62 is the ideal
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of 60 is kind of like the target
number there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be where you're drying buds
on a rack or you're drying buds here where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're hanging them upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to moisture content,
which is basically the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the moisture content of both
the air as well as the buds themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the moisture in the buds
themselves will be changing, starting out
[SPEAKER_00]: at the greatest amount and then decreasing
as the drying process continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will put a strain on your humidity
regulating system in the early part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: drying process, but this is critical to
having a quality end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of when you put all the initial
plants in the area, your dehumidifier will
[SPEAKER_00]: probably be under the greatest stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep an eye on it, keep changing,
taking the water out there and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: it can handle that initial input of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general target for humidity is between
55 and 65 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, again, 60 percent is the ideal
with 58 to 62 percent humidity being the
[SPEAKER_00]: range you should be aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put this kind of image here looking at
relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, it does change from other
plants to clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So young plants to flowering and then
drying there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're recommending 45 to 55.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be some argument as far
as what the exact number is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, if you aim for 60, it's a
pretty good target range there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light that I had mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis should be dried in a dark
environment, but this does not mean any
[SPEAKER_00]: light exposure will ruin the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go in the room, just keep the
time, the lights on minimal and limit the
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see here, you want to go on
and check on anything, get something out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the room perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't think that you can have absolutely
no light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, keep the duration of time as
short as possible and make sure you're
[SPEAKER_00]: turning on the least amount of lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keep the intensity low.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will prevent the degradation of any
compounds within the cannabis buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to keep our conditions
consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though the moisture levels in the
buds will be reduced by about 80 percent,
[SPEAKER_00]: the goal is to keep the dry environment as
consistent as possible despite the change
[SPEAKER_00]: in the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, this will take about seven to
10 days or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during that time or whatever duration
of time you have, you want to ensure that
[SPEAKER_00]: the air circulation is even and
consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature target should be around 60
degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture content should be around 60
percent and light should be minimal,
[SPEAKER_00]: both in intensity as well as duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to keep everything nice and
consistent, kind of like the parallelness
[SPEAKER_00]: of the road tracks throughout the entire
drying conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go out and let's take a look at
some of the cannabis plants actively
[SPEAKER_00]: drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry in advance for the fan noise,
but that just shows the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: having air circulation in the fairly large
areas that you're going to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at that kind of end
of the season harvest drying aspect,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's some of those main stocks all been
caught, all been kind of harvested from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a couple little more to go here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can kind of see the end result.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see some of the pre-manicured buds
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we see some of the areas being
dried here behind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might hear some fans running and
that's because they're trying to maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: good air circulation for all of these
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so here we're looking at some buds
drying on the on the screen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see some hanging upside down on this
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of that kind of ideal harvest
where we're kind of hanging everything
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some leaves here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be taking some of those off to
again help improve our air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of fans running.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can feel a breeze in this area and
that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure everything is even as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage of using this kind of like
deer netting screen is it allows
[SPEAKER_00]: everything to hang naturally and not to
develop flat spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the lower end here we do have a screen
on the floor which can also be utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part again is just keeping those
consistent conditions, reducing that
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity over time, and maintaining nice
good air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we can kind of see all the
different methods in place at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the kind of the traditional upside
down hanging to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this kind of screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a vertical manner and we have the
horizontal screen down here at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to keep in mind that
this drying process can take many forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we just see a couple of them here and
all of their own advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one allows the buds to dry so that
there's no flat spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one on the horizontal can be stacked
and be very easy to set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have the manual labor of hanging
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the upside down plants
for the volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll also notice in this room that the
lighting for the most part is relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: dim because we don't need large amounts of
bright lights during this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do want to be coming in here and
inspecting to make sure everything is
[SPEAKER_00]: running well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may also notice the floor is covered
with a tarp material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, cleanliness is important,
consistency of conditions, and as a grower
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to be monitoring this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
