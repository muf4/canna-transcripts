[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to go over tips and tricks
to help you avoid potential issues with
[SPEAKER_00]: aeroponic cannabis cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, if you've tried an aeroponic
cloner and didn't have great success,
[SPEAKER_00]: I may fall into one of these issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are looking at starting with
aeroponic cloning, hopefully this will
[SPEAKER_00]: help you avoid potential issues early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with some of the common
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first is pH imbalance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many times growers, they have something
that's too acidic or too basic,
[SPEAKER_00]: not realize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why it's always important to
have a good monitor system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also want to make sure your temperature is
in the acceptable range.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not, that's going to cause
potentially your roots to burn if it's too
[SPEAKER_00]: hot or not really forming any great rate
if it's too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, nutrient levels tend to be more on
the excessive side with what I see some
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has their own kind of gauge or
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would first start with any solutions
you're adding to definitely follow the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer's recommendations or even go
less, do not go more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the problem solver and how can
you avoid these issues?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I use the Blue Labs Guardian monitor
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides live readings of the parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be EC or TDS, whatever you
choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature could be in Fahrenheit or
Celsius, as well as the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great way to look at three
main factors, environmental factors for
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning to help ensure all of them are
within your preset acceptable target
[SPEAKER_00]: ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, items a grower must have on hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there's many things growers
should have on hand, but these are some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the very basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most basic would be a pH up and a pH
down solution to ensure you're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep that pH within your target range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, standard lotus blend of nutrients
can be a great addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you don't need a ton of different
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Clonex clone solution really can work
sometimes even just plain water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's everything set up ahead of time,
pH-wise, temperature-wise, that can also
[SPEAKER_00]: be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding little nutrients can help increase
your odds of success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are some advanced options
depending on what level you want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there's no substitute for basically
checking your plants, there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: additional options that can help reduce
the time from when something goes wrong to
[SPEAKER_00]: when you know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could set in certain alarms or alerts,
text messages, get automatic emails sent
[SPEAKER_00]: out to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only would you be aware of it,
there's even options where you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: automatic dosing, where if the computer
realizes the pH is coming up too high,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can add particular solutions to help
bring that pH back down to your acceptable
[SPEAKER_00]: range to avoid large swings in potential
environmental conditions that would reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: your rooting success.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, there's monitors with alerts,
and there's many different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can alert you when a condition's
outside of the program acceptable range
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have set.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be sent immediately to you so
you're aware live as it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can be right there and hopefully
offer a correction point with the minimal
[SPEAKER_00]: duration of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to also allow you to correct
the issue with minimal time stress on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the whole goal here is to
maximize your rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's also, as I mentioned,
there's automatic dosing solutions here
[SPEAKER_00]: where for high-end operations,
the ranges can be set and monitor can be
[SPEAKER_00]: connected to an automatic dose injector
where it can kind of work automatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the environmental condition becomes
out of the acceptable range, the computer
[SPEAKER_00]: can automatically correct it with little
or no input from the grower once the
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions are set up by the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a hands-free approach and is ideal
for large-scale operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking here at some callus
formations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the formation of callus can be an
indication that something is not quite
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: An initial small callus may be followed
quickly by the root formation,
[SPEAKER_00]: so don't think immediately when you see
callus something's going wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're getting an increase in the
size of the callus without roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be an indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: With large callus, a grower needs to check
the environmental conditions the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are in to hopefully ensure that the pH,
nutrients, and temperature are all in the
[SPEAKER_00]: correct ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I provided you with just an indication
of the ranges that I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, you want to be thinking about the
length that you have for the stem for
[SPEAKER_00]: rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers cut them a little too short,
try to get away with too small of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this additional video, I'm going to
walk you through a comparison of different
[SPEAKER_00]: stem lengths to give you the idea of what
the proper stem length should be to ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: you have the best success with your
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at our cannabis clones here,
we'll notice that this one has a very
[SPEAKER_00]: turgid leaf, very upright, very how it
should look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice kind of turgid leaf right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one looks a little more flaccid,
a little more kind of milky kind of look
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the possible reason for the
difference between these two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you look closely, they were both
harvested at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both in the same area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes a little perplexing,
some growers find, how can one can look so
[SPEAKER_00]: good and another one can kind of look kind
of on that more milky like look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's investigate this a little bit
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we kind of zoom out here just a little
bit, and we look at the turgid leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: start with this one first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that clone, that little water
spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at this clone, we can notice
the amount of area that was left below.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I kind of work this one out,
put that there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the area that was left below,
we can see that there is definitely a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant portion of rooting area on
there for this clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the Wilty one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we compare that one right next to it,
we can clearly see that there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we kind of go up and look a little
bit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at the difference
between these two, the rooting area.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the more turgid one here, definitely
much larger area here located right below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to the one that is definitely
more flaccid and more Wilty, we can
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly see that this one has a much less
area to root in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's causing the kind of
flaccid like look to the leaves here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to the one that is definitely
more turgid, we can see those leaves able
[SPEAKER_00]: to support themselves horizontally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we clearly see this plant has an
adequate area down here for rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why these leaves are a lot more
turgid, able to support itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it hasn't rooted yet, but definitely
looks much better overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: In comparison, when we look at this plant,
we can see how much more flaccid it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves much more droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's simply because the rooting area
here is much more limiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not much area to absorb water
to maintain the hydration in this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it may root end up just fine,
but right now looking a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: droopy than the one we saw previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot more flaccid to this one simply
because of the limited rooting area here
[SPEAKER_00]: and ability to absorb water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're looking at right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're looking at right now.
Thanks for watching, and we'll see you
next time.
