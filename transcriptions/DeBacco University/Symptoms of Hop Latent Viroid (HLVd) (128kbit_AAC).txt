[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
if you think you've got hoplite and
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid, well here I'm going to go over
some of the symptoms of this viroid to see
[SPEAKER_00]: if they match up to what you might be
seeing or should be on the lookout for.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm going to go over some of
the symptoms of hoplite and viroid and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can see it's quite variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are coloration changes, some are
morphological changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I want to really give you a
good resource this Canomed23 presentation
[SPEAKER_00]: by Dr. Zamir Poonja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Provides some of the great images here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw screenshots from the presentation he
gave.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to hear from him directly,
by sure check this link out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the description I've got all my
references to some other sources I used as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, but another good resource to take a
look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I want you to understand
that while the disease can be the same or
[SPEAKER_00]: the viroid can be the same, the looks can
vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two campus plants infected with the same
viroid can have a wide degree of different
[SPEAKER_00]: visual symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll test the same, but there's
different ways he can be infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: To catch it early does take a trained eye
and seeing a lot of plants and seeing a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of infected plants allows you to pick
it out a little bit sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see we have stunting, obviously,
or vegetative plants pre-flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: High susceptibility of genotype shows
stunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the roots will be affected and
not really getting a great proliferation
[SPEAKER_00]: of roots, even though they're not
discolored.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the inflorescence or the flowers
can also be infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really affects roots, shoots,
as well as final flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: A stage of development does have an
impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind that while symptoms
you may see are in part dependent on the
[SPEAKER_00]: stage of development, the plant,
and also when and physically on the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: where the point of infection may have
occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early flowering plants can tend to be the
most symptomatic or plants going into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower is where you tend to get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see here stunting that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different changes in morphology,
all things that kind of just, this don't
[SPEAKER_00]: quite look right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, while this seemed like a pretty
long and extensive list, slow growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, stunting or those kind of
decreased internode spacing, leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: malformations, leaf chlorosis can mimic an
iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of over here in these images,
you could see it kind of looks like an
[SPEAKER_00]: iron deficiency with those upper leaves
being a little lighter in coloration,
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter green to yellow coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf chlorosis is a symptom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brittle stems, reduced root formation,
as we can see the comparison between the
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy and infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horizontal growth that can grow up like an
exponential curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of gets a little bit more of
this distinctive kind of U-shaped parabola
[SPEAKER_00]: shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: A greater leaf overlap, reduced water
intake, flower destruction, smaller and
[SPEAKER_00]: less dense, basically equals reduced
yields in the end, which is not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also been evidence of this stem or
node swelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how common this is,
but another YouTube video had shown this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a positive case.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a confirmed case of hoplite and
viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: May not be commonly reported, but it
definitely does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of node swelling that we see
here, very distinctive, something very
[SPEAKER_00]: unique that would stick out, might be an
indication if you're seeing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might want to get that plant tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this can vary greatly on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why when sampling, different
portions of the plant should be taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Special attention to the roots for hoplite
and viroid can initially accumulate in
[SPEAKER_00]: this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here where we're getting
hoplite and viroid negative and positive,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the THC percentage went from 27.8
down to 15.9.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost some terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that the smaller flowers
at the bottom of the plant, due to hoplite
[SPEAKER_00]: and viroid infection, had 42% lower THC
and 15% lower terpenes compared to normal
[SPEAKER_00]: sized healthy flowers on the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great information, again, provided by,
in that presentation linked at the top,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as some others in the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this can vary by cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is gaining a lot of interest and
rightfully so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while there are no cultivars that have
been shown to be completely resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: hoplite and viroid, there are some early
data indicators that some may be more
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerant than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could potentially be used as part of
a breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can show consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is right now in the early stages,
but there definitely does seem to be some
[SPEAKER_00]: variability to resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or at least tolerance, I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's really resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love these kind of really close zoomed
up images of the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's reduced size and shape of the
trichomes compared to the healthy to the
[SPEAKER_00]: infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind, there's not really a
reduction in number of trichomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there really is a reduction in the
kind of quality of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this directly impacts the compounds
that the plant, of course, can produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Infected trichomes are basically
underdeveloped.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of look like what would be a
full balloon to kind of look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just deflated and kind of much
smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, they actually have less in
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another stunting effect,
not only of the plant, but stunting the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect of the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, again, reducing overall
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly here, impacts on variety
by cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're looking at healthy versus
infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy here hanging to dry and slightly
infected hanging to dry here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's really a matter of how
much the plant cannabinoids are reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that the cultivar does
have an impact on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of genomes listed here,
plant heights, flower to stem length,
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh flower weight, THC content.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the changes that do occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this isn't an indica only,
this isn't a sativa only, a rudalis,
[SPEAKER_00]: a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of lumping these all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no yet indication that indica,
sativa, or rudalis is more or less
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of genotype or cultivar
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, trying to give you just that
general idea of some things to kind of be
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit on the lookout for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got other videos on the channel
on this because this is becoming more
[SPEAKER_00]: recognized and that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to be identified and then
develop a plan to kind of remove this as
[SPEAKER_00]: the hopeful, the long-term goal.
Thank you.
Thank you.
