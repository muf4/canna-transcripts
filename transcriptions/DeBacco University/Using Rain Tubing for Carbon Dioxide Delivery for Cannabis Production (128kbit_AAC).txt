[SPEAKER_00]: If you're considering using rain tubing
for carbon dioxide delivery, here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Tobacco University, we're going to go over
some of the details of this method if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at enriching an area with
carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into using rain
tubing for carbon dioxide delivery for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, what is rain tubing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And rain tubing is simple tubing that has
small pinholes at a consistent distance
[SPEAKER_00]: apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's commonly hung on light fixtures to
allow the carbon dioxide to rain down on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants, and that's where it gets its
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice here, there's an example of
this small little pinholes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they are small, but they're evenly
distributed to allow that kind of even
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery of carbon dioxide throughout the
entire growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the setup of this rain tubing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, rain tubing should be placed in a
loop and put in, attached to the regulator
[SPEAKER_00]: with a T fitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure, as our image
shows here, we're using, in this example,
[SPEAKER_00]: a bottled carbon dioxide system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have carbon dioxide coming out,
going to a T fitting, going to the loop
[SPEAKER_00]: here containing all of the rain tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to feed the loop from the
bottle on both ends here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I use a T fitting, because this
will help ensure an even and consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution of the carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this can be for a small 25 foot
section, or this can also be utilized for
[SPEAKER_00]: a hundred feet of rain tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same concept does apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what height should I be mounting my
rain tubing at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, keep in mind that carbon dioxide is
heavier than air, so it will naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: want to sink in the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, most growers will mount the
tubing above the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, growers need to take into
consideration their specific growing
[SPEAKER_00]: space, meaning, where is your exhaust
system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is your sensor going to be placed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how tall will your plants get?
[SPEAKER_00]: These can play into different factors when
you're looking at how best to mount your
[SPEAKER_00]: rain tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, should be relatively high in the
plant canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensor should be placed usually just a
little bit above that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how tall your plants will get,
if they're going to get really tall,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might want to have a system where you
can adjust this during the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, general recommendations is that when
using a grow tent, as an example,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we see here, put the rain tubing along
the interior perimeter, about one half to
[SPEAKER_00]: two thirds of the way up the plant on
three walls, dipping down in front to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow easy access is preferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in this example here, you can see I
put the rain tubing right along here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then all of a sudden you don't see it
in front of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because the rain tubing kind of
dips down here, we have a flood and drain
[SPEAKER_00]: table, it's tie wrapped below here,
and it comes up this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why it drops low in this area,
this allows easy access to plants in and
[SPEAKER_00]: out, as well as growers to work their way
in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this setup, the sensor should be
about one foot above the tubing,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we can see right here, to avoid
potential incorrect readings and to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide an accurate assessment of the
enrichment level of carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: in this grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also keeps the rain tubing away from
the exhaust filter here, and you see
[SPEAKER_00]: notice this small fan here to make the
distribution even, so there's no hot spots
[SPEAKER_00]: or stratification that occurs even in this
small grow tent.
