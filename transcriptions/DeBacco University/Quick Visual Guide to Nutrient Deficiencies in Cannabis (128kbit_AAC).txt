[SPEAKER_00]: As the name implies, this will be a quick
visual guide of nutrient deficiencies in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you identify any of the images,
something you may have, there'll be more
[SPEAKER_00]: detailed videos provided here on DeBaco
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get to that quick visual
guide for nutrient deficiencies in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, try to avoid those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to focus on the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: If nutrient deficiency is suspected,
be sure the pH the plants are growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: is near optimum, as this will ensure
nutrients are available to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, we're talking in that six-ish
range, six to seven or so, getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: quality pH meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it does pH, temperature as well as EC
or PPM is also advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here are just some of the major
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one is nitrogen, where the
lower leaves are yellowing and the upper
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves are still yellowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus shows this kind of overall kind
of yellowing with some brown colorations,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically found lower in the leaf canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And potassium is evident by the yellowing
of the leaf margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at our secondary nutrients,
we have magnesium, which is yellowing
[SPEAKER_00]: inter-vanally, meaning between the veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have calcium, which is this kind of
brown speckling along with some yellowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then iron deficiency, which is those
upper leaves are showing the yellow,
[SPEAKER_00]: unlike the nitrogen deficiency or the
lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: As said before, this was intended to be a
short video.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of these look like of concern in
your plants, search the channel for more
[SPEAKER_00]: detail on all of these nutrient
deficiencies here on Tobacco University.
