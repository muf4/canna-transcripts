[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this tobacco university video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be looking at carbon dioxide levels
of 400 to 800 parts per million and how it
[SPEAKER_00]: relates to cannabis plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you're looking at enriching your
area between 400 and 800 parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should you keep in mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the video content.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll first off realize that 400 parts per
million is normal atmospheric conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: and elevating the levels above this will
require the use of several pieces of
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to increase the overall plant
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those pieces of equipment may be the
ones included in the picture or it could
[SPEAKER_00]: be some other but something is going to be
needed to be added.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the equipment list in general is going
to be a carbon dioxide source,
[SPEAKER_00]: a method of delivering that carbon dioxide
in a monitoring system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Options will be discussed in other videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: This video focuses on the chosen range and
its impact on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The image that I have here just shows what
a bottle system might entail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off looking at that 400 to 800
parts per million as the environment is in
[SPEAKER_00]: rich, closer to the upper end of this
range, the use of high powered lights
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes more advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under high light, the plants become carbon
dioxide limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher light can relate to increase in
biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here we can see light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see a relative rate of
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part here is at different carbon
dioxide levels, we can see that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain light saturation point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we increase the levels of carbon
dioxide, the saturation point or the light
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity is increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're only kind of at the
atmospheric or lower end levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get away with lower levels of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we increase carbon dioxide,
plants can take advantage of that and
[SPEAKER_00]: increase their photosynthetic rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the target range of 400 to 800 parts
per million, this enrichment level will
[SPEAKER_00]: cause the least amount of costs associated
with purchasing carbon dioxide,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what source you choose to get
that carbon dioxide from.
[SPEAKER_00]: This level is also the easiest to achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be the best for large grow areas
and also small areas that have regular
[SPEAKER_00]: venting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting above those atmospheric
conditions and you will potentially see
[SPEAKER_00]: that increase in yield as well,
assuming no other limiting factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you want to consider the entire
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, as I said, no limiting factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming other plant factors in the
environment are not limiting, there will
[SPEAKER_00]: be an increase in plant growth compared to
atmospheric levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are those other factors to take into
consideration?
[SPEAKER_00]: Light, water, air, temperature and
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those need to be optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind, when you're
supplementing carbon dioxide and plants
[SPEAKER_00]: might want to grow more aggressively,
they may need more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may need more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending how you're adding the carbon
dioxide, you might want to watch the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, the air circulation,
all things to take into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the cost to benefit ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's different systems that can be
set up, but a grower must consider the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost of the implementation of carbon
dioxide enrichment system and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: expected rate of return on that
investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comparing a few growth cycles of normal
atmosphere and atmospheric conditions can
[SPEAKER_00]: provide a good baseline to develop your
comparison to determine, is it really
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would you select this range of 400
to 800 parts per million?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this can be an initial range chosen
to check to make sure all systems are
[SPEAKER_00]: working well with minimum risk of wasting
carbon dioxide, which can get expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often this can be due to required
ventilation to see how much carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: is exhausted and how easy or hard it is to
maintain levels even at this range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, growers can see just how quote
unquote airtight their enclosures actually
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important if you're planting auto
flowers because maximizing each day of the
[SPEAKER_00]: limited growing cycle is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while many growers will shoot higher
than the 800 part per million level,
[SPEAKER_00]: shooting that 400 to 800 part per million
can be a great way once you get everything
[SPEAKER_00]: initially set to kind of go through any
last checks just to make sure you're ready
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're looking at trying different
levels or to determine if this is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: work for your operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much for watching.
