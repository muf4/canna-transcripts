[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to be looking at
the taxonic classification system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a way that we simply develop and
able to organize certain species to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine how they may be related and
which ones are more closely related than
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Aristotle's system is one of the first
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: He developed the first widely accepted
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about 2,400 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two main groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: He divided them into plants and animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are based on the size, stem,
animals based on where they lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were a plant, did you have a
soft stem or a woody stem or were you like
[SPEAKER_00]: a shrub?
[SPEAKER_00]: For animals, did you tend to live in the
air?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you live in the water or were you a
land dweller?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did you basically live?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the very first of the taxonomy,
the way of classifying group things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now to name organisms, biologists use
multi-level grouping of individuals called
[SPEAKER_00]: classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is it important to place things
into categories?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's later groups to be formed to
refer to a genre or similar genus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows us to better organize or see
what organisms might be closer related for
[SPEAKER_00]: comparative purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by organizing them into their
distinctive regions, it can help us draw
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusions, it can help us find some
information out, figure out one particular
[SPEAKER_00]: subspecies, it can help us explain or look
for solutions in other regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The invention of the male system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's often referred to as the father of
taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: His basic concept for naming, ranking,
and classifying organisms is still in wide
[SPEAKER_00]: use today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each level is included in a level above
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Level gets increasingly specific from
kingdom to species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the kingdom is very broad.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's like animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we've got breaking it down to like
mammals and we're getting all the way down
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice the grizzly bear is the
species very specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the grizzly bear appears in all of
the prior levels above it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, as you work your way up,
animals are included that are more
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctly related.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here in animals, we've got dogs,
we've got snakes, we've got birds,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got insects, often considered
animals along with the grizzly bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the genus, which is just above the
species, there's only the grizzly bear and
[SPEAKER_00]: the black bear, very closely related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to these other organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of leave it like a funnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: A group of organisms at a particular level
in classification system are called taxon,
[SPEAKER_00]: or taxa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taxonomy is the branch of biology that
identifies the names of the organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Species again being the most specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see our red fox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like the lab that we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Domain is the broadest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contains a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked our way to kingdom, phylum,
class, order, family, genus, all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: down to specific species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Species names are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organisms are named using Latin in such a
way that no two have the same name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common names can be very misleading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these are called dolphin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is dolphin the flipper, the one you
may initially associate with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fish is also called a dolphin.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, here's a mammal being called
a dolphin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a fish being called a dolphin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mahi-mahi is what this may also go by,
but technically both these are dolphins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run into this problem at restaurants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see dolphin on the menu, it's not the
mammal, it's the mahi-mahi, or the fish
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can be kind of misleading there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we use our scientific names.
[SPEAKER_00]: These common names are make poor labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these and these are both bears.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether it's a grizzly bear,
polar bear, koala bear, black bear,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all bears.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to be specific with our names
so we know what we're talking about when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're conveying this to others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the modern system, each kingdom,
plant, and animal was divided into phylum,
[SPEAKER_00]: each phylum into smaller groups called the
class, class divided into order,
[SPEAKER_00]: order divided into families, families
divided into genus, and each genus divided
[SPEAKER_00]: into species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, our life is divided into
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take a subset of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our domain, a subset of that's
kingdom, phylum, class, order,
[SPEAKER_00]: family, genus, and species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Species being the most specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see that diagrammed here with
our domain is the broadest category,
[SPEAKER_00]: our kingdom, phylum, class, order,
family, genus, species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the point of subspecies,
where there's individuals that can break
[SPEAKER_00]: down even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these build on one another and get
more and more specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're building it as we go
up, others as we go down, as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same pattern repeats itself, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kingdom, phylum, class, order,
family, genus, and species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The order is important to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we try to memorize that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a mnemonic device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Domain is the broadest category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kingdom, a little bit more specific,
down to phylum, class, order, family,
[SPEAKER_00]: genus, species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have subspecies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to come up with your own,
put those kind of pictures here with just
[SPEAKER_00]: the letters.
[SPEAKER_00]: One example is does King Philip come over
for grape soda?
[SPEAKER_00]: Domain, kingdom, phylum, class,
order, family, genus, and species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the font gets smaller here,
indicating it's getting more specific
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's working way down the funnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that mnemonic device may help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's a species?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about we're going all the
way down to the species level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we probably should define what a
species actually is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a species is a group of individuals
that can breed with one another and
[SPEAKER_00]: produce fertile offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That and is very important because a horse
and a donkey produce a mule, but the mule
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot produce fertile offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason being, a horse has basically
gametes divided, you know, 64 is deployed,
[SPEAKER_00]: 62 is for the donkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: A mule through the combination of these
produces 63, which means it can't produce
[SPEAKER_00]: gametes because it already has an odd
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have a horse and a donkey
cross together, you can get a mule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is evidence when the horse is the
female and the donkey is the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the three roles are reversed and the
horse here again is the male and the
[SPEAKER_00]: donkey is the female, you get something
called a henny.
[SPEAKER_00]: A horse bred with a horse, you're getting
a horse, a donkey with a donkey,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting a donkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's important that in order to get a
mule to begin with, even though they
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't technically a species because
they're sterile, the horse needs to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: female and the donkey needs to be a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you get a mule.
[SPEAKER_00]: The henny is the opposite when the horse
is the male and the donkey is the female.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks can be deceiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at basing things on
phenotype, we have to be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The willow wobbler and the chicherath are
almost identical in appearance,
[SPEAKER_00]: but do not interbreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially, on a quick look,
both of these pictures look very similar,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're actually very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's a species?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about 1.5 million species that
have been named.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, scientists estimate that at least
10 million species exist and at least
[SPEAKER_00]: two-thirds of these occur in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see our world map encoded for
density of our vertebrate species.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot dense here in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice that there's a very distinctive
line here where there's like all of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sudden nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know anything about this northern
region of Africa, a lot of desert,
[SPEAKER_00]: not very conducive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a tropical rainforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a much moderated climate,
very warm, and that's what's allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: these species to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's such a high number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our extinction rate versus our number of
species, there's that equilibrium that
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is true for all environments,
even though it may shift slightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always going to be that
convergence point of the extinction rate
[SPEAKER_00]: and the new species rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's our last little comparison here
of classifying hierarchy of organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Textiles split species into subsets called
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peaches and nectarines are different
varieties of the peach tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So main difference is the presence of fuzz
in the skin in disease-resistant peaches,
[SPEAKER_00]: stated here, are more disease-resistant
and have fuzz, and the nectarines are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually a little less resistant,
disease-resistant, and that's very smooth,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of shiny texture as it looks here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are called subsets or varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are different varieties of the peach
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these are going to share a lot
of similarities, but there's also slight
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: The presence of fuzz doesn't necessarily
mean that it's disease-resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something's fuzzy, it doesn't make it
more disease-resistant, but in this case
[SPEAKER_00]: with peaches, they're evident by that
fuzz, and they also have slightly more
[SPEAKER_00]: disease-resistance to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus a nectarine, they have that shiner
kind of coat to it and a little less
[SPEAKER_00]: disease-resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that helps explain some of the
taxonomy and classification of organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
