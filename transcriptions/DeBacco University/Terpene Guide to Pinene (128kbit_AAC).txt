[SPEAKER_00]: This DeBaco University video is going to
get into some of the details of the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene pinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the terpene
guide for pinning here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the scent location and
properties of this particular terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as the name kind of implies,
we kind of can see it in the term,
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of has that pine or woody pinning
kind of like scent to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's found in basil and parsley,
pine nuts, citrus fruits, can also be
[SPEAKER_00]: found in pine needles and can be seeped in
hot water and consumed as a tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not just unique to a cannabis
plant because it is commonly found in pine
[SPEAKER_00]: trees as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pinning actually comes in two isomers or
types, an alpha and a beta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the alpha which smells like pine
needles and is the most commonly found
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene in nature, kind of important fact
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then beta which smells like rosemary,
basil, dill or parsley, some herbs you may
[SPEAKER_00]: might be familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a slight change, you can see the
double bond is located right here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: alpha, double bond is located up here in
the beta and that does change the scent
[SPEAKER_00]: properties, scent as well as other
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the medical benefits just in general
here, nice little summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an antioxidant, so it prevents
oxidation damage from other molecules in
[SPEAKER_00]: the body, an important aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pinning is also a powerful bronchodilator
which helps improve airflow of the lungs
[SPEAKER_00]: for those that might be suffering with
asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has anti-inflammatory and
pain-relieving antimicrobial antibacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pinning also crosses the blood-brain
barrier, improving memory and alertness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also may counteract some negative
qualities typically found with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're looking for what strains
might be a little bit higher in this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular terpene, well here is in
general a kind of list here as far as to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide you with a starting point as far
as some strains to look at as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: another little summary slide here if
you're looking at learning more about the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene pinning.
Thank you.
