[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to be looking at the cut
and stick method, you need to choose what
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate you're going to stick your clone
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, we're going to cover some of the
most common options to help you make an
[SPEAKER_00]: educated decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into substrate options
for the cut and stick method of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, options to use that I'll be
covering in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwell, oasis, and foam all kind of fall
into a similar category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sand as well as soilless media will be
covered here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can choose the best option that
fits your growing situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, let's talk about oasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a foam that's inert and
designed to provide a soilless growing
[SPEAKER_00]: medium for plant roots that's capable of
supplying water in a steady basis without
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting pH or the growing environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are all great attributes or
positive attributes to oasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: May look like Rockwell cubes, but they are
made from a different material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about Rockwell in the next
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also capillary action,
which is kind of like a sponge effect
[SPEAKER_00]: through the foam that ensures a constant
supply of water to the plant roots or
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're germinating seeds, that is
advantageous for the propagation of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lower density foam keeps the top of
the cubes dryer, which reduces algae
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and increases root zone aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say reduces algae growth,
if you over saturate it, we can see in the
[SPEAKER_00]: picture here, you still can get some algae
growth, but definitely a reduced level if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're keeping the moisture the proper
amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that Rockwell that I had mentioned,
sometimes referred to as Stonewall,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's manufactured so it can be made to fit
specific applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: The material is inert and holds water
while still providing aeration to the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots, great benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also growers near complete control over
the dial-in feeding program, which can
[SPEAKER_00]: help maximize plant growth in production
for that grower that can feed the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what it needs in the exact
quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would talk about sand here briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible, but not really the best
option because it can have some
[SPEAKER_00]: inconsistent moisture levels in the root
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can have little dry pockets or
sometimes little wet pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a very heavy material.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at transporting or
having it on a grow bench, it can also,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it can be easily acquired by growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically play sand would be used
clean, sterile, not a lot of weeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: other advantages of using sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to lastly here, Soilless Media
here has similar general properties to
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, but is much more favorable for
container growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also does have some buffering capacity,
unlike some of the ones that I mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many different blends and manufacturers to
fit a wide variety of growing situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's just one Soilless
Media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growers can buy once and be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to mix or blend or kind of
do anything else on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can open the bag and immediately
start using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're choosing the cut and stick
method, hopefully this will provide you
[SPEAKER_00]: with some information on selecting the
best substrate for it to fit your conditions.
