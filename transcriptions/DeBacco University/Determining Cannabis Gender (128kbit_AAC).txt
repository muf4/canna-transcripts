[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go over two ways that you can
determine a cannabis plant's gender.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just by visually looking at them,
you can't tell whether it's male or
[SPEAKER_00]: female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be an issue when you're looking
at mainly wanting to produce female plants
[SPEAKER_00]: for the buds and cannabinoids that they
can produce for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should only be needed if you're
starting from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to go through the labor
and equipment of this intensive process of
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning and propagating, be sure you know
the gender of your plant ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Males should only be cloned by breeders
who want to repeat a very specific cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, only female plants should be
cloned.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you go through and grow all your
little seedlings, this is where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to determine whether these are male
plants or female plants from an early
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have a known female, you can use
that and repeat this process with that
[SPEAKER_00]: known gender that you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most efficient method can be something
called PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what large scale operations are
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called polymerase chain reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's short for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a technique used to identify the
gender of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be done as early as around the four
true leaf stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's great about this method is only a
very small leaf sample is needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a hole punch and then you add it
to the PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: What PCR basically does is multiply DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at using this to determine
the gender of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can allow for very early cloning of
males and reduce the time wasted on
[SPEAKER_00]: non-target plants and virtually eliminate
the chance that pollen in the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: facility from a plant that's a male that
could cross contaminate, in most cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that's a little cost prohibitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that's a little bit easier to do
and scales down in a small scale operation
[SPEAKER_00]: is to simply grow a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does take longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a cutting of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a small branch cutting and put it in
a cloner and put it in under a flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help induce flowering,
which will allow you to clearly identify
[SPEAKER_00]: if that plant is male or female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if the plants get a little stressed,
that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just looking at getting them to
produce flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes this method work, which can be
a problem with some growers, is to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: good records.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that you have all
these plants labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know which one it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what parent it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do identify one as male,
you are culling out the proper plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: not having a miscommunication on the
records there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these cloners do have a nice
ABC123 system, but I suggest in some way
[SPEAKER_00]: tagging the actual plant with some sort of
color tag or a little label just to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you that extra redundancy so that you're
allowed to keep the good plants and cull
[SPEAKER_00]: out the males without making any mistakes.
Thank you.
