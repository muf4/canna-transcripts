[SPEAKER_00]: This video is going to cover some of the
basics of plant evolution and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: key factors that divide different species
on complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting all the way with the common
ancestor being green algae, and
[SPEAKER_00]: progressing all the way to flowering
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see mosses, ferns, jindosperms,
pine trees being in between the mix there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's four key evolutionary advances
that occurred in the evolution of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant kingdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: First is the alternation of generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the sporophyte, the two end
component of the life cycle, became the
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant generation in all but the
earliest of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the earliest of plants, we're talking
early being close in descendant to that
[SPEAKER_00]: green algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vascular tissue transports water and
nutrients for the plant body and provides
[SPEAKER_00]: structural support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another key evolutionary advancement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another key evolutionary advancement is
development of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This provides nutrients and protection for
the plant embryo until it encounters
[SPEAKER_00]: favorable conditions to grow in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one are flowers and fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is considered the most advanced plant
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: They improve the chances of successful
mating and sedentary organisms and
[SPEAKER_00]: facilitated dispersal of their own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here our non-vascular, our green
algae, our mosses very early in
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-seeded vascular plants are one of the
first ones to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are examples would be ferns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going over to conifers, which are like
pine trees, and then ultimately to
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering plants, which is developing
those fruits in those flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This again gives you the cladogram of kind
of the basic progression here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, green algae is starting at the base
of both of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going on to seedless non-vascular plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going then to seedless vascular plants
that develop the vascular tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: To naked seed plants or gymnosperms,
also you may know them as pine trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately going to flowering seeded
plants called angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be more detail provided on each
of these, but that gives you the basic
[SPEAKER_00]: direction of the proposed evolution of
plant species.
Thank you.
