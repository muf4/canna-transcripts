[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another DeBacco University
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, looking at glass as evidence
involved with crime scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what is glass?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to define what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while glass may not have a specific
melting point, it will soften over a
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be important where arson or
high heat might be involved with a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glass is also a uniform amorphous solid,
which means it has a regular atomic
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, which causes it to break a
variety of fraction patterns, which can
[SPEAKER_00]: vary based on impact, force of impact,
angle of impact, and also the type of
[SPEAKER_00]: glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how is glass used in forensic science?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, small fragments can be used as trace
evidence to link objects and people
[SPEAKER_00]: through crime scene reconstruction
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be involved with directly,
for example, where a bullet is piercing a
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of glass, or sometimes even
accidental, where something might be
[SPEAKER_00]: knocked over and broken, and those trace
elements might be picked up by the person
[SPEAKER_00]: at the scene and found later by an
investigator in their clothing or
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially within their shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is often present in places that are
robbed through burglaries or hit and run
[SPEAKER_00]: accidents as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to keep in mind of this
glass evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in the actual crime scene,
where may it be used?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, automobile accidents where a broken
headlight or even windshield glass could
[SPEAKER_00]: be fractured or damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: A store break-in, as I mentioned,
where shards of window glass with fibers
[SPEAKER_00]: or blood on them can also help link a
person to a scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shots fired into a window.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sequence and actual direction of the
bullets can often be determined by
[SPEAKER_00]: examining the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: These small, minute particles of glass may
be transferred to a subject's shoes or
[SPEAKER_00]: clothing and can provide a source of trace
evidence linking the suspect to the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, again, helpful, but keep in mind
that you really have to be looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: these very small, small pieces,
these trace evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're collecting our glass as
investigators, it's important we do so in
[SPEAKER_00]: a way that tries to collect as many
samples as possible, but it's also
[SPEAKER_00]: protective to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want to, in that process,
want to collect the standard reference
[SPEAKER_00]: glass should be taken from the crime
scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking about an inch square.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to package it in a solid container
to prevent breakage and indicate interior
[SPEAKER_00]: and exterior surfaces if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The presence of dirt, paint, grease,
or putty may help identify the inside and
[SPEAKER_00]: outside surfaces if they're known.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking at a piece of glass,
maybe a window, and you know where the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside is, make note of what side that is
on the glass that you're collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to preserve garments with glass on
it, and that can include shoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: pants, even shirts, anything that may have
that potential for carrying that trace
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: All broken glass must be recovered and
submitted to analysis when direction of
[SPEAKER_00]: impact is desired and as many pieces as
possible to help make that process as
[SPEAKER_00]: simplified as can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we get these pieces of glass
evidence, well, when the suspect and crime
[SPEAKER_00]: scene fragments are assembled and
physically fit together, and this can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: very time-consuming process, comparisons
of this type do require the piecing of
[SPEAKER_00]: these irregularities in the broken glass,
as well as matching all these
[SPEAKER_00]: irregularities and striations on the
broken surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: The possibility that two pieces of glass
originating from different sources will
[SPEAKER_00]: fit together exactly is unlikely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a way to exclude other sources
from physical consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, most glass evidence is
either too fragmented or too minute to
[SPEAKER_00]: permit a comparison of this type.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the reason why it's so
important to try to collect as many pieces
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets a little more confusing if you
have a window that's broken into,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then, for example, a wine glass
breaks, or some other form of glass,
[SPEAKER_00]: a mirror is shattered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of get those mixing of the two
pieces there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're comparing our glass
samples, the goal is to find and measure
[SPEAKER_00]: the properties that will associate one
glass fragment to another while minimizing
[SPEAKER_00]: or limiting the possibility exists of
other sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to common occurrences of glass,
it can present quite a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though there's glasses of
different types, it can be a difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison to make there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind that while this
will help you tell part of the story,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going to be the one defining
factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take probably other ways of
collecting of other pieces of other
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence, and this will be one component
which could be a very important component,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is why when collecting samples,
we want to be very mindful of ensuring
[SPEAKER_00]: we're collecting a quality sample.
