[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at the DNA replication
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while initially this might look like a
lot's going on, and that's true,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to break it down step by step
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting here with the basics of the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So DNA is double stranded and it unwinds,
and there's two unwound strands,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's a replication fork,
that's where the two strands are initially
[SPEAKER_00]: divided.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these new strands are formed by
pairing complementary bases to the old
[SPEAKER_00]: strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that template strand, these
complementary bases, being bound there to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the chance for errors and make this
very efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the end, two molecules of DNA,
we see kind of at the end here,
[SPEAKER_00]: are created or made, with each having one
old strand and one new strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this process is known as being
semi-conservative replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does DNA copy itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, looking back at that same image we
saw at the title slide, DNA helicase
[SPEAKER_00]: begins by unwinding the nucleosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here by that little blue triangle,
separating out our double helix into
[SPEAKER_00]: individual single strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helicase untwists that double helix and
exposes those complementary strands,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the enzyme primase puts down a short
piece of RNA termed the primer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, that RNA primer is kind of
like the little flag that says,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, DNA polymerase, you're going to
start here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What DNA's polymerase does is that reads
along each single strand by adding the
[SPEAKER_00]: complementary nucleotides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, adenine binds with thiamine,
abines with thiamine, the T and G binds
[SPEAKER_00]: with C, guanine with cytosine,
a purine and a pyrimidine binding
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this replication site does not just
occur in one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may occur in many areas, and in fact
it does, particularly for eukaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each nucleotide strand serves as a
template building for the new
[SPEAKER_00]: complementary strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these little bubbles will eventually
meet, creating a replication of the
[SPEAKER_00]: original form of DNA in a
semi-conservative nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the process of DNA replication can be
summarized as that helicase first
[SPEAKER_00]: unwinding that DNA, then the primase
putting down that short primer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that RNA primer located right
here, and polymerase reading along and
[SPEAKER_00]: adding in the complementary bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that polymerase only works in
the five to three prime direction as it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a leading strand that we're
focusing on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this replication process, this is a
valing DNA copied by a replication machine
[SPEAKER_00]: that travels along the replication fork.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where helicase is initially
unwinding the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most important members of this
complex is that polymerase because that is
[SPEAKER_00]: the one responsible for adding the
nucleotides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's able to add those nucleotides,
creating and making that new DNA sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that here with them binding
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now realize that there is not just one DNA
polymerase, there's kind of a complex of
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA polymerases, but for right now there's
no DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA polymerase is going through and adding
in those complementary forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleotides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that polymerase, all the interface
have two properties, only synthesize DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: in one direction, that five to three prime
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the DNA vocabulary video,
I talked a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's looking at the number of carbon
atoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's carbon atoms number five and
number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can only add to that number three
carbon area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can only work in the five to three
prime direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now initially you might be looking at this
image going, well, if it can only work in
[SPEAKER_00]: five to three prime direction,
well, why is it right next to the three
[SPEAKER_00]: prime?
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA is actually anti-parallel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at this bottom sequence here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a three prime.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other end of it will be five prime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a five prime.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other end of that sequence will be
three prime because it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-parallel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can only work in the five to three
prime direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be our leading strand
because it's going to be working towards
[SPEAKER_00]: the replication fork.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this will be our lagging strand
because it's working away, has to detach
[SPEAKER_00]: and reattach, detach and reattach.
[SPEAKER_00]: These little fragments are called Okazaki
fragments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see all the kind of individual
components labeled here, A being our
[SPEAKER_00]: template strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: This our leading strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of our lagging strand,
our replication fork.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our RNA primer would be this little
kind of red region we see located here and
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember that's a little flag that
says start here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our Okazaki fragments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one kind of independently here,
but they would be on that lagging strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now of those polymerases I said,
there's a bunch of different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now you can just kind of focus on
polymerase doing this one job,
[SPEAKER_00]: but realize there are four types in humans
and three types in bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this polymerase has a proofreading
mechanism built in, which is great to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the chance of there being errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it checks for base matching,
making sure adenine is binding with
[SPEAKER_00]: thiamine and guanine with cytosine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will remove mismatched bases by going
backwards and ensuring that corrections
[SPEAKER_00]: are made as it reads along and proofreads
that DNA sequence because we do not want
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why it's not able to bind in
the three to five prime direction is
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no energy from ATP hydrolysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is looking at the reason why it
only works in that five to three prime
[SPEAKER_00]: directions, only going to be binding to
that three prime end because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting that kind of phosphate binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now DNA polymerase is not 100% foolproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does make one error in about every
billion or so bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is important to remember that
mutations will naturally be occurring,
[SPEAKER_00]: but hopefully they occur in a non-coding
region of the DNA so there's not any
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of negative effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's using that template strand there
to go through and build that new strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now DNA copying itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully now this is making a little bit
more sense here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see some of those same images.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can only bind and strain in the five to
three prime direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that polymerase can only work in
the five to three prime direction
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating this is our leading strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is made continuously with one RNA
primer and goes right along.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lagging strand here, because it's
starting and detaching and restarting and
[SPEAKER_00]: restarting, those are the lagging strand
and that has those okazaki fragments and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's created and needs multiple primers
because here it started and it worked its
[SPEAKER_00]: way to the end and it has to rebind here
and rebind here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well now helicase is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once this finishes detaching here,
it's going to come back through and create
[SPEAKER_00]: another fragment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because it can only work in the
five to three prime direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it does five to three prime,
no problem, because as helicase is
[SPEAKER_00]: separating, it's got a three prime end
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's adding the next nucleotide,
adding the next nucleotide, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this side a little bit more of these
fragments and ligase will be needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: come in and bind those together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how nucleotides are added in that five
to three prime direction, they're only
[SPEAKER_00]: added to that three prime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember they can only be added to that
three prime end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see that three prime end is
where they can be added and built going on
[SPEAKER_00]: this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going away from the replication
fork and that's why this is our lagging
[SPEAKER_00]: strand and creating okazaki fragments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens at the lagging strand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well okazaki saw one strand made
continuously, termed that the leading
[SPEAKER_00]: strand, and then the other is that lagging
strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's these discontinuous little pieces
known as these okazaki fragments,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least initially during the replication
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: During that replication process,
since DNA plants only works in that five
[SPEAKER_00]: to three prime direction, continuous
leading strand is synthesized and this
[SPEAKER_00]: discontinuous lagging strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore we need DNA ligase to splice
together these short segments to create a
[SPEAKER_00]: continuous strand of DNA at the end
result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's that ligase going right through
and just binding them all together,
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure everything's nicely fit
together and stable so that we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: any breakage of the DNA in the new really
replicated sequence here.
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA primer is removed and replaced with
that DNA to help bind everything together
[SPEAKER_00]: so that there's no evidence of what strand
was the leading and lagging strand at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ligase is the one that joins those
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is, remember, those mechanisms
for proofreading the DNA to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of there being errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one occurs about every billion bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of that DNA replication, new tumors are
added which are at the very end caps,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of at the end of DNA, and they kind
of act as protective areas to those
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This end, if you think of anything,
kind of being at the end of the chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: it being damaged, this reduces the chance
of damage occurring to the central core
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a simple animation of DNA replication
we can see here, this yellow case being
[SPEAKER_00]: the key that's separating it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our leading strand going right
along in the five to three prime
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see these little okazaki fragments
being developed here going backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, everything's kind of being
put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see those phosphate groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this one's the lagging strand we
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have ligase that has to come through
and bind these together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our leading strand going right along
the way, lagging strand, binding those
[SPEAKER_00]: okazaki fragments together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, what we'll have is a full
set of DNA replication where we had one
[SPEAKER_00]: double helix strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have two.
So we have a full set of DNA replication
where we had one double helix strand.
