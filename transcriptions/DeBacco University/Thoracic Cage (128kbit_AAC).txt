[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to provide a brief
overview of the thoracic cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: See some of the main components here are
coastal cartilage, located in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sternum is that center bone here,
and then the ribs, located on the end
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with that kind of bony thorax
or rib cage, notice that the ribs are
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled one through 12, starting at the
top here, and working your way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that sternum.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the sternum is called the
xiphoid process, that's the little portion
[SPEAKER_00]: sticking out down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a zoomed in version here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the superior and inferior
orientation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should help you if you understand
these terms, the orientation of the bone
[SPEAKER_00]: in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the sternum or body of that
sternum here is located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus a little bit more on the ribs and
the cartilage and how these interrelate
[SPEAKER_00]: and how we can identify different types of
ribs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's three main classifications of
ribs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's true and also called fixed ribs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are indicated in red here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are rib pairs that are directly or
indirectly attached to the sternum,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a direct attachment, and here's
kind of indirectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This white region here is actually
cartilage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see each is individually connected to
the sternum.
[SPEAKER_00]: False ribs are ribs eight through 12,
you see down here, and they connect to the
[SPEAKER_00]: sternum indirectly via coastal cartilages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the ribs above that connect to the
sternum directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that basically means is here's our
two false ribs connecting here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this cartilage then is joined
together, and that connects directly to
[SPEAKER_00]: the sternum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're seeing a rib directly
connecting, directly connecting,
[SPEAKER_00]: directly connecting to the sternum.
[SPEAKER_00]: These false ribs are all joined together,
and we'll see that in another image,
[SPEAKER_00]: this cartilage that then joins to the
sternum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one, the floating ribs,
and those are in blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one probably should also be in blue
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It refers to the lower most, 11 and 12,
so actually this one should have a little
[SPEAKER_00]: cartilage here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so-called because they attach only
to the vertebrae in the back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not have a direct connection to
the sternum or cartilage of the sternum.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ribs are relatively small and
delicate, and they include kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: cartilage at the very tip of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give me a little bit different
orientation here?
[SPEAKER_00]: The coastal cartilage are segments of the
cartilage that connects the sternum to the
[SPEAKER_00]: ribs and helps extend the ribs into the
forward motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cartilage also contributes to the
elasticity within the walls of the thorax,
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing the chest to expand and compress
during respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here our floating ribs in the back,
and our false ribs here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these are joining and attaching
this cartilage that then attaches to the
[SPEAKER_00]: sternum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our true ribs are the ones right here,
and they're directly attaching to the
[SPEAKER_00]: sternum.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the classroom, we also have skeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to take a look at that and
see how the different ribs look and how
[SPEAKER_00]: they're oriented, and can you identify
what's a false rib, what's a floating rib,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what's a true or fixed rib.
You're welcome to take a look at that.
