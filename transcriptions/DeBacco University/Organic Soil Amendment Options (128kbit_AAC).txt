[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're looking at organic soil
amendment options such as compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: manure, peat moss, and coconut fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to mention we are focused
on soil here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are going to be amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things we're going to be adding
to that soil to change or modify its
[SPEAKER_00]: particular properties, kind of amending
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to be growing in pure
compost or pure manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'd use the term organic for this
purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to mean it contains carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So organic here is relating to or
containing carbon compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Charcoal, diamonds, and graphite all are
carbon compounds, but the method or way
[SPEAKER_00]: that those carbon atoms are organized
gives these two materials their different
[SPEAKER_00]: properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So compost, it's a term that does not
define one single amendment, but rather a
[SPEAKER_00]: broad classification of amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to ask questions to ask if
someone has compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our one is what is the base material?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if someone has compost, that's a broad
term.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost does not always mean the exact
same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So manure and leaves are common,
with leaf compost being preferred to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the likelihood of developing
excessive phosphorus in soil conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people use food scraps, leaves,
straw, grass clippings, all great
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manure can also be composted, but if you
are worried about being high in
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus, these would be manure-based
compost will raise phosphorus levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question to ask if someone has
compost is how old or is it aged?
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically older is better, with about
three plus years being the target for
[SPEAKER_00]: material that has not been professionally
managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to picture the tree of things here to
kind of give you the idea of time that
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to occur, the old books here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need that manure or compost in general
needs time to age, needs times to break
[SPEAKER_00]: down, to make those nutrients plant
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question to ask is how it's been
prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has it been a static pile?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the easiest, but takes the longest
time to produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where piles are turned,
and this is a preferred choice if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: the option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manure, as I mentioned before,
this can be a great soil amendment when
[SPEAKER_00]: used in moderation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over adding can lead to water
contamination and poor crop yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: All manure contains phosphorus,
so be aware of this and how much you're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what phosphorus actually looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you over or add areas that have
excessive phosphorus and fresh water,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get this kind of algae bloom as we
see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about it, it only occurs on a
small scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it can actually, these algae blooms
occur on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we see here with the Great Lakes areas
here from image from space, seeing the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of algae blooms, again indicative
of high levels of phosphorus runoff going
[SPEAKER_00]: into this fresh water system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have horse manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very common, typically easy to get
manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many types, while composting
process is advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The type of animal influenced the end
product, so in particular horse manure
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tends to have more weed seeds and is
often not fully composted and broken down
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, be careful, not only is it the
manure you want to consider, but also the
[SPEAKER_00]: bedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horse staples tend to use a lot of sawdust
bedding, which will actually bind up a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the nitrogen and could cause plants to
be nitrogen deficient, even though the
[SPEAKER_00]: manure itself may contain some levels of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chick manure is the hottest, which means
it has the most nutrient dense manure in a
[SPEAKER_00]: general sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little goes a long way with chick
manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful because it can have a very
strong odor that is very unpleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're used to getting, for example,
cow manure and applying a yard,
[SPEAKER_00]: a cubic yard to a certain area,
you will not want to also apply a cubic
[SPEAKER_00]: yard of chick manure, because this is more
nutrient dense and this is what's called
[SPEAKER_00]: hotter manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cow manure is often regarded as the number
one choice to the well balanced end
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be as you've gotten in large
quantities, spreads pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one that is very sought after
by growers for buying manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used to modify their field
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clay pellets are another kind of amendment
you can add to soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clay is cooked under high pressure,
causing it to expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It drains well, holds roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The combination of air and nutrient
solutions can be used, but should be
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilized between usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see here's a plant growing
into pure clay pellets, maybe used to help
[SPEAKER_00]: aerate certain soil conditions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically not used on the large scale,
but one that is commonly used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I should mention it for some
of its advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat moss is very commonly found in media
mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It retains water well and is ability to
absorb 15 to 30 times its own weight in
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the material itself contains no
nutrients for the crop, it can affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient availability and also be a soil
acidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically lime is incorporated and we need
to add in high peat moss based growing
[SPEAKER_00]: media due to its tendency to lower the pH
or make it a more acidic environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the bogs and kind of what they
look like here and this is what the end
[SPEAKER_00]: product is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coconut fiber is a product of the
chocolate industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many growers really like coconut based
materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, quality cow mag supplement is
needed for if grown in coconut fibers,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as this cow mag here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's typically the fiber that's used,
not the actual shells, but it's separated
[SPEAKER_00]: out and provides this kind of growing
media base.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a peat moss debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about peat moss and
coconut fiber, some believe, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: should peat moss be harvested?
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% of the peat moss used in the United
States comes from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's approximately 0.2% of the 270 million
acres of Canadian peat bogs being used for
[SPEAKER_00]: peat mining.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are efforts made to kind of restore
those peat logs after they're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested, but some are believing that the
result may not be as it once was in its
[SPEAKER_00]: natural state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many peat companies are aware of this and
it's a highly debated topic and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at maintaining sustainability of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this compressed bale here and
it is a product of Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: They provide this link down here for some
more information if you want to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: peat versus coco coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at those two,
there's no clear winner between one being
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily better than the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat moss is a more consistent product and
also has existing microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa can be highly variable, making it
hard to plan and know what you're working
[SPEAKER_00]: with from delivery to delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, growers have grown in both just
fine as amendments, but you want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: mindful that coco coir can be highly
variable, one batch to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
