[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tabaco University video,
we're going to look at the threat of spray
[SPEAKER_00]: damage to your cannabis plants and how you
can kind of factor should be aware of and
[SPEAKER_00]: how you can avoid this potential issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at the threat of
spray damage to cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, sometimes good intentions can
lead to damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when applying anything to plants,
be sure it's worthwhile and that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: always risk of damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make applications at times of low light
and reduce plant stress to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of damaging the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not make applications because you think
the plant needs something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be product specific and spray with a
purpose, meaning spray with something you
[SPEAKER_00]: know the plants need for a given reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just kind of like, I think they
need this, that risk to reward factor is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely in the chance greater of risk
than reward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some sources of plant damage?
[SPEAKER_00]: So while many products can be mixed,
sometimes interactions can occur and this
[SPEAKER_00]: can result in two products that are not
damaging on their own can have
[SPEAKER_00]: phytotoxicity when they are mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes this can be seen upon immediate
mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the container before you go
and apply it, other times it's only when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be mindful of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be cautious with any new mixes and
materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to read the label of both
manufacturers product for any possible
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions and warnings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also be mindful of the method of
application, whether it's a low pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: mister here or high pressure gas powered
mister.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great for fogging an area,
but if the plants are too close,
[SPEAKER_00]: this could also cause some physical damage
to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using a spreader sticker to your
applications?
[SPEAKER_00]: Spreader stickers are great additions to
help coat the leaf surface and increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the effectiveness of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a little goes a long way with
these items, so do not over add them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also with the increase in product to the
plant surface interaction, this can
[SPEAKER_00]: improve efficiency of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when in doubt, go with the lower range
of concentrations if one is provided by
[SPEAKER_00]: the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the manufacturer gives you a range,
I'll apply this from this rate to this
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're utilizing a spreader sticker,
you might be able to favor that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: lower end of the range to not only use
less product, use less potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination, but still get the same
effectiveness because you'll get a better
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we can see an area where really
spreader sticker really isn't used because
[SPEAKER_00]: all the water is in distinct droplets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spreader sticker will cause it to kind of
form a sheet of water over the entire leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: surface, improving the interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that method of application I hinted to
earlier, when applying products to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, a force spray application can
increase the likelihood of damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mist blowers, as I showed you earlier,
are great for large operations,
[SPEAKER_00]: but be sure the true force of the air
blast is not applied directly to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stand back several feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: A mist of material is all that's needed,
so position the application to minimize
[SPEAKER_00]: potential plant damage by physically
forcing that application onto the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you want to watch out for young plant
parts just in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: When making an application, you may want
to avoid the newest growing portions of a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant as these are not fully expanded and
will likely be the most sensitive to spray
[SPEAKER_00]: products and will likely become damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damaging new plant growth has also
long-term negative impacts on plant
[SPEAKER_00]: performance because you could be damaging
your apical growing meristem or your side
[SPEAKER_00]: branches, reducing the amount of plant
material you're going to get as you would
[SPEAKER_00]: expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lastly, spraying during flowering,
the flowering phase that we can see right
[SPEAKER_00]: here, while you should be careful at any
time you're making applications to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, during the flowering phase
warrants extra caution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Late season spraying can increase the
likelihood of plants failing inspection
[SPEAKER_00]: for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you don't want to negatively impact
your final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while not advised, it can be done just
with even more caution than during other
[SPEAKER_00]: stages of plant development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, be mindful what you're spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray with a purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful of your application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure in the end you're doing more
benefits to the plant than potential risk
[SPEAKER_00]: or harm to the plant.
