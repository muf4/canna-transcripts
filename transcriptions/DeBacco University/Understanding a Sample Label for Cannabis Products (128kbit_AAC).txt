[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever looked at a product label of
cannabis and wondered what all those
[SPEAKER_00]: information is telling you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well this tobacco university video will go
through and break down a label To help you
[SPEAKER_00]: understand all the nuances that the
information that the label can provide you
[SPEAKER_00]: with All right, let's get into
understanding a sample label for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: products now they all may look slightly
different some may look like this We're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go over one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit more Kind of what you
typically would see on the outside
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off we're looking at a sales page
So this may be what you see on a website
[SPEAKER_00]: page and it provides you with some of the
general information You can see right here
[SPEAKER_00]: about the product that serves best for
comparisons to other available products
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of what the cost is is it in stock
how much in this case THC levels THCA
[SPEAKER_00]: levels Kind of that little comparison
there bring it into a little bit more of
[SPEAKER_00]: the details Of the actual label that might
be on a product like this So that website
[SPEAKER_00]: information there are often used for the
initial selection process But then once
[SPEAKER_00]: you go through and have that selection you
might be getting a product label What does
[SPEAKER_00]: that product label actually going to tell
you?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's just an example of a product
label.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see this one Clearly kind of
evident here and labeled with different
[SPEAKER_00]: parts We're going to go through and break
down each of these 15 individual parts in
[SPEAKER_00]: more detail But this is an example of this
kind of a label may look like And there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of information that is presented in
a very small space very efficiently if you
[SPEAKER_00]: know how to read it So starting here with
number one there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well number one is the CT Pharma logo So
this product is produced by CT Pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is their logo right here It's always
advised to have some company advertising
[SPEAKER_00]: as you want consumer recognition for your
product The intention is to have them
[SPEAKER_00]: associate the consumers associate your
company with a quality product And that's
[SPEAKER_00]: why that's kind of like top and center
Moving our way down the label to number
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is read to the strain name and also
the product name So in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is actually being purchased in this
case?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at a dry flower example This
does apply to other cannabis related
[SPEAKER_00]: products as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is referring to a dry flower example
So now we can get into working our way
[SPEAKER_00]: down to number three here We have the
product potency and this T 32% here refers
[SPEAKER_00]: to the product having 32% THC and that be
officially confirmed Lab test and we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: talk a little bit more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's ways to visually inspect flowers
and visually compare flowers This is
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the actual percent of THC
generated from the third-party lab Working
[SPEAKER_00]: way down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a color bar indicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't necessarily an industry
standard, but for the CT Pharma here
[SPEAKER_00]: indica It's gonna be a purple color sativa
and orange and a hybrid is going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: green color Makes it really easy for quick
comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's not necessarily an industry
standard Don't think just because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: buying something else that has this kind
of orange color That it must be a sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: versus a green the blue and so the colors
in this example for this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: company This is what they represent
Working away a little further down number
[SPEAKER_00]: five type and approximate potency So while
many consumers will look at and while
[SPEAKER_00]: important you should be looking at more
than just this more than just oh It's a
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa there at thirty one point nine
three percent THC You need to be looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at getting into even more detail on there
But it does provide you there just you
[SPEAKER_00]: have some idea of what you're purchasing
You can see in other labels to Kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: their method of organization might be a
little bit different But this is a nicely
[SPEAKER_00]: outlined label right here going number six
We have the date tested and so the
[SPEAKER_00]: approximate date that the product was
tested by a state approved laboratory So
[SPEAKER_00]: we can see here definitely says dates
tested and it gives you the date right
[SPEAKER_00]: here with the month the day followed by
the year Then we have the lot number so
[SPEAKER_00]: number seven here lot number the lot
number is a combination of four numeric
[SPEAKER_00]: digits that are given to A group of
products that were manufactured in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same batch there, so they might be unique
different lot numbers So I see with
[SPEAKER_00]: different products, so I don't think it's
only 80 canvas a lot of times You're
[SPEAKER_00]: picking up here a candy bar could see lot
numbers also provided on that packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into the NDC or the national
drug code four digit national drug code is
[SPEAKER_00]: signed to the product Here's a link if you
want the directory and when we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at number eight here the NDC the numbers
given right here and that product code a
[SPEAKER_00]: national drug code I should say Applies to
a variety of other products as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just cannabis here in this
case We're looking at zero five zero one
[SPEAKER_00]: five zero being the product code for Advil
there So again just kind of makes it that
[SPEAKER_00]: nice way to have that comparison and that
standardization all part of the required
[SPEAKER_00]: labeling process Moving on to number nine
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the quantity and that refers to
the amount of product per unit So in this
[SPEAKER_00]: case we're looking at three point five
grams You want to have an idea of just how
[SPEAKER_00]: much product would be it contained in this
particular package?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going around here below here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the expiration date.
[SPEAKER_00]: So approximate date That the state
approved laboratory deems the product
[SPEAKER_00]: expired.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at that kind of
representative sample here Looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: giving about a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have that January 15 2021 the
expiration date of this product is listed
[SPEAKER_00]: as January 15th 2022 what before its
expiration dates such as milk and other
[SPEAKER_00]: products as well also present here on the
cannabis example Here if we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of We're working way down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the contaminant testing So it's
confirmation that the product has passed
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbiological test by the state
laboratory as well as Microtoxins heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals chemical residues here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see all passed now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to see on the label But we also
want to be confirming this on the
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical report 12 is a CT pharma
contact information So when we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at kind of what's who was manufactured it
where they located It's good to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: company puts their contact information on
the label that they're willing to stand
[SPEAKER_00]: behind their product So that's a great
thing to see it's listed right here Then
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cannabinoid content and number 13
kind of little box right here percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: of each cannabinoid found in the product
There you list as percentages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others may do little color bars and bark
like a bar graph For comparison,
[SPEAKER_00]: but here we just see them stated as
percents The terpenes located up here
[SPEAKER_00]: again some go graphical here We're just
seeing the numbers percentage for each
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene found in the product as well as
the total terpene percentage Right here in
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular flower Unless we have the
QR code simply scan a QR code with your
[SPEAKER_00]: smartphone It will bring you to the
product page and or analytical report So
[SPEAKER_00]: they mentioned that analytical report very
important there because that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: original document that these numbers were
generated from In this analytical report.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's why are they so important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they provide you with information
regarding the actual test results
[SPEAKER_00]: including the lab the dates and the lot
number It's kind of like the official kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of paperwork, which hopefully the numbers
From the label were generated from you can
[SPEAKER_00]: confirm that also you can confirm what lab
they were using What license number lot
[SPEAKER_00]: number and if you had any questions You
could contact the lab with this
[SPEAKER_00]: information and make sure that they can
confirm That they definitely did test the
[SPEAKER_00]: product that you have that for just a
great way to be an informed consumer Check
[SPEAKER_00]: and balances is a great thing and this way
you can ensure you're getting a product
[SPEAKER_00]: That is of known tested basis for the
numbers that you see represented on that
[SPEAKER_00]: label You You
