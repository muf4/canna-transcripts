[SPEAKER_01]: On this Debaco University video,
we'll be learning about what UV light is
[SPEAKER_01]: and looking at some data that it has on
the impact on terpene production through
[SPEAKER_01]: this collaboration with Shane from MIGRO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome again, Shane from MIGRO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we are discussing light in different
wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about kind of in the middle,
we've talked about PAR, we've talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: blue, red, and green wavelengths of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also another video on far red,
which is one end of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're going to go to kind of the other
end of the electromagnetic spectrum,
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about UV light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now with UV light, we've got the breakdown
of UVA and UVB, and we're going to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: see can we disertain anything about,
you know, how it might affect plant
[SPEAKER_01]: growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do plants kind of utilize these?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of looking at that far end,
you know, one spectrum, that far red,
[SPEAKER_01]: well now does this have any counteracting
effects?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or when we're looking at UV light,
how may this change our morphology?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we may see it in some lights that
we're looking at purchasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Shane, looking at our UVA and UVB
lights, how's this impacting plant growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: What can growers kind of expect for these
different wavelengths?
[SPEAKER_01]: To impact their particular plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so UVA is lower wavelength than
blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a deep blue, just about
visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're to see a UVA LED, you might see
sort of a deep blue glow from it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but barely in the visible range.
[SPEAKER_00]: UVA is emitted by the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's available to use by plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's somewhat photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although not as photosynthetic as blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you go into the lower wavelengths,
it becomes less photosynthetically active.
[SPEAKER_00]: UVA in terms of plant response is very
similar to blue in that increased
[SPEAKER_00]: proportions of UVA in the plant spectrum
will lead to shorter, more dense growth up
[SPEAKER_00]: to a point.
[SPEAKER_00]: UVA is not considered to be better
beneficial in many other ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are studies around theories abound,
but I haven't seen any practical
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstration or experiments demonstrating
that there's any other benefit of using
[SPEAKER_00]: UVA in terms of cannabis growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Separately then, UVB, which is lower down
on the spectrum, sorry, lower down in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of wavelengths, shorter wavelength,
but higher energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know this because UVB causes sunburn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has high energy photons, which can
basically damage cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in terms of ourselves, we get
sunburned.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of plants, it can reduce growth
rate because it can damage the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it can also stimulate a response from
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are theories that UVB will
contribute to increased oil production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The so-called sunscreen response.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some evidence to support this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if you talk to herb
growers, there's just considered to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: qualitative difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, rosemary, if it's grown
in the sun rather than in the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a more pungent, sticky aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some studies very limited
with regard to cannabis that you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: that effect also.
[SPEAKER_00]: The theory being that you'd apply UVB to
the plant when flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, you get increased not in
cannabinoids, but an increase in oil
[SPEAKER_00]: production, which would be terpenes and
flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more flavor and taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks for mentioning the specifics of
timing potentially of this and how that
[SPEAKER_01]: might be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some manufacturers are producing specific
lights for UVB in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you mentioned, more towards that end,
that terpene, that final kind of finishing
[SPEAKER_01]: where it might be more important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, is this something growers should be
filtering out maybe early in the season?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is something that you would look at
modifying in any certain way, any
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations you would give to growers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you just use it at the end?
[SPEAKER_01]: And does it really matter because we're
looking at blue light, UV light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this something growers should be
concerned about the entire grow or should
[SPEAKER_01]: it really be focused on in that later
stages, if at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So UVB or UVA to start with is not
produced by grow lighting or a standard
[SPEAKER_00]: grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're using white LED lights,
for example, even using metal halide and
[SPEAKER_00]: high pressure sodium, a very limited
output of UVA from those lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some growers choose to supplement that
spectrum with perhaps UVA dials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, that might be producing a
small amount of UVA radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's likely to contribute a little
bit to photosynthesis, but unlikely to
[SPEAKER_00]: change the quality of the harvest that you
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And UVB up to now has only really been
available using fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your typical use would be in sun beds
or reptile bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they are quite an efficient source of
UVB photons and they can be used as a
[SPEAKER_00]: supplemental light to your LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an improvement in the UVB LED
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're becoming more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're becoming more cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are studies that are underway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know from speaking to a college recently
that they're looking at discrete bands,
[SPEAKER_00]: the effect of discrete bands of UVB on the
terpian profile, for example, of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's plenty to be looked at there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's research to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure there'll be learnings that
will come out over the coming years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for giving us that little teaser
insight to what we might be seeing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that just because we can
produce it or can add it, it may not have
[SPEAKER_01]: necessary effects on plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of that technology versus
morphology of the plant and kind of what
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant can actually utilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just kind of adds to our
understanding of just what the plants can
[SPEAKER_01]: utilize even though they might be exposed
to a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look forward to hearing potentially on
that research or those publications on
[SPEAKER_01]: what might be coming forward as we learn
more about this particular wavelength
[SPEAKER_01]: there that the plants can be exposed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you again, Shane, for everything
here and further insight into our
[SPEAKER_01]: ever-expanding knowledge of the
ever-expanding electromagnetic spectrum.
