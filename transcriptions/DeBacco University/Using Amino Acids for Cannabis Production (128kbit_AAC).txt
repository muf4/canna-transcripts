[SPEAKER_00]: So many growers talk about adding amino
acids to their cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a worthwhile process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here at Tobacco University, we'll answer
that very question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into using amino acids for
cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what are amino acids?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll basically start with the basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are any group of organic
molecules that consist of a basic amino
[SPEAKER_00]: group, an acidic carboxyl group,
and an organic R group or side chain its
[SPEAKER_00]: variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is unique to each amino acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see them listed, the 21 listed
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The remaining two bonds of the alpha
carbon atom are generally testified by
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen atoms and R group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that kind of this amino
group here, what defines the different
[SPEAKER_00]: amino acids is kind of this side chain
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see some are electrically charged
side chains, some of the positive charge,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the negative charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have uncharged side chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are special cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have hydrophobic, sorry, side chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these must be taken into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what causes amino acids to make up
proteins that gives proteins their unique
[SPEAKER_00]: shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a reference article looking at
some applications of amino acids to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve yield in lettuce by enhancing
photosynthesis and nutrient availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna relate this to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So amino acids study conclusions here,
looking at the lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be inferred that the L,
and that's just a form, methionine,
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the chlorophyll concentration of
plants and contributes to the saving of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy, thus boosting plant yield in
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also led to significant increases in
observed physiological factors in lettuce
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves and lower concentrations because of
that high concentrations, it affects
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen uptake, which can kill plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is again, where dosing is a very
important parameter to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: More is not better.
[SPEAKER_00]: In brief, looking at the lettuce,
the L-methionine at concentrations of 0.2
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams per liter showed the best
effect on the growth of lettuce plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does this kind of relate to
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if we're looking back through,
how can it relate to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, applying a general amino acid
product may have limiting benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, indicate that specific amino
acids needs to be studied, that there only
[SPEAKER_00]: may be a limited number that could show
plant benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just adding amino acids isn't really gonna
help plants per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be some specific ones that may
have direct application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the application rates are another
important consideration since higher rates
[SPEAKER_00]: have been shown to have impacts on plant
hormone pathways that could result in
[SPEAKER_00]: plant death or at least negative impacts
on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to use them,
amino acids, do so carefully and in
[SPEAKER_00]: moderation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And observe the plant to see if you're
actually getting a benefit or a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always good to run a control, which is one
that would not have amino acids,
[SPEAKER_00]: to see if there are any visual differences
or morphological differences to determine
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's worth the extra expense of
adding amino acids to your cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for watching.
