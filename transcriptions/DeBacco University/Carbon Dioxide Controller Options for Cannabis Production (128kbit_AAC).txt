[SPEAKER_00]: Here on DeBaco University, I'm going to
show you the three main controller options
[SPEAKER_00]: when enriching your area with carbon
dioxide and provide you with the
[SPEAKER_00]: advantages and disadvantages of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go over carbon dioxide controller
options for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we have the time to release
carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see an example of one right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage is that this is very easy to
set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know exactly when you will need to
refill or replace the bottle because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to come on for a set duration of
time and off for a set duration of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We noticed about this one, it also has a
photo cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will ensure that this cycle will
only repeat when the light's on or when
[SPEAKER_00]: the sunlight is out, which is when plants
will utilize carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages with the setup
is it's not reactive to the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to inject CO2 for the X amount
of time, regardless of whether it needs it
[SPEAKER_00]: or whether it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could cause elevated levels and waste
carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while the timer itself might be
relatively inexpensive, you typically will
[SPEAKER_00]: be spending more in wasted carbon dioxide
over a growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now controller without fuzzy logic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the advantages is that it's less
expensive than one that would have fuzzy
[SPEAKER_00]: logic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can work with bottle-based or
heat-based carbon dioxide sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the advantage of using a
controller of this type.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantages is it can waste carbon
dioxide, particularly if you're using the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growth space may have a greater
variability in carbon dioxide levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that if you are using a
heat-based source, you cannot use fuzzy
[SPEAKER_00]: logic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuzzy logic, there's other videos on that,
where you're able to kind of, the
[SPEAKER_00]: controller helps regulate and determine
what dosing duration and frequency it
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But using heat-based sources, you can get
away with a controller that does not have
[SPEAKER_00]: the fuzzy logic option.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here also a light sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are using a compressed bottle
system, you probably want to look at our
[SPEAKER_00]: third type here, which is a controller
with fuzzy logic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply because the advantages is that this
is a computer-based adjustment to match
[SPEAKER_00]: your particular growing space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way for the controller to
kind of learn your growth space and help
[SPEAKER_00]: dial in the carbon dioxide dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is it does have the most
upfront costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cannot be used with a burner or heater
style carbon dioxide generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can only be used with bottle-based
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this computer-based adjustments
that go on allow you to minimize the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of wasted carbon dioxide you'd be
using with a bottle system and make your
[SPEAKER_00]: overall carbon dioxide enrichment
environment as efficient as it can be,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when using compressed bottles.
