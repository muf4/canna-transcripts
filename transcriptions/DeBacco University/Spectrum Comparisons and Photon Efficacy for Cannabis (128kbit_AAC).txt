[SPEAKER_00]: On this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to go over spectrum comparisons
[SPEAKER_00]: and photon efficacy for cannabis
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to give you some comparisons between
different spectrum produced by common
[SPEAKER_00]: light sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into spectrum
comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look just at the title slide here,
looking at a regular day, dawn,
[SPEAKER_00]: midday, and dusk, we can see how the
overall wavelengths and intensities can
[SPEAKER_00]: change throughout just a single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to focus on something a
little more consistent indoor lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I have a good reference
article here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested and want some more
information, definitely recommend you
[SPEAKER_00]: check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do some links and the
proper citations here so you can go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and read the details if you want
for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to provide a summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at photon efficacy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that photon efficacy of HPS lights is
about 1.7 to allow you for that general
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here to the numbers provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare that to the red LED chips,
which are 2.6 times the efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at LED kind of red here at
4.5, HPS lights are only about 1.7 for
[SPEAKER_00]: that comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conversion of efficiency of photons
efficacy depends on spectral distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be aware of exactly what
wavelengths are being produced by that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant action spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant action spectra associated with
the primary classes of photosensitive
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Action spectrum for the cryptochromes are
not yet well established.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be aware we have chlorophyll A and
chlorophyll B.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most people are probably familiar
with at least hearing those terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see here we can have a very
strong absorbance down in that bluish kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another peak over here where
we're getting closer to that orange or red
[SPEAKER_00]: areas there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are measured in wavelengths,
which we'll see in future slides here on
[SPEAKER_00]: this presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, when we're talking about
light in general, I thought this picture
[SPEAKER_00]: was kind of interesting just to show light
pollution on a soybean crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're looking at the kind of soybean
field here and we're seeing a roadway,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're noticing these like dark green kind
of like little almost like bubble areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll notice those correlate with
street lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this shows a great visual of how light
pollution or light can impact plants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see this again on a soybean field,
which is the street lights impact on some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the green coloration we see in this
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at metal halides to HPS flip
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will grow in a metal halide,
the veg, and then flip over when they go
[SPEAKER_00]: to the flowering stage, go to high
pressure sodiums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's usually a metal halide for 18
hour days and high pressure sodium flour
[SPEAKER_00]: for 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metal halides have about 30% blue to keep
plants short with tight internodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS only has about 4% blue, but it's still
a very efficient light because of the red
[SPEAKER_00]: orange spectrum it produces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green photons are important for visual
disease diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a source of comparison,
sunlight does have about 30% blue light in
[SPEAKER_00]: it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, those kind of pictures,
graphs that we'll see here, here we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at a sunlight spectrum just to
kind of give you an idea, looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly that PAR range, UVB, UVA,
FAR red, and kind of the ROYGBIV spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: here for light frequency produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a one to 30 UVB to UVA ratio for
sunlight spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to high pressure sodium
spectrum, we're noticing just if we go
[SPEAKER_00]: back and forth for just a couple seconds,
here's sunlight, here's high pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium, back and forth, we're seeing a
massive change here in the amount of light
[SPEAKER_00]: frequency that's produced by the high
pressure sodium spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also have some grow light
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are white LEDs producing 3,500
Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, to give you just that comparison of
what spectrum is being produced by some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these lights, but you should always be
checking with your specific light bulb or
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer should be able to provide you
with one of these spectrum graphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also in addition, if you're not aware
of, there's something called the DLC,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the Design Light Consortium for
light efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an independent company that lists
many lights from different manufacturers
[SPEAKER_00]: and publish test results for the
efficiencies of lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.5 and greater micromoles per joule is
considered to be a very efficient light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of a nonprofit
organization that can help kind of provide
[SPEAKER_00]: you with some more details and information
potentially about lights that you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: considering purchasing so you make the
best selection for your grow area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, as always, if you want to learn
more, I've provided you with some great
[SPEAKER_00]: names here to go through, take a look,
special thanks to them and the research,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, that they've done to contribute
to the information presented here and
[SPEAKER_00]: research all over so you can hopefully
become an informed consumer when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at purchasing lights.
