[SPEAKER_00]: On this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to go over using electricity to
[SPEAKER_00]: heat a cannabis grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, if you're thinking about using
electrical heat to heat your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, let's go over some of the
details you should be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, the advantages of using
electric heat, there's low installation
[SPEAKER_00]: cost, there's dependability with electric
heat, it's application flexible,
[SPEAKER_00]: quiet operation, low maintenance,
and easy to service.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these sound like great advantages
for electric heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple to connect to a power supply,
there's usually power in the facility
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do have to be careful about the wattage
requirements of your size of your heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dependability, there's really no moving
parts, so that's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be air deflector blades
installed to help control airflow over the
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, over the area within the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quiet operation, so you're not dealing
with any really loud noises.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low maintenance because the motors are
totally enclosed, thermally protected,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fan motor exposed usually for easy
access if needed to be accessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the electric heat for individual grow
rooms, for individual rooms themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having nearly instant heat in a grow space
is advantageous to prevent the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: from dipping too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: This type of heat source can also allow
for specific temperature targets to be
[SPEAKER_00]: varied room to room with different
thermostats based on different sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could really want to allow a
grower to dial in the heat in different
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms and also try to minimize the cost of
heating those individual rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to check to be sure though when
you are going through and considering
[SPEAKER_00]: electric heat to make sure that the
electrical system can handle the addition
[SPEAKER_00]: of an electric heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always consider the worst case scenario
and that's where all of your electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: systems are running at the same time,
even though that may not be the intention.
[SPEAKER_00]: This includes your lights, your pumps,
your fans, and any addition to the heater
[SPEAKER_00]: that you may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have what's going on
looks like here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just start plugging everything in and
if that works, let me try something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's still working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me try something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be mindful of exactly how much
amps your system is drawing and what
[SPEAKER_00]: breaker system you have everything hooked
up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly is again that word of caution
because we are talking about a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within grow rooms, there's always water of
some kind around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be sure to take extra precautions
to make sure that it's kept isolated in a
[SPEAKER_00]: way from areas where electrical heat is in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heaters tend to be large consumers
electricity to make sure they do not come
[SPEAKER_00]: in contact with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure there's distinct isolation and
separation so you're providing the
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficient heat that the grow facility
needs with the proper safety precautions
[SPEAKER_00]: in place for both the plants as well as
the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
