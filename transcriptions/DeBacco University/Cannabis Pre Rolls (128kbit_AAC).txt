[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanted to learn more about
pre-rolls in the form that are made from
[SPEAKER_00]: derived from cannabis, this Tobacco
University video is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over cannabis
pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to thank CT Pharma here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They provide some great information about
some products that they produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also publicly available information
about their analytical reports,
[SPEAKER_00]: their labels and products they produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: The descriptions and opinions and uses
have intended to provide an understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: of some of the end products of the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're going to be looking at
pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just what is a pre-roll?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's premium flour that's ground and
basically sifted to uniform size and
[SPEAKER_00]: lightly packed into an unbleached hemp
paper cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is ready to go, easily accessible
experience as we can see pictured right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside there is basically these buds that
are just been finely ground and sifted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it fits in that nice neat little
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are some options when it comes to
pre-rolls?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they come in many different sizes
and counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: CT Pharma, just to focus on them for a
moment, focus on two.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have their shorts and their regulars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some dispensaries will offer pre-rolls
packed with concentrates such as live
[SPEAKER_00]: resin and rosin and a dry sieve cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all available in the same
cultivar as premium flour because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much what they are derived from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the use of pre-rolls, just in general,
when we're talking about pre-rolls,
[SPEAKER_00]: they get their name states.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already rolled for the consumer,
which allows for no additional
[SPEAKER_00]: preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pre-rolls can be lit and smoked
for immediate on-the-go relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: The small price tag and quick use of
pre-rolls make them widely used for trying
[SPEAKER_00]: out new cultivars, particularly these
smaller pre-rolls there if they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: try something that offers a great quick
and easy option for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're looking at dry floured in
general, we want to be mindful of
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical reports here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are just some of the pages here
looking at our analytical reports,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at some of the total yeast and
mold counts, the microbial counts,
[SPEAKER_00]: the chloroform counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are necessarily tests that need to
be performed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while, again, a lot of people focus on
the cannabinoids and the terpenes for good
[SPEAKER_00]: reason, we also need to be mindful that
these products should have been tested for
[SPEAKER_00]: and should have passed and should have
documentation to match laboratory reports
[SPEAKER_00]: and lot numbers with anything you're
looking at purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of people look at the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, it does say all tests
passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does make it nice and easy to view.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can also or should be also
checking the analytical reports as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to confirm that and have that area of
documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any good company will have the label,
but also have the other paperwork to back
[SPEAKER_00]: up their claims on the label.
