[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video
entitled Identifying a White Powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in this video we're going to be
looking at an unknown white powder and
[SPEAKER_00]: some procedures and tests that can be done
to work towards identifying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at a disclaimer here
that we'll be identifying in this example
[SPEAKER_00]: some common household items.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those common household items I've
listed here again everything from table
[SPEAKER_00]: salt, baking soda, table sugar,
but I want you to realize that these same
[SPEAKER_00]: concepts can be applied to items that have
increased toxicity levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind that while the substances
themselves are unknown and they might be
[SPEAKER_00]: just simple household items we have lying
around just remember all laboratory safety
[SPEAKER_00]: procedures should be followed because we
don't know what the substance is and also
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the reagents used might have
increasing toxicity levels themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So treat everything as dangerous and
you'll be plenty safe following all the
[SPEAKER_00]: proper safety procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at again focusing on our
household items here one common test that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be done is simply solubility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solubility is a chemical property
referring to the ability of a given
[SPEAKER_00]: substance the solute to dissolve in a
solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: How well does it essentially dissolve?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's measured in terms of the maximum
amount of solute dissolved in a solvent at
[SPEAKER_00]: equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much for example if we're looking
at water and we'll say simple table sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: how much sugar can you put in that water
before you start to get a it falls out of
[SPEAKER_00]: solution how much can it suspend in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's its solubility?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a water solubility test for example
water solubility is one of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: important and frequently used physical
chemical properties of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This test to see if the substance is polar
meaning it will dissolve or non-polar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extreme example would be oil and salt
for example oil won't dissolve in water
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's non-polar salt is an ionic
compound it is polar and therefore it will
[SPEAKER_00]: dissolve quite well in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to add about a quarter of a gram
of a sample to a test tube and then add
[SPEAKER_00]: about five mils of water and stop her and
shake that test tube and then a judgment
[SPEAKER_00]: will have to be determined whether the
solid does or does not completely dissolve
[SPEAKER_00]: in that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again the solubility test is a great
quick little test you can perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into hydrochloric acid
solubility.
[SPEAKER_00]: This follows the same concept as water
solubility but for some of the items
[SPEAKER_00]: listed here's a few there are a few hints
by carbonates and carbonates react with
[SPEAKER_00]: acid to form carbon dioxide and bubbles
will form calcium sulfate in in cornstarch
[SPEAKER_00]: are not soluble in 10% hydrochloric acid
so that's kind of a little bit of a hint
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of the powders are soluble at
least the ones listed in those household
[SPEAKER_00]: items list so this gives you an indication
for at least an initial step for
[SPEAKER_00]: classifying what white powder you might be
dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have vinegar so bicarbonates and
carbonates react with the acetic acid
[SPEAKER_00]: which is basically the acid in vinegar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vinegar is 5% acetic acid and they'll form
carbon dioxide bubbles as we see here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the image in the beaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same as 10% hydrochloric acid
test so again I want to typically do
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple tests to confirm what a substance
we might have as an unknown white powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the iodine test so starches for
example react with iodine to form a blue
[SPEAKER_00]: complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still want to use about that quarter
gram of powder that you suspect to be
[SPEAKER_00]: cornstarch in a test tube at two drops of
a tincture of iodine which is a solution
[SPEAKER_00]: of iodine dissolved in alcohol to the test
tube in a few drops of water and mix the
[SPEAKER_00]: contents and note the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's kind of a yellow orange to be a
negative and if it's a purple black that
[SPEAKER_00]: would be kind of a positive test there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to iron nitrate test so here we're
going to transfer about five drops of the
[SPEAKER_00]: substances that were in the water soluble
well plate test.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to use those same components
from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Place a drop or two of the iron nitrate
solution in each test well indicate a
[SPEAKER_00]: purple which is a positive coloration we
see continue here or a light brown orange
[SPEAKER_00]: would be a negative coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that purple if it's well lit you can
see that deep purple color however it
[SPEAKER_00]: could almost look black if or if depending
on the lighting so keep in mind this would
[SPEAKER_00]: be an example again of a positive and a
negative test.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have it lit well you'll have that
nice kind of deep purple color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the sodium hydroxide or NaOH test
magnesium sulfate reacts with sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroxide NaOH to form insoluble magnesium
hydroxide which is a solid precipitate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so when you use about that quarter
gram of powder you suspect is magnesium
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfate in a test tube and about five mils
of water stopper and then shake the test
[SPEAKER_00]: tube to dissolve the magnesium sulfate add
about 20 drops of the 0.2 molar sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroxide to the solution and record your
observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is again another great visual test
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting here we get a nice purple to nice
pink color of phenolphthalein test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenolphthalein is often used as an
indicator in acid-based tritrations and
[SPEAKER_00]: turns colors in acidic solutions and pink
in basic ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So note that phenolphthalein is slightly
soluble in water and usually dissolves in
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohols for the for use in experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see that example here of that
pH of 8 to 12 we definitely have that pink
[SPEAKER_00]: coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a pH here of very acidic pH that 0
to 8 very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind though above 12 we can also
kind of get a clearing of the solution as
[SPEAKER_00]: well sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be aware so that we add it as
drops and we start to see that pretty pink
[SPEAKER_00]: color.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're indicating here that we have kind of
a base going on in that test tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get a little bit more precise we can
also go to pH testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is using a universal indicator can be
used to test the pH of only water soluble
[SPEAKER_00]: substances via a color chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind that if it fails the
water solubility test the pH test is not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be one we want to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply add drops of the universal
indicator directly to the test tube of the
[SPEAKER_00]: water solubility test and record the color
and that will help indicate based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: color matching what pH you're dealing with
for those water soluble substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have Benedict's reagent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is to test for simple sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the procedure listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind Benedict's reagent does
require the solution to be added mixed and
[SPEAKER_00]: then heated in boiling water bath for
about three to five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that time you may observe a color
change of the solution or at that time is
[SPEAKER_00]: when you want to observe the potential for
a color change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have that aqua blue to kind of green
coloration that would be a negative test.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have that yellow to orange that would
be an indication of a positive test after
[SPEAKER_00]: heating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note this test cannot detect the simple
sugar sucrose so again these all do have
[SPEAKER_00]: limitations so just be mindful of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have our Biarritz reagent here and
here we're looking at the test for
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a procedure listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that we want to observe any
color change again but we want to allow
[SPEAKER_00]: this reaction to occur potentially for up
to five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a quick reaction and go look at
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to let it sit for about five
minutes and we have that kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: denim blue coloration that would be
negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have that lavender purple coloration
that would be an indication of a positive
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again hopefully this helps kind of for
the common household substances be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine what those white powders are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind to follow all laboratory
procedures stay safe even though they have
[SPEAKER_00]: a low toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these are reagents here we want to
be very careful with.
