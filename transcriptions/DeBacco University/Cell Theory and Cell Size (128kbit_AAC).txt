[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to look at a brief
overview of cell theory and comparative
[SPEAKER_00]: cell size.
[SPEAKER_00]: The image here shows scaling all the way
down to an atom in small molecules and how
[SPEAKER_00]: they rate in comparison to say a bacteria,
an animal cell, or a human hair and what
[SPEAKER_00]: lies in between those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here there's a room entry picture of
what the first image of what cells look
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting first with cell structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1655 the English scientist Robert Hooke
coined the term cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used this very rudimentary microscope
and this is the image that he saw and when
[SPEAKER_00]: he looked through there he coined the term
cells because he felt what he was looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at here looked very similar to like prison
cells and that's the term we use today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basic structure of cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all cells have this same basic
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind there's animal cells,
there's also plant cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basic structure is this flexible
plasma membrane that surrounds the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: cell and it's in both animal and also
plant cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interior, the inside, is filled with
this semi-fluid material called cytoplasm
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's true for both cell types here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside are specialized structures called
organelles and also the cell's genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll talk about more of this in other
videos but these organelles and eukaryotes
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are specialized structures that
occur in the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cell theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Detailed study of how the cell began.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 1655 was the first kind of
visualization of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's kind of a lull there in the 1830s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start to get this kind of cell theory
starting to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the unifying concept in biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It originated from work from these
scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Robert Hooke again was first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other biologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: She lighted and Schwan and Vickrow are
three other scientists that were important
[SPEAKER_00]: to develop this cell theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is a very early concept trying
to get an idea or handle what these
[SPEAKER_00]: actually structures are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of what they came up with
and it's kind of a summary here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cell theory has three components.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is all organisms are
composed of cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is again 1830s, late 1830s is
when this was kind of first came about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, all cells come from
pre-existing cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 1850s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all cells come from pre-existing cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to get a cell, it had to come
from another cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have that division process that
occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it does bring apart the question of
well, where does the first cell come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: But in theory, the cell theory here,
we're only looking at where did our cells
[SPEAKER_00]: come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they came from pre-existing cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third part of the theory is cells
are the smallest structural and functional
[SPEAKER_00]: units of organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the most simple, they're the most
basic structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can have very different amount of
cells or types of cells, but they're the
[SPEAKER_00]: smallest structural functional unit of an
organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, cells may have a nucleus,
they may have mitochondria, they may have
[SPEAKER_00]: other components in them, but the cell
itself is a small structural functional
[SPEAKER_00]: unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still composed of other things,
but that cell represents that very small
[SPEAKER_00]: functional unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organisms and cells can give you an idea
of just kind of how things kind of come
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our sperm and egg here,
very small, single-celled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go into our larger human fetus,
we're getting our kind of pluripotent
[SPEAKER_00]: cells, our massive cells, and then those
can come together to form these
[SPEAKER_00]: circulatory systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be heart tissue, nervous
systems, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's kind of a zoomed-in picture of that
original image, where we have our atoms,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have our DNA bases, our proteins are
getting a little bit bigger, viruses,
[SPEAKER_00]: are a little bigger than that,
genes are bigger than viruses,
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria are bigger than the genes,
our animal cells are bigger than that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and our human hair here would be the
largest in this scalation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just give you an idea of what things
look like in comparison to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visualizing cells, again, they're very
small, our heavy atoms here are very
[SPEAKER_00]: small, proteins are kind of the next size
up, ribosomes, viruses, prokaryotic and
[SPEAKER_00]: eukaryotic cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be separate videos on each one of
these, prokaryotic cells we could think of
[SPEAKER_00]: like bacteria, we think of them as more
rudimentary, more basic cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then eukaryotic cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the ones that contain
organelles, like defined nucleuses,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if they're a plant cell chloroplasts,
the mitochondria present, so that's our
[SPEAKER_00]: eukaryotic cells, and they're bigger for
that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this great link here where it's
coffee to carbon, it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon being the carbon atom, a very
simple, basic, small, small structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way up to coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go to this website here,
we'll take a look at it, go to next.utah
[SPEAKER_00]: .edu, gives you this idea of a coffee
bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see these little tiny things here
in a grain of rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, down here, there's a little sliding
scale up here, and we can start to zoom
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we notice the coffee bean, we're
zooming in, how big that coffee bean looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like to a grain of salt for comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: A grain of salt's quite large compared to
these things, so we can zoom in and see
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our grain of salt, we're seeing
these kind of amoebas starting to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the amoebas, our pyrimesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our human egg cell compared to a
sperm cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at our skin cell, photoreceptors,
these are in the back of our eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting smaller here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red blood cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bakers yeast, how small they are in
comparison to the X chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: See some also small things, the
mitochondria, how that looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we zoom in even further,
E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli, lysosomes, which we'll learn about
when we do organelles.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple other small things here,
different viruses here being small,
[SPEAKER_00]: HIV, influenza.
[SPEAKER_00]: But wait, there's more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hepatitis virus, ribosomes, antibodies,
tRNA, hemoglobin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it gets even smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phospholipids, glucose, adenine should
settle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an unfamiliar water molecule all the
way down to a carbon atom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the smallest form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can zoom on the way back out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a cool kind of trip going from
carbon atoms to the amino acids,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the glucose, to the phospholipids,
to the tRNA, how big the antibody looks
[SPEAKER_00]: right now in the hemoglobin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, size is a relative thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our ribosome, we'll learn about
those when we do organelles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's different types of viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This giant thing over here, well,
that is simply just a mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lysosome, E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli, chromosome, baker's yeast,
red blood cells, sperm cell, egg cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: skin cell, amoeba, grain of salt,
all the way out to a copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just kind of the neat way to be
able to look at and compare the relative
[SPEAKER_00]: size of things and how small, what certain
things are, and in the great scheme of
[SPEAKER_00]: things, how large other things can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just a nice little comparison,
looking to get you to appreciate the size
[SPEAKER_00]: and the reason why these cells need to be
so small.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to look at the surface area to
volume video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and we'll see you
next time.
