[SPEAKER_00]: Now with any growing setup, you want to be
able to monitor your conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be monitoring your conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a variety of ways you can do that,
but keep in mind that when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: monitoring conditions, you also be very
concerned with the units that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be familiar with the units
you're using, why you're using them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what they tell you, what the expected
range is for the given unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to go over some common ones
here, EC, TDS, CF, and PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is EC referring to
electro-connectivity, total dissolved
[SPEAKER_00]: solids, conductivity factor, and parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these are interchangeable terms,
like from inches to centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be, again, mindful of what you're using
and what it measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a monitor, or an example of one,
is called a Blue Lab Guardian Monitor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is an easy monitor to look at
three critical conditions all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very useful for hydroponics and for
those using easy cloners.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the connectivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can switch between parts per million,
as this is set here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also go to TDS, or EC,
or CF, because those are interchangeable
[SPEAKER_00]: terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature, you can measure it in
Fahrenheit and Celsius, and pH is a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.5 here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these nutrient concentrations,
that's basically what we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping an eye on and monitoring,
are nutrients or salts, which can be
[SPEAKER_00]: measured based on the ability to conduct
electricity through a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher the concentration, the more
conductivity, the more diluted,
[SPEAKER_00]: the less conductivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with electrical connectivity,
EC, pure water, such as reverse osmosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: has an EC of zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the mineral ions added,
the more readily the water will conduct.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, kind of sending a pulse of
electricity through to see how quickly it
[SPEAKER_00]: passes through the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: EC, if your nutrient solution is fairly
reliable, measure how much general
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients are dissolved in your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: EC is the most widely accepted measurement
for the strength of nutrient solutions and
[SPEAKER_00]: is the standard in Europe and many other
parts of the world, but typically,
[SPEAKER_00]: for whatever reason, North America tends
to like TDS, total dissolved solids,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's a couple more issues with that
one when compared to EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The total dissolved solids, I think it's
easy to understand, at least the initial
[SPEAKER_00]: name, it's the amount of solids dissolved
in solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: TDS qualifies the concentration of these
diluted solids in a given aqueous
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem, though, with TDS is that,
accurately measuring the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: solution, you really need to evaporate all
the liquid and measure the residue,
[SPEAKER_00]: which kind of goes against having a
nutrient solution in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also conversion factors and it can
get messy, so even though this is
[SPEAKER_00]: typically widely used by a lot of growers,
it may not necessarily be the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: CF, or conductive factor, is basically the
same as EC because it tells you the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how strong or how concentrated your
feed solution is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they both measure the rate of
electrical connectivity in your solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher the mineral content,
the higher the connectivity rating,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's why, if you notice back on the
left, we have the blue lab guardian,
[SPEAKER_00]: EC slash CF, that's not EC divided by CF,
that's EC or CF, both kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: interchangeable terms in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we have parts per million,
and parts per million is referring to the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of solution or minerals in
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: To put parts per million into perspective,
a 1% solution, or a 1 out of 100 solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the same solution containing 10,000
parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 1 out of 100 is the same as 10,000
out of a million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of what's here, one million black
dots or pixels, each tile with white or
[SPEAKER_00]: gray background contains 1,000 dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to give you that concept or
that idea of exactly what a million may
[SPEAKER_00]: look like.
