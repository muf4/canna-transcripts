[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, when we're looking at our
impressions here, looking at footwear,
[SPEAKER_00]: there can be two and three dimensions of
these impressions taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be kind of an inked image,
which would be a two dimension or kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: a poured cast to take advantage of the
three dimensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to cover that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the footwear analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, areas of footwear which are examined
by analysis include the design of the
[SPEAKER_00]: shoe, the physical size and shape,
the wear marks, and also individual
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying characteristics such as cuts
or tears or the gum that might be present
[SPEAKER_00]: or a nail or anything else that would be
kind of very specific to that one
[SPEAKER_00]: particular shoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now two and three dimensional impressions,
how do they differ?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at two dimensional
impressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are impressions made on tile,
lid flooring, some of the highly available
[SPEAKER_00]: surfaces, linoleum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be also latent prints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three dimensional impressions are
remaining after a shoe permanently deforms
[SPEAKER_00]: a surface found in sand, mud, or snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is an example of the two to three
dimensional impressions and both can be
[SPEAKER_00]: very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the visible prints, as we see here,
these prints are visible with no
[SPEAKER_00]: additional processes needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ones you can just kind of look down
and quote find if you know where to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be examples include soil or the
materials picked up by the shoe are
[SPEAKER_00]: deposited onto a flat hard contrasting
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a variety of surfaces and
materials deposited makes recovery from
[SPEAKER_00]: those prints very complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, whether it's something that's in
a very hard surface, a very soft surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: a heavier individual, a lighter
individual, all this is going to impact
[SPEAKER_00]: the visibility of those particular prints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have something called latent
prints.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these prints require some process to
make them visible or very difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: visualize.
[SPEAKER_00]: These latent prints examples could be very
barely visible dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's kind of in a kind of attic,
for example, hasn't been disturbed a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Impressions and polishes or wax or waxes,
those might need some additional kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: processes done to be able to make them
visible, either to be photographed or just
[SPEAKER_00]: be visible by the investigator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are latent prints.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at two dimensional
impressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once an impression has been
photographed, the print may be able to be
[SPEAKER_00]: lifted off the particular surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electric static lifting can help transfer
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fingerprint powder can be used in
combination with what's called PBS,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is polyvinylsiloxane, which is a
casting material that can be used for
[SPEAKER_00]: impressions where electrostatic lifting
may not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of this kind of example of
how we can potentially lift that print off
[SPEAKER_00]: the area to be examined in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also three dimensional
impressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this example here is where we can use
dental stone as primary method of casting
[SPEAKER_00]: footwear impressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: On wet surfaces, spray wax maybe,
we have to be used for sealing impression
[SPEAKER_00]: on off, then a mix of dental stone on site
with water and a sealable bag for about
[SPEAKER_00]: three minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the stone hardens in about 20 minutes
and about 24 to 40 hours, about a day to
[SPEAKER_00]: two days hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be fully hardened and then can be
used in stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to kind of create this
little setup, but this is pretty easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: do on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really require a lot of
materials because it's all kind of self
[SPEAKER_00]: contained.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those 3D prints, those shoe prints
made in the soft material, such as dirt or
[SPEAKER_00]: snow, the composition of the material will
determine the detail of the impression
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: This often requires making of a cast of
the print, as we can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's other types, as I said,
this dental stone, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can have a little cardboard side here
to help sit in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be a great way to help preserve
those prints to be able to be
[SPEAKER_00]: investigated, looked at, and compared and
entered as evidence at a later date.
