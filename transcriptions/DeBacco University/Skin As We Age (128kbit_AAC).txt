[SPEAKER_00]: Okay here we look at skin as we age and as
this kind of time-lapse shows kind of see
[SPEAKER_00]: the progression of skin as we age and what
changes that occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see we start young and youthful
and slowly as we age our skin becomes that
[SPEAKER_00]: less youthful look that less resilient a
little more wrinkles suddenly develop and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what happens as we adrenaline a
little bit more about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off skin as we age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well stratum basale is the most comprised
of keratinocytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are responsible for renewing the
skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking down here in this deeper
layer here we're not talking right at the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: These keratinocytes produce keratin as you
may guess and this is a protein that
[SPEAKER_00]: protects our skin from chemical products
and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these migrate from the basal layer up
towards the skin surface so this is our
[SPEAKER_00]: skin surface and this is kind of where
they're being generated from and again our
[SPEAKER_00]: orientation here's our dermal layer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they move upwards to the skin surface
they're dividing and changing you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: notice as they actually go.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are younger cells and these are our
older cells and our derma cell turnover by
[SPEAKER_00]: age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you get older we notice that the
cell turnover from an infant is every 14
[SPEAKER_00]: days you're getting cell turnover to as
you get older the amount of days
[SPEAKER_00]: increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So infants and teens you're talking about
two weeks to three weeks to four weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: about and as you get older we're talking
about 45, 84 days much longer over a month
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're basically over the age of 40
and this is how our skin ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's generated down here we notice it's
changing in morphology and also function
[SPEAKER_00]: as it works its way up towards the surface
before it eventually falls off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again giving you that progression as
you age collagen production decreases and
[SPEAKER_00]: this reduces our skin's ability to repair
and it becomes less elastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: See more of a kind of a cartoon image here
try more of a real world simulation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This loss of that kind of elasticity of
our skin causes wrinkles this is because
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction of blood flow through the dermal
capillaries building in fewer nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well less nutrients means less chance of
renewal less chance of rapid growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: division.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the thinning of epidermis and this
is slowing the cell turnover rate and
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing the barrier in function of the
epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the epidermis still provides protection
but as we age it starts to provide less
[SPEAKER_00]: protection because it's getting thinner
that barrier is becoming less.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you again a little visual
representation and also some more
[SPEAKER_00]: information on from your 20s to your 30s
to your 40s to 50 plus what kind of is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening and progressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to draw your attention just to
kind of the shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in your 20s nice youthful flat
look to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30s we're starting to get a little bit of
that movement here a little bit of those
[SPEAKER_00]: wrinkles starting to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40s a little bit worse you see 50s more
pronounced there and we have this
[SPEAKER_00]: transition of reduction of collagen and we
have that significant decrease in moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: retention is slowing getting that more
kind of dry look that more aged look
[SPEAKER_00]: there's increasing wrinkles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not everything necessarily gets better
with age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the aging of the skin to kind
of give you some of these major
[SPEAKER_00]: age-related changes that occur in a long
list here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly none of them really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from injury and infections to
increase immune system starts to decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun protection diminishes because again
it's getting thinner here and getting also
[SPEAKER_00]: drier skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less elasticity to the skin less
resilience to the skin heat loss decreases
[SPEAKER_00]: it's slow to repair and basically just
showing harmful effects of the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental damage over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sadly again all not good things that
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just one of your body's abilities
to provide a barrier and again that
[SPEAKER_00]: decreases as you age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple of fun facts here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shed the skin cells continuously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple of facts here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans shed about a million dead skin
cells every 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you probably you know don't realize the
sheer number of skin cells that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: shedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the average person will shed about
600 pounds 270 about kilograms of skin
[SPEAKER_00]: during their lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ever wonder what you know you're
dusting for and what the dust bunnies are
[SPEAKER_00]: in the corner of the room or down the hall
that's actually skin cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because you're shedding so many of
them so rapidly the more people get in an
[SPEAKER_00]: area the more likely to have those dust
that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I should go through and make
sure going through regulating cleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: areas to remove those skin cells that
they're just a normal body function of the
[SPEAKER_00]: shedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
