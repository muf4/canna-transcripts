[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at light wattages and voltages
is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever been looking at lighting,
you might see things that are offered in
[SPEAKER_00]: different voltages, and maybe you got the
wrong one shipped to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also wattages, you might be wondering what
that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll help explain that a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about wattages in this
case, and volts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking these are the same volts,
these are the same 120 volts, or this one
[SPEAKER_00]: has a grounding plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has nothing to do with the wattages
or the volts, but it is advised that you
[SPEAKER_00]: buy something that does have the grounding
plug attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, watts, this might be what
you're most familiar with if you're out to
[SPEAKER_00]: change light bulbs, because it's the
amount of energy it takes to produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain amount of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are, you know, 60 watt light
bulbs indicated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher the wattage, the more power the
fixture uses, and ideally, the brighter
[SPEAKER_00]: the light it will produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is preferred why it is, so for
full-size vegetative plants and flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, focus on four, 600, or 1,000 watt
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most growers are focusing on the 600 or
the 1,000 watts in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything small in this is not going to
allow for maximum yields, and it's better
[SPEAKER_00]: used for clones or seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,000 watt bulbs, we see here,
this could be the Pro 1000 double-ended
[SPEAKER_00]: watt bulbs, are considered to be the
standard for North America by most
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other parts of the world or other growers
will use 600 as kind of their standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, we're seeing 1,000 watt bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,000 watts being the general standard
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the other terms you might be familiar
with in the sense of electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This diagram shows a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have amps, which is the amount of
charge or current flowing through the
[SPEAKER_00]: circuit over a period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the volts, which is like the
pressure in line causing the current to
[SPEAKER_00]: flow through the wire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the push.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have ohms, which is the unit of
measurement indicating the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance applied to a current.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to keep the ohms as small as
possible, because we don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: restrict this flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of what could cause excessive
heating and potentially lead to fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we might hear a 120 volt system
versus a 240 volt system.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the plugs do look vastly different,
it's more than that, than just what the
[SPEAKER_00]: outer plug is.
[SPEAKER_00]: 120 volts with most appliances run on,
though if you have something that requires
[SPEAKER_00]: a high amount of energy, such as a dryer,
will typically run on 220 or 240 volts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watts is equal to volts times amps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's use an example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at changing the volts and
how it relates to amps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, in this case, a 1200 watt
appliance or required motor or a light or
[SPEAKER_00]: something to that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're keeping that the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in one case, we're going to buy
120 volt supporting light.
[SPEAKER_00]: In another case, we're going to buy a 240
volt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the 120 volts is going to draw 10
amps, while the 240 is only going to draw
[SPEAKER_00]: 5 amps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this mean, other than the
outlets look differently?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 240 volt requires less current or
amps and a smaller conductor can be used,
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller wire can be used, which can be
advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 240 is the world's standards,
while the United States still use the 120
[SPEAKER_00]: volt as its standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep in mind different parts of
the world would not be located.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see why in some cases the 240
volt is advantageous, simply because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the less amps requiring a smaller
conductor that can be used to transfer
[SPEAKER_00]: that energy.
So what does this mean, other than the
outlets look differently?
