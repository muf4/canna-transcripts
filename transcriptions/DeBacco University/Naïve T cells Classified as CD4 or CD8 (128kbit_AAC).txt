[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at naive T
cells classified as either CD4 or CD8.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have seen these images before
depending on what order you watched some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the videos I have posted under this
channel, but we're going to explore these
[SPEAKER_00]: in a little bit more detail in this
lecture series.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking for CD4 and CD8 cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: These molecules are important because they
regulate how the T cell will interact with
[SPEAKER_00]: and respond to an antigen presenting cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's abbreviated APC.
[SPEAKER_00]: APC, antigen presenting cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice in this case in particular where
cell to cell recognition is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two populations of T cells have different
mechanisms for immune protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both bind with MHC molecules via their
antigen receptors called T cell receptors,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically abbreviated TCRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case the TCR, the T cell
receptors are the kind of the purple
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our antigen presenting cell are the green
molecules here and here's our antigens
[SPEAKER_00]: being presented on this cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to lead us down either the
CD4 pathway or the CD8 pathway and we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about each of those coming up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the CD4 pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these CD4 cells bind with APCs,
antigen presenting cells, via their
[SPEAKER_00]: antigen embedding MHC2 molecules and are
stimulated to become helper T cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these cells that go into and stimulate
B cells or cytotoxic C cells directly or
[SPEAKER_00]: secrete cytokines to inform more in
various target cells about the pathogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this kind of block of text
kind of look like in an image?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well here we have our CD4 pathways that
we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our T cell receptors here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our CD4.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this is allowing is an activated
helper T cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when our CD4 helper T cell binds with
MH2 complex, an antigen presenting cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: the antigen presenting cell and T cells
now release our cytokines.
[SPEAKER_00]: In response to the cytokines, T cell
clones itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in response to this we're noticing one
cell basically cloning itself going into
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cloned T cells are produced
different cytokines and activate either B
[SPEAKER_00]: cells and CD8 cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these can go about as being an
integral part of the immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does our CD4 do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well there's binding that's very important
in the immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're then releasing a compound causing
T cells to clone itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there T cells are able to
differentiate into the CD8 pathway and B
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna investigate in this lecture
the CD8 next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna follow this cell along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the CD8, now what that does
is that engages in antigen embedded MHC1
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules on the APCs, antigen presenting
cells that are stimulating to become
[SPEAKER_00]: cytotoxic T cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are responsible for directly killing
infected cells by apoptosis and emitting
[SPEAKER_00]: cytokines to amplify the immune response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our CD8 binding in our cytotoxic
T cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this interacts with the MH1 complex,
the epitope complex, an infected cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: it produces these molecules here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These molecules are very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: These molecules go on now in our infected
cell because this cell basically has now
[SPEAKER_00]: either virus particles in it or is in some
way compromised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its expression's gonna be slightly
different and the peripheral forins form
[SPEAKER_00]: the pores in the membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at breaking up apart this
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: By adding these kind of pores to the cell,
we're able to break the cell down,
[SPEAKER_00]: lysing the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember the cytotoxic T cells are
responsible for destroying this infected
[SPEAKER_00]: cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want this cell to be able to go
on and spread these virus particles
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the entire body.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, the cytotoxic T cell is
responsible for lysing or destroying that
[SPEAKER_00]: cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the CD4 and CD8 cells both are surface
molecules and differentiate whether TCR
[SPEAKER_00]: will engage in MHC2 or MHC1 molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our one and here's our two.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you may suspect, the two molecule has
two here embedded and the MH class one
[SPEAKER_00]: only has one binded here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they assist in binding with
specificity, the CD4 and CD8 molecules are
[SPEAKER_00]: described as co-receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very important in our binding that
occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are an integral molecule part of the
binding and recognition process of the
[SPEAKER_00]: immune system.
Thank you.
Thank you.
