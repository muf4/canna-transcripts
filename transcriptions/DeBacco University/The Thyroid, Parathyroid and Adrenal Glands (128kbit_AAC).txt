[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're gonna look at three important
glands of the endocrine system,
[SPEAKER_00]: the thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenal
glands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see our thyroid and parathyroid
are located very close in proximity to one
[SPEAKER_00]: another in the throat region, and then our
adrenal glands are located on top of our
[SPEAKER_00]: both left and right kidney.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting first with the thyroid gland,
where it lies just below the Adam's apple
[SPEAKER_00]: in front of the neck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it located here and
highlighted right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two most important hormones are
theroxin, which increases the metabolic
[SPEAKER_00]: rate and promotes growth, and it contains
iodine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lack of iodine in the diet can cause
goiters, which we're gonna take a look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So theroxin, if we don't, is looking for
the iodine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains iodine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a lack of iodine, this is gonna
swell up and get quite large and result in
[SPEAKER_00]: a goiter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcitonin is the other hormone that's
important, and that stimulates calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: deposition in bone, puts calcium into
bones, calcitonin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goiter that I mentioned, iron
deficiency causes the thyroid to enlarge,
[SPEAKER_00]: that tries to produce the hormone
theroxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It getting larger can ultimately look like
this, and this is an extreme case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we get iodine in our diet?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times in salt, we'll see what's
called iodized salt, and those small
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts, those trace amounts of iodine
located in there can help prevent a goiter
[SPEAKER_00]: from forming to keep the thyroid gland its
normal size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another hormone is the parathyroid gland,
and this is one that's located,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, in close proximity to the
thyroid gland, and there's four small
[SPEAKER_00]: glands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here, one, two, three, four,
that are attached to the thyroid,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they produce the parathyroid hormone,
typically abbreviated PTH.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of only two hormones essential for
survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next is a fail-safe mechanism ensuring
calcium levels never rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium levels never fall too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulating calcium is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have another video series on that,
and this is kind of that fail-safe
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that hormone preventing it from
getting too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: If calcium gets too low in the body,
that can easily cause death to occur,
[SPEAKER_00]: because calcium ions are key for muscle
contractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's their main part, and remember that
your heart is a form of a muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: When levels are low, PTH stimulates
osteoclast cells to break down the bone
[SPEAKER_00]: matrix, ensuring that 99% of calcium you
have reserved in your bones, ensuring that
[SPEAKER_00]: 1% is always present in your circulatory
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will cause a raise in calcium levels
in the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adrenal glands, you can see them
located here, but the left and the right,
[SPEAKER_00]: are two glands located just above each
kidney.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're composed of two parts,
the vidula, which is the inner core,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you see here, and this is responsible
for adrenaline and norepinephrine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This releases in times of stress,
to simulate rapid deployment of body fuel,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then there's the cortex, which is the
outer shell, as we see here, and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: cortisol.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stimulates carbohydrate metabolism
and reduces inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the testosterone is also important for
stimulating the kidney uptake of sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: and other ions from the urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, kidneys are doing excretion and
also retention of certain ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the other hormone that's
absolutely essential for survival,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the couple essential for survival
hormones, and that's the other one,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I mentioned, number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this is helpful to understand
some of the glands of our very important
[SPEAKER_00]: endocrine system.
