[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBacco University video,
we're going to go over selective plant
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest process of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to get to see an actual
example in a greenhouse setting where the
[SPEAKER_00]: apical bud was taken to allow time for
those side buds to kind of develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get to see an actual example of
this process in action.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into selective plant
harvest process regarding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember at the end, you'll see that
an actual example in a greenhouse setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, when we're looking at
selective harvest, plants do not mature in
[SPEAKER_00]: unison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most plants will have variability in
degree of maturity of their buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ensuring each is at the peak harvest
simply puts required for a staggered
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest because they're not all ripening
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking those apical buds and letting
these develop can be a great way to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of make sure all the buds are being
harvested at their peak maturity,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just saying, oh, one's ready to go and
we take the entire plant because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be that variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're kind of reducing the amount of
variability you have in each bud in the
[SPEAKER_00]: end at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: So harvesting only the tops first.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the methods that we will
see example at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can only harvest the top buds first
and wait for the others, this can
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatically improve your overall end
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is due to the fact that the top bud
or buds simply get more light intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: than lower buds, which speeds up the
maturation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: These apical buds will have greater size
and density, which are two main qualities
[SPEAKER_00]: that are highly sought after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you remove or cut down that top
bud, well, now these side buds that
[SPEAKER_00]: might've gotten a little bit of shading
from that larger top bud, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: now they're going to get more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're going to be able to mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're going to be able to get to a
larger size than they would if you left
[SPEAKER_00]: that top bud on there and just waited
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: By removing that top bud, those secondary
buds have a greater chance at developing
[SPEAKER_00]: and becoming higher quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, once the top is gone,
and here's an example of a picture,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll see this similar one to this in
a moment here, but that top is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that top bud off.
[SPEAKER_00]: After we take that apical bud as removed,
this allows the lower buds, we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: here and also here, to be exposed to more
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This increase in light exposure will help
increase their development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, this will allow these lower buds
to increase in size and density.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would not have been possible if the
top apical bud was left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know there's a little bit of powdery
mildew going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That increased light exposure can also
help with that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here we can see clearly that top
apical bud is removed, and these side buds
[SPEAKER_00]: now are going to have a better chance at
producing a higher quality end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So concentrates or a dry flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're going to make
concentrates, there is simply less
[SPEAKER_00]: incentive to perform selective harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrates, because you're going to be
concentrating it anyway, you can go
[SPEAKER_00]: through it and just kind of do that whole
plant harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you're looking to have top
quality dry flower and as much of this
[SPEAKER_00]: product as possible, then selective
harvest would be recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will add to the final dry weight and
density of the total buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to go through in a
greenhouse setting and we're going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: a look at what this kind of selective
harvest removing of that apical bud
[SPEAKER_00]: actually looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in an effort to kind of get the maximum
yield, here we can see the growers
[SPEAKER_00]: selected to take the top or apical mirror
stem bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take that top bud off, get that cured and
dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have our secondary buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to give them a little bit more
time to kind of cure up and dry and expand
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're able to get the kind of A grade
or top grade off the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows these to kind of finish up
ripening to maximize the harvest we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get.
Thank you for watching and we'll see you
next time.
