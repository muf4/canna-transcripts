[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBacco University video,
we're going to explore manual cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant takedown for harvest, something you
might be familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you some tips and tricks and to
explain it a little bit more in detail
[SPEAKER_00]: here on this video lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the manual
cannabis plant takedown harvest regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, physical labor is required.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the kind of pro and con to this
method is that as the name implies,
[SPEAKER_00]: this requires physically cutting down the
plant by hand and transporting it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next location, typically your drying
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this process can be incorporated
into an operation that's also looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: do selective harvesting as a first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this manual harvest, this manual
takedown, you can also go through to
[SPEAKER_00]: selective harvest first and then take
larger plants a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does afford you that option.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do a slightly staggered harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That manual harvesting for indoor growing
is likely the only option, but it is
[SPEAKER_00]: easier when plants are being grown in
containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing outdoors, well,
then if you're an outdoor grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of like harvesting Christmas
trees from the field, which requires
[SPEAKER_00]: energy and willingness to get a little
dirty as you're kind of going through
[SPEAKER_00]: close to that soil and cutting that plant
down, picking it up and transporting it to
[SPEAKER_00]: its next location there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all part of the kind of fun of the
manual harvesting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a very common procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is nothing kind of really new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically the plant will be cut down at
ground level with heavy duty loppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this allows the entire plant to be
easily handled and limits the need for
[SPEAKER_00]: unnecessary cuts, which can take more time
and also more labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are seeing someone going through here
and probably doing a little bit more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: selective harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe taking some of the larger buds,
putting them into a separate container for
[SPEAKER_00]: a separate drying process there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also helps hold the entire plant
together for easy transport when you cut
[SPEAKER_00]: that entire plant down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, if you're taking a couple off,
that's perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the rest of the plant can be
dried together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great at keeping everything kind of
collected together, easy for transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't kind of have a lot of little
parts kind of missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to have forward thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you know you're going to be manually
harvesting your crop at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: season, this may influence the variety you
select the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically selecting smaller plants would
be preferred to allow you to actually be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to handle them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to go through and do multiple,
maybe cut it in half and cut that in half
[SPEAKER_00]: again to be able to handle the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excessively large plants may have higher
yields, at least on paper, but manually
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting process will be difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to increase chance of plant
damage and this could reduce the total end
[SPEAKER_00]: product or at least the quality of the end
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always good to have an idea of how
you'll be harvesting in the end because
[SPEAKER_00]: that may be a contributing factor to
influencing exactly what you plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: what variety of cultivar you plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you can ensure that when it comes
to harvest, you're not going to have any
[SPEAKER_00]: incidental loss to physical damage simply
because the plants got too high and only
[SPEAKER_00]: because you saw you read it on the paper,
oh, it's going to produce this much per
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure you can handle those
in an efficient manner and you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of physical damage, reducing your
overall yield, cutting down on your total
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
Thank you.
