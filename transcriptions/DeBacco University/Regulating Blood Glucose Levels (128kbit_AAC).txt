[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to investigate how
the body goes about regulating blood
[SPEAKER_00]: glucose levels, how it has ways to both
raise and also lower these glucose levels
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to maintain homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to focus on the organ of
the pancreas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pancreas is located behind the stomach
and it secretes a number of digestive
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes into the small intestine through a
narrow tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we're going to focus on the
islets of Langerhans within the pancreas
[SPEAKER_00]: which govern blood glucose levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insulin is a hormone that promotes the
accumulation of glucagon in liver and
[SPEAKER_00]: triglycerides in fat cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's glucagon which causes the
release of stored glucose and fat
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does this look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we have too much glucose in our
blood after eating, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: a high-sugar carbohydrate-based diet,
insulin will put glucose into cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So insulin puts insulin into cells,
particularly adipose cells take up the
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we exercise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't eat for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will cause a decrease in our blood
sugar levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will then cause the pancreas to
release glucagon which will stimulate the
[SPEAKER_00]: liver to break down the sugar and put it
into glucose and increase our blood sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if then we consume another
sugar-based diet here, that will cause
[SPEAKER_00]: insulin to be produced to put the glucose
back into cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We exercise for a while and we can see how
this goes around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some ways where this doesn't work
properly would be diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's affected individuals cannot take up
glucose in the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type 1 is only about 5 to 10 percent of
diabetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an autoimmune disorder in which the
immune system attacks those islets of
[SPEAKER_00]: Langerhans.
[SPEAKER_00]: This typically develops before the age of
20.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often called juvenile onset diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's treated by daily injections of
insulin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's that normal condition where
producing insulin is being received,
[SPEAKER_00]: glucose is uptake in that cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in type 1, we have an autoimmune
disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're attacking those islets of
Langerhans, insulin is not being produced
[SPEAKER_00]: even though we have a fully functional
receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through those daily injections,
those individuals can help correct that
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, type 2 diabetes, which is the
vast majority, is caused by abnormally low
[SPEAKER_00]: number of insulin receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This develops typically after the age of
40 and as a result is called adult onset
[SPEAKER_00]: diabetes, typically in obese individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is treated usually by diet or
exercise because there's simply a low
[SPEAKER_00]: number of insulin receptors even though
insulin is being produced at a normal
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if there's too much glucose in the
blood, insulin converts some of it to
[SPEAKER_00]: glycogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see our glucose in the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body is going to want to convert some
of that to the glycogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our insulin being produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to take some of that and
put it into glycogen, which will be
[SPEAKER_00]: stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to see that again, here's our
glucose in the blood, very high levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insulin's being released, taking some of
that up and storing it as glycogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now again, the opposites occur that
there's not enough glucose in the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glycogen converts some of that into
glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our glycogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what our glucagon actually looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take this, break them down,
and it's going to put them into the
glycogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, insulin is taking blood out of
the blood vessel, putting it into storage,
[SPEAKER_00]: and glucagon is taking that and breaking
it apart so that there is some glucose in
[SPEAKER_00]: the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how the blood glucose level changes
over time, we're looking at specifically a
[SPEAKER_00]: day here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see during our meals, we have this
insulin levels increasing, increasing to
[SPEAKER_00]: help reduce and keep our blood glucose in
a very tight range as of today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body tries to maintain homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially, while this may look like
very large spikes, this is occurring in a
[SPEAKER_00]: very tight range, helping the body
maintain homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here again, here's our blood,
here's our pancreas, here's our liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having an increase in blood sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glucagon's being released because we have
that low blood sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to increase our blood sugar
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glucagon's responsible for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's causing the breakdown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then our insulin is put in our glucose
into storage, so into those cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a result of high blood sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insulin will want to decrease our blood
sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's putting it into storage, and the loop
goes around and around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, after you have a high sugar
diet, particularly a lot of candy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may have a lot of energy and feel very
energetic because you have high blood
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insulin will be produced, and this
typically can be related to the sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: crash.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason being insulin may overshoot and
may overproduce too much, causing a
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease in your blood sugar, causing you
to lose your energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glucagon will then take a little while to
get started to help release some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: blood sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of going back and forth to
help your body maintain homeostasis.
