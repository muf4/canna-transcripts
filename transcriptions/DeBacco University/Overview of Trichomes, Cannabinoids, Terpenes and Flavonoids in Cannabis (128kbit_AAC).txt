[SPEAKER_00]: Now providing with an overview of
trichomes, cannabinoids, terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: flavonoids, and cannabis is kind of a
large undertaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, I'm just going to touch on
some of the key aspects of these and
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that they're much more complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will just give you that general
understanding of what these different
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with trichomes, these are
small crystal-like structures that are
[SPEAKER_00]: produced that produce the cannabinoids and
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be said to have an almost
translucent mushroom-like appearance,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we kind of see here and here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These resin glands are often sticky to the
touch, and quality trichomes equal a
[SPEAKER_00]: quality product in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are extremely sticky of a sunny dew.
[SPEAKER_00]: These trichomes are capturing an insect
here, but you may be more familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes on like a hairiness kind of to
like a tomato plant that they occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically for cannabis, we're looking at
trichome production under a microscope or
[SPEAKER_00]: a loop to kind of make magnify them
because quality trichomes typically
[SPEAKER_00]: directly correlate to a quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabinoids, THC, I have the
pronunciation here, stands for
[SPEAKER_00]: tetrahydrocannabinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the compound that produces the
euphoric high, typically associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like on a chemical
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD or cannabidiol does not have these
intoxicating effects of THC, but has more
[SPEAKER_00]: potential use in the pharmaceutical
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what can be classified as hemp,
as long as the cannabis plant has less
[SPEAKER_00]: than 0.3% THC from federal regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes are volatile or aromatic oils
that impact flavor, aroma, and effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see them dripping here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis does have about 140 different
terpenes identified, but terpenes are not
[SPEAKER_00]: only found in cannabis, as we see in this
conifer resin, these kind of pine trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're secreted by the same glands that
produce the cannabinoids, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, and the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the terpenes themselves,
it can also be an indirect impact on how
[SPEAKER_00]: the body processes other cannabinoids,
such as THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they themselves have some effects,
but they can also influence effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: other compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavonoids, many exist naturally in
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They primarily produce coloration or
pigments to the plant to help attract
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinators and offer protection from
damaging UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anthocyanins are probably the most widely
recognized for their purple color,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as in purple kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could also have the purpliness and
blueness of blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poison ivy, when it first comes out,
will have these flavonoids, or
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically these anthocyanins,
to help shield it from damaging UV or
[SPEAKER_00]: intense sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it gets older, it will lose those
pigments and have more of that
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not well documented, but it shows the
possible interactions with cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they may also, too, have some
interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that gives you just that general
overview of these very complex products
[SPEAKER_00]: that cannabis can produce, so you can
understand at least a little bit of the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between them.
