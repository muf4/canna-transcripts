[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here we're looking at odor control
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I want to keep in mind that this is
not odor control of the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to focus on odor control
during the actual grow phases through the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Odor control is more important later in
the stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early on, cannabis, while it does have a
distinct odor, will not necessarily be as
[SPEAKER_00]: pungent early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as it progresses in ages typically
around week six or so, the odor will
[SPEAKER_00]: become more prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is an odor control.
[SPEAKER_00]: While air circulation is needed,
it is not advised to be directly exhausted
[SPEAKER_00]: air from your grow facility due to
distinctive odor that can be produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no harm in this, but the reason
why you may want to consider this odor
[SPEAKER_00]: control is if you're in an area,
it could increase odds of complaints that
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone enjoys the smell of growing
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding a charcoal filter will drastically
reduce the cannabis odor while you're
[SPEAKER_00]: exhausting air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to just have a fan and
just send air directly out, especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in an area where you could have
complaints that could arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an ozone generator.
[SPEAKER_00]: This converts oxygen to ozone,
which is O3, by exposing it to UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can help reduce odors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changes the charges of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It binds and neutralizes with those odor
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this reduction does take some time for
this ozone to come in contact with these
[SPEAKER_00]: smelly cannabis particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be prohibited in areas that have
high areas of volume exchanges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, UV light is dangerous, and so is
ozone for both you and the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So caution is advised if you're
implementing this type of system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the O3 molecules are unstable,
only last for about half an hour or so,
[SPEAKER_00]: about 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are using ozone and it does
somehow come in contact with the plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: high doses, that can damage the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if it comes in contact with the grower,
that can be another caution because it can
[SPEAKER_00]: damage humans' lung tissue as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be cautious if you are looking at
implementing an ozone generator type
[SPEAKER_00]: system for odor control.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is more advised is carbon filter for
odor reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be installed for operations
through the entire grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I said, it's most important from
that week six or on or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when odors tend to become more of
an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to size your system accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't mess with when it's too small.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can favor going slightly larger if you
need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But be sure that you have an idea of what
size would be recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not enriching with CO2,
then you can easily increase the power of
[SPEAKER_00]: the exhaust fan to compensate for
potential for reduced airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're running something through a
filter, there will be reduced airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not injecting with CO2,
you can afford to kind of increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: rate of exhaustion of air and ventilation
without worrying about exhausting out your
[SPEAKER_00]: precious carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this activated charcoal filter we see
pictured here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surface air is increased with oxygen to
open pores to increase the absorption and
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbingness of the odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They typically can be covered here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the carbon is on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has an extra filter here to ensure
clean air is being evacuated out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mounted very high, so I'm exhausting
the hottest air as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% virgin activated carbon is what's
recommended due to its very high surface
[SPEAKER_00]: area and potential for the longest life
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: To maximize the effectiveness of a
activated charcoal filter, you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the humidity below 55%.
[SPEAKER_00]: 65 to 70 will reduce performance,
and 80% plus stops performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this means is simply if you're
running this in an area with very high
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, such as for a cloning area,
again, they don't have the pungent odor to
[SPEAKER_00]: begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are looking at running that in
an area with high humidity, those high
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, those moisture will kind of clog
up and eliminate some of the surface area
[SPEAKER_00]: there for that carbon to actively remove
the odors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have the air move slowly
through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be oversizing this fan
and pulling it right through and right out
[SPEAKER_00]: because there needs to be some contact
time between the odor and the activated
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a pre-filter, and that's what
you see here, to remove particulate and
[SPEAKER_00]: change on a regular basis about every 60
days, depending on the quality of air that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is a pre-filter,
easily removed, and it'll help protect and
[SPEAKER_00]: extend the life of your activated carbon
on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, this is for odor
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing a cannabis plant to help
reduce potential for complaints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Size is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inline fan that you're using, exhausting,
dosing or not dosing, enriching with CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these factors come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just another thing to consider
if you're looking at trying to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of having complaints if you're
growing cannabis here with neighbors or
[SPEAKER_00]: people nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
Thanks for watching.
