[SPEAKER_00]: This DeBaco University video is going to
go over how to set up a mechanical timer
[SPEAKER_00]: for your lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's important to plug your lights
into the wall initially to test them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then you want to go through once you
know they're working, as we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: see here in our student series with Keira,
she's going to go over how to properly set
[SPEAKER_00]: up a mechanical timer so you can ensure
your plants will be exposed to the right
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that we know that the lights work,
we don't want them just plugged into the
[SPEAKER_01]: wall anymore because we need them to be
able to turn on and off by themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we invest in a timer for our
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This adjusts the light based on the time
that you set for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you wanted to, it could be for 12
hours, 18 hours, six hours, adjustable for
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever your grow is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first step of setting up a timer is
to align it to the time that it is right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to set it to 420 PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right about there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next, you're going to want to decide how
long you want your lights on for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on how many of these you push
down is how long the timer is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: on for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want it to be on for 18 hours of
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're going from 420,
[SPEAKER_01]: right around 1120, that's where I'd want
it to end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have our one, two,
three, four, five, six hours of nighttime.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see here, the switch can tell
where the time of day is based on the
[SPEAKER_01]: timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would go around and see that it's
nighttime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, nighttime for the plants lights off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then turn back on and click once it
gets back to the turned on section of the
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, once it goes to the end,
it clicks off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then to make sure that all of your effort
was accounted for, you're going to want to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that it's set for timer and not
just indefinite.
So I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.
So I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.
