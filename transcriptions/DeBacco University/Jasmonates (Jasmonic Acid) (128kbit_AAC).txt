[SPEAKER_00]: Here, I'm going to look at the plant
hormone jasmonic acid, also known as
[SPEAKER_00]: jasminates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this can be abbreviated GA,
and since the 1980s details have become
[SPEAKER_00]: better understood, this is one of those
plant hormones that's kind of gone through
[SPEAKER_00]: some recent research and some recent
findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a lipid-derived stress hormone,
so I have the picture of the fats here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's important because it's found in
the membrane in the phospholipid bilayer
[SPEAKER_00]: of the chloroplast, and keep in mind that
is the light-receiving organelle here that
[SPEAKER_00]: is responsible for the photosynthetic
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jasminates regulate plant adaptations to
biotic stresses, and they can be activated
[SPEAKER_00]: during herbivore attack or pathogen
infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of something that
can be upregulated in times of stress to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also involved with abiotic stresses,
such as those that occur in wounding,
[SPEAKER_00]: ozone damage, and ultraviolet radiation,
so it can be involved also with biotic
[SPEAKER_00]: herbivores or pathogens, or also abiotics,
such as wounding examples there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's an increase in the number of
studies have shown that these GAs also
[SPEAKER_00]: function in plant development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that plant development can include
those primary root growth, so very
[SPEAKER_00]: important for root development,
reproductive development, and also leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: senescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, senescence is kind of the
natural aging of the plant that causes
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually to degrade and fall off the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a brief overview of jasminates
or jasminic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
