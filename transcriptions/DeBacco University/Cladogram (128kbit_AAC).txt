[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to be creating a
colladogram in class, so hopefully this
[SPEAKER_00]: will be helpful for you to indicate what
it should generally look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've created here, looking at what an
example of one is, and what an example of
[SPEAKER_00]: one is here, and both ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the middle it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically you have all these little
sections here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't a complete area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here is a complete kind of grouping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same as this, a complete grouping.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one contains a split here,
a divergent evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it only contains part of that,
so that's why it's not considered a full
[SPEAKER_00]: classification set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how things may look.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to build a family tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Textami also enables us to glimpse the
evolutionary history of life on Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phylogeny is the evolutionary history of
an organism and its relationship to other
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reconstruction and study of these
phylogenetic trees is also called
[SPEAKER_00]: systematics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be looking only at one
particular species and how we look at
[SPEAKER_00]: separate species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be interpreting that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll use some examples here of the
divergent evolution and how certain
[SPEAKER_00]: environments and predators made impacted
changes that occur over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a common ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an important term.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's any organism that two or more
descendants have in common.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to tell you what the common
ancestor is, and through your cutouts
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have to determine what is
more closely related to that common
[SPEAKER_00]: ancestor, and what is more distantly
related to that ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the example here of the wolf and all
the dog species that have derived from
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all of the dogs have this one
single common ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some might be related closer to this than
others, but they all in some way,
[SPEAKER_00]: distantly or closely, relate to the common
ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how to build this family tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: This clade here is a group of organisms
related by descent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cladistics is the construction of
phylogeny based on similarities derived
[SPEAKER_00]: from a common ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examination of these characteristics
allows the construction and branching of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cladogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what we'll be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these two examples at the bottom
here don't really fit the category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a single lineage or it can be
the complete common ancestor with the
[SPEAKER_00]: branch here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you could see here within this box
there is no necessary common ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The common ancestor exists outside the
box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same here, this does not include all the
individuals that fall under this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular common ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the reason why these don't
classify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here we would see the same one that's
on the title slide, and again the two end
[SPEAKER_00]: ones are all inclusive and the one in the
middle is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get to the terms called in-groups
and out-groups, and these cladograms are
[SPEAKER_00]: not true family trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to make that separation
or that distinction between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: They convey comparative relationships and
relationship information, and each
[SPEAKER_00]: cladogram contains an out-group to which
the in-group is compared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will be our in-group.
[SPEAKER_00]: These will all be closely related,
and here's our out-group separated out and
[SPEAKER_00]: used to compare to this in-group.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have some similar properties
because they all share the same common
[SPEAKER_00]: ancestor, but these are grouped as the
in-group.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are probably more closely related
than section A here, considered the
[SPEAKER_00]: out-group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Modern method attempts to assign extra
weight to the evolutionary significance of
[SPEAKER_00]: key characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call this weighting characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of just kind of organizing,
we kind of give weight to certain
[SPEAKER_00]: developments that may be more complex that
occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phylogenies are constructed based on large
amounts of information about an organism
[SPEAKER_00]: gathered over years.
[SPEAKER_00]: To construct these trees, traditional
taxonomists used both ancestral and
[SPEAKER_00]: derived characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cladists only used the derived
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that traditional versus the
classification versus the cladogram,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see here we're giving a little bit more
weight to certain ways to divide certain
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see two different ways of
basically separating out things,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the cladogram here is using a little
bit more specifics to divide that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which approach is better?
[SPEAKER_00]: The traditional is when there's a lot of
information available to guide character
[SPEAKER_00]: weighting, and the cladistics is used when
little information about how a character
[SPEAKER_00]: affects the life of the organism is used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in class, you're just going to get
pictures, so therefore we can't really
[SPEAKER_00]: perform the traditional taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have enough information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know exactly the years or the
duration of the species' diversities,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's how we're going to develop this
cladistics is what we're going to use,
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly based on phenotypic features.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two ways to classify a terrestrial
vertebrates here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice here, birds have their own class,
and over here, birds are lumped with
[SPEAKER_00]: reptiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the traditional alphiology and
taxonomic classification, if you remember,
[SPEAKER_00]: flipping back, that's when a lot of
information is used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot of information where we
separate out birds into their own separate
[SPEAKER_00]: category.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we're just kind of looking at
comparative features.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get kind of lumped into more with
reptiles than separate out into their own
[SPEAKER_00]: specific class here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just important to keep in mind
the limitations of how we organize things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simply based on the information we're
able to collect and use.
