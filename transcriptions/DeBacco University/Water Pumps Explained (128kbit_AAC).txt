[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to briefly cover some
of the water pumps and explain a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Submersible, inline, and some pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we're going to avoid the hand pump
here, so if you're using one of these,
[SPEAKER_00]: odds are probably not able to take
advantage of some of the common irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these here run on some form of
power, rather than just manual power here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we've got to start with some
terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two key ones that you may see pumps
displayed in, many different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: pumps out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The standard classifications are,
they will tell you how many gallons per
[SPEAKER_00]: minute, GPM, or gallons per hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll give you that quote so you have an
idea of the flow rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you might see something called head
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the maximum pumping height,
or called the zero flow point.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is how high, or how many
feet can that pump that water before it's
[SPEAKER_00]: unable to actually cause a flow rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be the head height there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be important if you're mounting
a pump very low and you're putting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of a big irrigation tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to pump it out of the tank and
up to another area if you're going uphill
[SPEAKER_00]: for a larger operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind of what head
height is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, an inline pump, typically placed
outside the water reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more powerful than these
submersible pumps I'll talk about in a
[SPEAKER_00]: second.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do tend to require air cooling,
and they're commonly found in large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to oversize these pumps due to
restrictions in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've used these.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be quite powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be a little noisy at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are air cooled, and sometimes they do
need priming, so keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're a little bit better for larger
operations or moving a little higher
[SPEAKER_00]: volume of water in most cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's submersible pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: These sit directly in the water reserves
that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage is these pumps are water
cooled.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're keeping that water at a good
temperature, it can help cool the pumps so
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't burn it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are running it for an extended
period of time though, recirculating that
[SPEAKER_00]: water in particular, you can heat the
water up with this type of pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that also in mind of the pros and
cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage is when it is pumping,
it is mixing the nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically used in smaller operations due
to the overall lack of power found in this
[SPEAKER_00]: classification of pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite stated values, you want to figure
out what you need, and then purchase a
[SPEAKER_00]: pump that's about double the volume that
you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply because of the lack of efficiencies
tends to be with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their stated values tend to be a little
bit overstating, and I feel those values.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to watch the head height,
so you don't want to have these pump a
[SPEAKER_00]: great distance up, because they can be a
little bit weaker most of the time in that
[SPEAKER_00]: regards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just keep note of it, or look for that
on the pump you're looking at purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use this one here in a flood and drain
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one, the sub-pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are commonly used to transfer and
mix in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also pump out a basement that tends to
flood, so that's where you may be familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be classified as kind of this
special classification of submersible
[SPEAKER_00]: pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to come a little bit larger
sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be measured in horsepower,
but commonly used for transfer or mix in.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit on the larger end of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have this kind of automatic shut
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just kind of a specialized
version.
[SPEAKER_00]: This we talked about previously are
submersible pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to be submerged in that water to
help pump it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you're looking at a bigger
operation, this could be something to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that gives you just that brief
overview of pumps to consider for your
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
