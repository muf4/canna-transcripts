[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in a small grow space
and want a very simple way of adding
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide to your area, looking at
point injection behind a fan is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: way to easily add carbon dioxide to your
grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here in Tobacco University,
I'll describe some of the details with
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the video looking at point
injection behind a fan for carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this point injection behind a fan,
pretty simple method in the sense that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very simple to assemble and also very
cost effective, mainly because most likely
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a fan your grow area anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adding the point injection behind the
fan just will help increase the efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: of its distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: In larger rooms, there should be multiple
points of injection, but this can help
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure that there is a more even
distribution with equipment that's likely
[SPEAKER_00]: already in place in your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now an oscillating fan would be of course
the best option because while any fan will
[SPEAKER_00]: help disperse carbon dioxide, using an
oscillating fan will help disperse the gas
[SPEAKER_00]: evenly, even more efficiently across the
grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind, carbon dioxide will want
to sink in the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're injecting at a higher point
and mixing it around this way,
[SPEAKER_00]: as it naturally wants to fall down through
the grow space, it'll actually fall
[SPEAKER_00]: through the plants and be naturally
dispersed through them allowing for a very
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the direction of the fan so fans
should be dispersing air across the tops
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that CO2 can fall through the
plants because it's heavier than air.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, be mindful of the placement of
the exhaust system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be injecting your CO2,
maybe higher up the canopy, but you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to have it right next to your exhaust
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have that a separate area so
that the CO2 will naturally want to fall
[SPEAKER_00]: down and your exhaust will pull out the
hotter air and limit the amount of CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: that's wasted by going out your exhaust
system for cooling the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the placement of the sensor with this
system, as we can see here, another fan
[SPEAKER_00]: being utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when deciding where to place the
sensor, it should be about one half to two
[SPEAKER_00]: thirds of the travel distance of the air
moved by the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help provide an overall carbon
dioxide concentration in the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it too close or too far
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of trying to get that average reading
that the plants are experiencing so that
[SPEAKER_00]: as your controller is monitoring those
levels and trying to maintain certain
[SPEAKER_00]: levels, it's the average level the plants
will be exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: To help allow for a very efficient growing
operation with carbon dioxide enrichment,
[SPEAKER_00]: but always make sure no other factors are
limiting to get the best benefit from
[SPEAKER_00]: enriching your grow space with carbon
dioxide.
