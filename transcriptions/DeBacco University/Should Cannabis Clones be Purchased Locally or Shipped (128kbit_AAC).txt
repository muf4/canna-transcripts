[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tobacco University video,
we'll go over should cannabis clones be
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased locally or shipped in cases
where growers cannot produce their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's give you some of the
advantages and disadvantages of purchasing
[SPEAKER_00]: clones locally or having them shipped in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, it's important to understand
that the end product should be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be some variability,
but purchasing clones can save you the
[SPEAKER_00]: need to create a propagation environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're limited on space or time,
purchasing starting clones can be
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, whether they're purchased locally
or shipped in, the end product should be
[SPEAKER_00]: the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some advantages and
disadvantages to each method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, if we're looking at
purchasing local clones, what are some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the advantages to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, typically you can see the end
product before you shell out the money to
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have some strains that are good
fit for your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the sense that they're produced there
for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also get the clones right when you
need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be able to call up the person
and go pick it up that morning when you
[SPEAKER_00]: can plant that afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can be another advantage of
purchasing your clones locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's also some disadvantages
in the sense that a lot of times local
[SPEAKER_00]: producers mainly have a limited selection
of plant strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be able to get the one Jugu
last year, one that you know works well
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can be, again, a disadvantage of
local clones or local producers of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shipping of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so what's the advantage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would someone go through and bring in
and ship in clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, typically the reason why people go
in that route is they have a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: selection of strain options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because they can be shipped in from
anywhere, they can compare different
[SPEAKER_00]: producers and get exactly what they want
or get some unique different strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: do some comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why some growers do select to
ship in their clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also have the disadvantages of
purchasing clones elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since that may only get to select a
shipping window of time and not an exact
[SPEAKER_00]: date.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because the weather is nice and
perfect, they might be coming on that
[SPEAKER_00]: standard date.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be able to change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones also may be smaller in size than
you would purchase locally due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions on shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep things in the small shipping
boxes as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may cause you to get some smaller
clones if you're getting them shipped in
[SPEAKER_00]: versus purchased locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also there's the damage may occur
during the transportation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how diligent the growers may be
to protect the clones that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: shipping you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's some disadvantages of the
shipping in process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, and results should be the same,
but there's some advantages and
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantages of purchasing your clones
locally or shipping your clones in if you
[SPEAKER_00]: choose not to produce them yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you next time.
