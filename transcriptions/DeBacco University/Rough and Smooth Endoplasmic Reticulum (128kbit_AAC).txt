[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to learn about the
rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically referred to as the rough and the
smooth ER.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see a comparison between
the two animals here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a very rough textured skin,
a very smooth texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that rough, what makes it rough,
what makes it smooth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it is based on the texture,
but really what gives the rough ER that
[SPEAKER_00]: rough kind of texture is the ribosomes
that it is kind of like studded on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like attached to the outside,
giving it that rough appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smooth has very few ribosomes,
giving it that much smoother, more
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within that endoplasmic reticulum,
it's a system of membranes and channels of
[SPEAKER_00]: saccules, which are just these flattened
kind of vesicles, are continuous with the
[SPEAKER_00]: outer membrane of the nuclear envelope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of going from the nucleus,
and we're just leaving the nucleus,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do we hit?
[SPEAKER_00]: The endoplasmic reticulum.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, this rough ER is studded
with ribosomes on the cytoplasmic side,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this allows for protein production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the synthesizing or the
creation or making of those proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also allows for proteins to be modified
and processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugars can be added, resulting in
glycoproteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this rough ER with these ribosomes is
especially abundant in cells that secrete
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of proteins, which makes sense
because it's the site of protein
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a polypeptide, it's synthesized in a
ribosome attached to the rough ER.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's threaded into the cisterial space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you'll notice in this picture is
kind of this high degree of surface here,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of these folds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows for a lot of these ribosomes
to be packed in in a very small area.
[SPEAKER_00]: These folds kind of create its shape,
and this is a very efficient shape as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned these glycoproteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a protein with a glyco group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So proteins with a carbohydrate,
you can think of like a protein with
[SPEAKER_00]: glucose attached, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an example of a carbohydrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: These proteins are packaged into
transport, these kind of vesicles,
[SPEAKER_00]: these curing mediums that can go to the
next stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while information is coming out of the
nucleus going into the ER, not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: finished when it leaves here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may have one more step to finalize
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this rough ER is a membrane factory as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: These membrane-bound proteins are
synthesized directly into the membrane
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like this system working
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: These enzymes in the rough ER also
synthesized phospholipids from precursors
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cytosol of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the smooth ER, you can see kind of
this picture right here, a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: contrast, if you will, very smooth in
appearance, but still has a lot of folds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's basically no ribosomes,
synthesis of lipids occurs, and it forms
[SPEAKER_00]: transport vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the site of various synthetic
processes, it can also detoxify and store
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the smooth ER does have vital
functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, storing metabolizing
carbohydrates for the smooth ER could
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesize and transport lipids,
which are fats, and detoxify poisons in
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs such as alcohol and the liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So liver, a very important filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it contains a lot of this kind of
smooth ER.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can break down stored glucose,
and it can help store calcium ions in
[SPEAKER_00]: muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this ER, this smooth ER is a factor
found in a lot of cells and performs a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of vital functions for our cell.
