[SPEAKER_00]: Interested in learning more about
ectinovate?
[SPEAKER_00]: This Debaco University video is for you to
see how it may apply to your given growing
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's go over using ectinovate
for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, you should define what
ectinovate is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ectinovate is a biological fungicide
with this streptomyces active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a naturally occurring soil
bacterium that was originally isolated
[SPEAKER_00]: from the roots of linseed plants in
England and patented worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been shown effectiveness in both
indoors and outdoors in a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at some studies
specifically looking at this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the study here, you can look at it in
more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the evaluation of disease
management approaches for powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: and cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at ectinovate as well as a couple
other things if you want to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: study in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the specifics of this study?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, powdery mildew on cannabis is caused
by a particular fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fungus that might be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that there are different
versions of powdery mildew, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: common name, they're all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew of squash is different than
powdery mildew that affects, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: like your bee bombs or your, for example,
powdery mildew that affects your lilacs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different variants within the
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to investigate disease management
options, biological, chemical,
[SPEAKER_00]: and physical approaches were assessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A powdery mildew susceptible strain was
grown indoors with continuous exposure to
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew inoculum to really test the
effectiveness of this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the data looking at the control,
which is basically an unsprayed control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Xerotol is basically like a hydrogen
peroxide, natural fungicide, bactericide,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then ectinovate to see how it
compares.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, we can see the trends are that
while the control had the highest levels
[SPEAKER_00]: as would be expected, Xerotol had the
lowest levels and ectinovate fell
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes not statistically different,
sometimes statistically different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what has other research shown regarding
this product?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's different forms of ectinovate
AG is considered to be the agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, previous research has shown that
ectinovate AG to be effective at reducing
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew disease severity compared
to unsprayed controls, but it was
[SPEAKER_00]: ineffective compared to water control on
grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And compared to both water control and
unsprayed treatments, it was ineffective
[SPEAKER_00]: at lowering disease incidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we have to take this into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: On squash and cantaloupe, ectinovate alone
was not found to reduce powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: severity compared to the water control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the efficacy of ectinovate is most
likely due to the antibiotic and kinase
[SPEAKER_00]: production by the streptomyces as well as
induction of plant defenses following the
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in this study, ectinovate did not
provide significant disease reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not currently registered as disease
control on cannabis in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore,
[SPEAKER_00]: its likelihood of being used or its
suggestion to be used is definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced based on the data, as well as the
current registration restrictions in given
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's important to do this study
to determine if the products you're adding
[SPEAKER_00]: are actually effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: The products that are actually worthwhile
are actually able to significantly reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: disease to prove that they're worth the
investment in time to go through and apply
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look more at specifics of the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did look at some other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have the materials and methods
listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just one part of the research
to become an educated grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
