[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'll talk about hardening off plants,
which is basically toughening up the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: structure to be able to handle a harsher
condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, this is when we go from the
protective environment of a clone room to
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe an outside environment or a
greenhouse environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hardening off, this process provides
plants with increased exposure to
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be light to allow for easier
transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be intense light, like I said,
outside light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be drier conditions, outside
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stresses that plants can
go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, when they're very small,
we may baby them, and we need to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: go through a hardening off process so we
don't damage them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Necessary for indoor ceilings that are
grown for an outdoor operation,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they'll be getting intense sunlight
and typically low humidity levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might go from an ice greenhouse to
be protected to the outside environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also go from maybe a cloning room,
which is really high humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: to a greenhouse that might have lower
humidity and increase amounts of light
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light change, so even in indoor
facilities, going from fluorescent lights
[SPEAKER_00]: to high-pressure, high-discharge lights,
such as this high-pressure sodium light,
[SPEAKER_00]: may require a transition process to avoid
burning of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This produces bright lights in both cases,
but this is a much more plant-friendly
[SPEAKER_00]: light than the high-pressure sodiums here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this could also require a transition
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the main goal is to toughen
plants' leaves to reduce the chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf burn or try to prevent this from
occurring or this from occurring when
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are going from different light
levels, intensities, or humidities,
[SPEAKER_00]: or moisture levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a grower error,
I would call it, in the sense that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: know your plant's going to be
transitioning or be changing lights or
[SPEAKER_00]: doing something, you've got to provide the
plant's time to kind of work their way to
[SPEAKER_00]: toughen the outer skin there so you don't
get this burn issue that can easily occur
[SPEAKER_00]: through the process of not allowing the
plant to transfer to a new environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
