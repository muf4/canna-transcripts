[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to go into some of
the basics of the Pyrrhic table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just looking at this kind of example
Pyrrhic table in front of us, we see a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of numbers and a lot of colors,
and every number and color has a reason
[SPEAKER_00]: behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look first for a key, in this case the key
would be right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see where the atomic mass is
provided to us, the chemical symbol,
[SPEAKER_00]: the name, the electron configuration,
the atomic number, oxy-adjacent states,
[SPEAKER_00]: so on and so forth for each of the
elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also see further color coding here,
it gets into some of the families where
[SPEAKER_00]: the noble gases are located here,
the metalloids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, everything here is well
organized and for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Pyrrhic table, let's break this word
down just initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pyrrhic means occurring in intervals,
and a table is simply a set of data
[SPEAKER_00]: systematically displayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why spend time on the Pyrrhic table?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, properties of the elements repeat in
a periodic way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very important tool for
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also allows us to determine or infer
information about elements that we may not
[SPEAKER_00]: know a whole lot about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know, for example, in one particular
family how one behaves, we've got to infer
[SPEAKER_00]: how others within that same family behave
because of these intervals that occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Pyrrhic table basics, elements are
arranged by atomic number, and a typical
[SPEAKER_00]: box contains here the atomic number,
which, remember, is the number of protons,
[SPEAKER_00]: the atomic symbol, C, A, remember,
it's capital C, lowercase a, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: important, that stands for calcium,
which is the element's name, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: atomic mass, which is technically the
average atomic mass, which is the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: why this is carried out to a decimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see also here our magnesium,
Mg is magnesium, we have the atomic
[SPEAKER_00]: number, which is the number of protons,
which is 12, the atomic mass, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: protons plus neutrons, so in this case we
know we have 12 protons, therefore there
[SPEAKER_00]: must be 12 neutrons, and our oxidation
state, which this plus two means that we
[SPEAKER_00]: know there's 12 protons, protons have a
positive charge, electrons have a negative
[SPEAKER_00]: charge, therefore there has to be 10
electrons because you have this plus two
[SPEAKER_00]: charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 positive charges, 10 negative charges
will lead us with a positive two as a
[SPEAKER_00]: result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now continuing on, in our Pyrrhic table,
the periods are horizontal rows,
[SPEAKER_00]: so row one, row two, row three,
row four, this also could be referred to
[SPEAKER_00]: as period one, period two, period three,
and period four, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to remember, period one or
row one contains hydrogen and helium,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we see here and here, so when students
go through and they want to count either
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon or nitrogen or oxygen, they'll
mistakenly say that to row one,
[SPEAKER_00]: remember, this is all row two,
row one only contains hydrogen and helium,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is all, these elements are part of
row two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now groups are vertical columns,
also potentially referred to as families,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll see here these vertical and
these, they're colored so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a group, which is a vertical
column, which is also referred to as a
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see them color coded easily here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's some interactive Pyrrhic
tables that provide you with a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: links that you're welcome to check out,
a lot of great websites to help explain
[SPEAKER_00]: and light up research, certain elements
that provide you with a couple links here
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, in the description is where you
can find links to all the slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: The classification of the elements,
there's three basic classifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's metals, which is the vast majority
of the Pyrrhic table here, non-metals,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is located in this region,
and then metalloids, which kind of have
[SPEAKER_00]: properties sharing kind of both metals and
non-metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your metalloids are located here,
and they separate the non-metals from the
[SPEAKER_00]: metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now metals in general occupy the left side
of the Pyrrhic table.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have luster, are shiny, basically
solids at room temperature except Hg,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the abbreviation for mercury,
ductile, which means the ability to be
[SPEAKER_00]: drawn into wires, which we see here,
this is with copper, and malleable,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the ability to be hammered into
sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're excellent conductors of heat and
electricity, and they tend to form
[SPEAKER_00]: positive ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, if you're an element that's
classified as a metal, odds are you share
[SPEAKER_00]: many of these properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, if you're a non-metal,
again, located kind of in the region over
[SPEAKER_00]: here on the Pyrrhic table, they occupy the
right side.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're generally gases or brittle solids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a dull-looking kind of
appearance, and they are poor conductors
[SPEAKER_00]: of heat and electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bromide is the only liquid at room
temperature, and they tend to form
[SPEAKER_00]: negative ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while most of them are located in this
region here, I don't want you to forget
[SPEAKER_00]: about this one that's located way over on
the far side over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also classified as a non-metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our metalloids are located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be the yellow elements in this
particular Pyrrhic table as presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to go back for a second,
the metalloids kind of share properties
[SPEAKER_00]: that border both metals and non-metals
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to spend a lot of time,
at least in this lecture, on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the families of elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elements of the same family or group share
structural and chemical behavior
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the families I'm going to go
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see that they're organized into
these nice columns.
[SPEAKER_00]: This large block here is a transition
element, and they're considered the same
[SPEAKER_00]: general family here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the first one,
alkali metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're soft, highly reactive,
metals usually stirred under oil or
[SPEAKER_00]: kerosene to prevent their interaction with
air and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They react vigorously with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can produce this potassium,
really producing fire when just added to
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They oxidize readily in the air,
and they're good conductors of
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to remember that group one
is alkali metals, and often it confuses
[SPEAKER_00]: the second group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have group one, alkali metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: These alkali metals have one balanced
electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a zoom in of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will lose an electron very easily,
and when an electron is lost, the metal
[SPEAKER_00]: gains a stable non-reactive noble gas
electron configuration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, they tend to lose an electron,
so lithium tends to have a plus one
[SPEAKER_00]: charge, as does rubidium, as does
francium, as does potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these are group one alkali metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now group two, alkaline earth metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy way to remember that these are group
two is there's two words, alkaline earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just alkali metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: These, your magnesiums, strontiums,
your calciums are harder, denser,
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger, and at higher melting points
than those group one alkali metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are reactive, but not quite as
reactive as group one, and they tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: lose two electrons to gain a more stable
electron configuration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Group three through 12 are the transition
metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not as reactive as group one and
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge variety, but all are shiny in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They form multiple ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also include inner transition
elements and rare earth elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these are generally classified
as our transition metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on along the periodic table,
group 17 down here, most reactive
[SPEAKER_00]: non-metals, they're called the halogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They combine easily with metals,
especially alkali metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have seven balanced electrons,
one short of a stable octet, and they tend
[SPEAKER_00]: to gain an electron to become stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these tend to form this negative one
ion.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tend to form a positive one ion.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tend to form a negative one ion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrogen's kind of on its own there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most common element in the
universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's chemical failure by itself because it
behaves so differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reacts with most other elements,
rarely found in the free state in nature,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it has one balanced electron here,
as you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the Hindenburg was filled with
hydrogens, very reactive with oxygen gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helium, not he, helium, is used in blimps
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much less reactive than hydrogen to
reduce the chance of explosion in fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly here, just touching on some of the
major element families within the periodic
[SPEAKER_00]: table, are the noble gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Group 18 is all the way on the right-hand
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a very low reactivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a filled valence shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: S and P levels in the highest pin until
any level are also full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very stable electron configuration.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, they tend to be used in
signs, weather balloons, airships such as
[SPEAKER_00]: blimps.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you see here, a neon sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neon is a noble gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: As is helium, xenon, lights typically
found in cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very bright as a noble gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very low reactivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can add electricity to it and it glows
instead of exploding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this was a good general
overview of the periodic table so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: develop a better understanding of just why
it's organized the way that it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
