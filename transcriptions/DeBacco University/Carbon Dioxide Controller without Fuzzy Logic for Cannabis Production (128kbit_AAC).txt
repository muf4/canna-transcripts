[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this DeBacco University video,
I'm going to look at a carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: controller that does not have fuzzy logic
and provide you with some details about
[SPEAKER_00]: this style of CO2 controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at a carbon dioxide
controller without fuzzy logic for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what would these be used
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And while they can be used with bottle
systems, they're probably best utilized
[SPEAKER_00]: for carbon dioxide generators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even if your controller does have
a fuzzy logic, which I'll mention here at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end, it needs to be turned off if
you're using a generator, as this will not
[SPEAKER_00]: work with this type of CO2 generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only bottle-based systems should be
utilizing fuzzy logic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we can see the generator is an
on-off system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bottle systems allow for pulse dosing,
which you cannot use with a generator
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different forms of generator
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here we've invented here,
here, and here we have one in a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at these
controllers, they are set up much in the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that ones would be with fuzzy logic,
in the sense that you would set a dead
[SPEAKER_00]: band.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's a dead band?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this setting decides how tight you
want the controller to keep the carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide levels to the target set point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, how far the controller will
allow carbon dioxide levels to deviate
[SPEAKER_00]: from your chosen setting before targeting
your carbon dioxide source to switch on or
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most controllers default around 50 parts
per million, but you may want to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: this to 100 parts per million for a
generator system, as it will naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: fluctuate the levels more than a
bottle-based system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selecting 100 parts per million as your
dead band setting will allow the gross
[SPEAKER_00]: base levels to be essentially over or
under by 100 parts per million before the
[SPEAKER_00]: controller would turn on or off the
generator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we'll notice the one, the controller
over here next to me has a dead band
[SPEAKER_00]: setting set to 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a little tight to run for a
generator because it's going to have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more ons and off cycles, which could add a
necessary wear and tear to your generator.
[SPEAKER_00]: When in doubt, start with 50 and you can
regulate from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going as low as 25 is possible,
but it might see your generator running on
[SPEAKER_00]: and off with greater frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure on the sensors of your
controller that there is a presence of a
[SPEAKER_00]: photocell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that labeled right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help ensure that CO2 is only
added during the light period,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is only when the plant can actually
utilize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A timer could be used if you have a
regimen light schedule, but the photocell
[SPEAKER_00]: is a great fail-safe option to ensure
carbon dioxide is only added when the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants can actually use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers, some controllers had
growers try to dial in the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: so if light's on, light's off period,
but the photocell is great for kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: forgetting about the exact time or setting
in case timers were a little off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're growing in a high tunnel
or greenhouse environment, this can also
[SPEAKER_00]: allow the controller to automatically
adjust the seasonal changes in duration of
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight or photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what is this fuzzy logic that you'd
be missing out on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, keep in mind that fuzzy logic can
maximize a growing cycle with bottle-based
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it simply does is it allows for
continuous adjustment to automatically
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why this can be used with
bottle-based systems is the controller
[SPEAKER_00]: will automatically adjust the frequency
and duration of its pulse dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not possible with generators
because they need to be on or off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind that if you are
looking at potentially going into using a
[SPEAKER_00]: generator for now, but looking at a bottle
system down the road, make sure you get
[SPEAKER_00]: one with fuzzy logic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fuzzy logic can be utilized when
using the bottle-based system,
[SPEAKER_00]: but make sure that fuzzy logic is off or
you get a controller that does not have
[SPEAKER_00]: fuzzy logic if you're only going to be
using a generated source of carbon dioxide.
