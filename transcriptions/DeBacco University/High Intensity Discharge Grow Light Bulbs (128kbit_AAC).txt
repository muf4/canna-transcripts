[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I want to talk about
high-intensity discharge grow light bulbs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and here's an example of one right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hopefully understand them just a
little bit more after this lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, HED bulbs, insulation, and removal
will never directly touch the bulb as the
[SPEAKER_00]: oils of your hands could weaken the glass
and increase the odds of breaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, using plastic gloves in addition to
paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also here, putting them on paper towel
right from the start to ensure you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go and touch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're looking at removing the
bulb, make sure that it is not warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure it's fully cooled
before you're even going through and
[SPEAKER_00]: touching it with anything before you're
removing it from the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the bulb breaks, hopefully you're not
in the area when it does, you want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you turn off electricity as soon as
you realize it and give it sufficient time
[SPEAKER_00]: to cool off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then to remove it, because there will be
shards of glass, you want to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: potato, cut it in half, take the flat side
and jam it against the broken shards of
[SPEAKER_00]: glass, and while still holding onto the
potato, you want to then turn to loosen
[SPEAKER_00]: the bulb that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very safe way to remove a bulb that
has broken, which is not a good condition
[SPEAKER_00]: to be in, but it is a safe way to help
remove that bulb with minimal chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: damage to yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you replace the bulbs, well,
lumen output will degrade over time,
[SPEAKER_00]: resulting in less heat and poorer growing
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to document the day, the month,
and the year of purchase if your grocer
[SPEAKER_00]: does not do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you purchase it, bulb replacement is
often debated, but check with the stated
[SPEAKER_00]: life of the bulb you're using,
and then by having that documentation of
[SPEAKER_00]: that day, that month, and that year,
that allows you to make a judgment of how
[SPEAKER_00]: long many hours you're running in a day
and what the expected life would be of
[SPEAKER_00]: that bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure you have some bulbs
on hand, and that means you need to match
[SPEAKER_00]: up with whatever type of fixture you're
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep some spirits on hand, replacing bulbs
after 68 months is not unheard of,
[SPEAKER_00]: and depending what type of light you're
running, do not look at the bulb while
[SPEAKER_00]: it's on, turn it off a lot to cool,
and then inspect the arc tube for a cloudy
[SPEAKER_00]: or dark discoloration if you're not sure
how old the bulb is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will indicate that you need to change
the bulb when they get that kind of arcing
[SPEAKER_00]: and that blackness there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers will even keep extra fixtures
on hand in case a ballast goes out,
[SPEAKER_00]: but make sure you're having definitely
plenty of extra bulbs, especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're running many of the same light
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a debate between single and
double-ended bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a single-ended, this is a
double-ended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Single-ended produce less heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're better fit for smaller areas with
low ceiling height, and they're typically
[SPEAKER_00]: used in grow tent operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double-ended, as we see the DE,
this is single-ended and double-ended,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are typically used for large-scale
production as they produce more heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're getting more light for the same
energy, and as a result, these are
[SPEAKER_00]: typically used in larger areas or grow
rooms than the single-ended ones are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both are very effective, but looking
at just maximizing that fission and see
[SPEAKER_00]: that much more in a large area that you
can cool, the double-ended is the way to
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
Thanks for watching.
I'll see you next time.
