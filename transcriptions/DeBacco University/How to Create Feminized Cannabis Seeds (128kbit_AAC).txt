[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tobacco University, we're going to
answer the question, how do you create
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized cannabis seeds, and walk you
through some of the scientific literature
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting this protocol, and also provide
you with some of the details on how to
[SPEAKER_00]: create the proper ratio of silver-style
sulfate if you want to do this on your own
[SPEAKER_00]: here on Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's get into the video of
how to create feminized cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's that reference article if you
want to look at some more of the details,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to provide just a brief kind
of summary where we're oriented,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you want to look at the original
study, this is all the proper citations
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with where the information was
originated from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, basics of creating feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in order to produce all female seed,
what's required is the induction of female
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to develop male flowers that
produce pollen that will be genetically
[SPEAKER_00]: female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, female sex chromosomes are an X and
an X.
[SPEAKER_00]: A male sex chromosomes are an X and a Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, when a female plant,
which is XX, is induced to form pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: since there are no Y chromosome,
all the resulting pollen will be the XX.
[SPEAKER_00]: When pollinated with a known female plant,
which will also be XX, this will result in
[SPEAKER_00]: the offspring also being female,
and this is the basics for creating
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do you induce male flowers on a
female plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems like an obvious question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, 3-millimolar silver thiosulfate,
abbreviated SDS, was applied as a foliar
[SPEAKER_00]: spray on three occasions seven days apart
to produce male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 3-millimolar SDS treatment was shown
on four strains of female hemp having a
[SPEAKER_00]: THC content of equal to or less than 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those different strains were
designated CBD Hemp A, CBD Hemp B,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD Hemp C, and Industrial Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the specifics of this
study?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, their materials and methods,
they used rooted cuttings that were about
[SPEAKER_00]: six inches high with two shoots when
foliar sprays of the SDS were applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silver thiosulfate solutions at 0.3 and
3-millimolar were prepared by mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: silver nitrate with SDS in a molar ratio
of 1 to 4, and this is per previous study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if yours is kind of getting a little
scientific for you, if you wait till the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the slideshow, I will show you the
exact process of preparation steps to make
[SPEAKER_00]: that 3-millimolar silver thiosulfate
solution, and I'll walk down the steps on
[SPEAKER_00]: how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I walk you through the
3-millimolar is that's what was shown to
[SPEAKER_00]: be most effective in this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants were sprayed till runoff,
which was about 20 milliliters per plant
[SPEAKER_00]: on three occasions, seven days apart,
being on April 30th, the year 2018,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the first replication, and on the 14th
of May, 2018, for the second replication
[SPEAKER_00]: of this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Control plants receive sprays of water
only to act as that kind of nice control
[SPEAKER_00]: in this scientific experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the 30th of April and the 14th of May,
plants begin receiving short-day
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions of about eight hours using
blackout curtain to initiate the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what were the general study results
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're kind of doing this comparison
of the study results, between 14 and 21
[SPEAKER_00]: days after the first SDS spray treatment,
plants transitioned from first flowers to
[SPEAKER_00]: full flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most complete inflorescence conversion
to male flowers occurred at the
[SPEAKER_00]: 3-millimolar SDS for all hemp strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 3-millimolar SDS, the majority of
inflorescence had 100% male flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the remaining inferences had 75% male
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Untreated control plants, or all four hemp
strains, produce only female flowers as
[SPEAKER_00]: expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just this again shows you the actual
numbers here, shows the actual percent of
[SPEAKER_00]: male inflorescence, shows you the
different treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if they were not treated,
you could see that there were no induction
[SPEAKER_00]: of male flowers, which would be expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see the greatest percentage here
at that three millimolar SDS treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, however, it's important to note that
during this study, that male flowers that
[SPEAKER_00]: developed on genetically female plants did
produce pollen, so that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the pollen did not appear to be
as plentiful or freely released as
[SPEAKER_00]: observed on truly genetic male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an important distinction to make
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen did produce seed, which was
harvested, germinated, and exposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: short-day conditions, and resulting plants
were confirmed to be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great kind of conclusion of
the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be aware, if you're used to growing
traditional male plants, while there is
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen produced, it's going to be slightly
different, but still can produce viable
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's a possible explanation for this,
you know, SDS?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this kind of, you know,
why is this showing to be effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, ethylene blocking by SDS,
which ethylene is another plant hormone,
[SPEAKER_00]: is likely responsible for the production
of male flowers on female hemp plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: our study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one that I'm referring to that
I cited at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's genetically believed that ethylene
blocking is extended when a series of
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays of SDS is used compared to a single
spray of SDS, and that's based on a
[SPEAKER_00]: previous study found in this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be possible to induce male flowers
on genetically female hemp using other
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene-perceived inhibition chemicals,
but this shows here that SDS can have an
[SPEAKER_00]: effect and could be a very notable effect
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the general conclusion of this
study?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this study demonstrated that male
flowers can be produced easily and
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently on female plants through
application of foliar sprays of SDS under
[SPEAKER_00]: short-day conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, SDS at 3 millimolar was the most
effective treatment for producing the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest number of male flowers on female
hemp plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not observe any plants'
phytotoxicity or delay in flower
[SPEAKER_00]: development, which is, again, another
great plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthermore, we were able to achieve 95 to
100% conversion male flowers for all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the hemp strains produced here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just shows you some pictures from the
study provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you're probably wondering at this
point, well, how could I create a
[SPEAKER_00]: 3-millimolar concentration of SDS?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here I provided you with how to
exactly go about preparing that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: dilution rate and solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I give all the information here,
so it's important to probably pause the
[SPEAKER_00]: video here, print this out, take a
screenshot, or utilize the information
[SPEAKER_00]: provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to make note of kind of a key
point is that as you're going through and
[SPEAKER_00]: reading this, note, always add the,
this is the silver nitrate solution to the
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium thiosulfate solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opposite will create a black
precipitate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when we're mixing things, getting into
the chemistry, it's very important the
[SPEAKER_00]: order that you mix things and what you mix
into what.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, to use a 3-millimolar solution here
for spraying cucumber plants, this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: the example was given for this survey that
I found, the resulting study.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to dilute to 3-millimolar
solution by mixing the 6-millimolar
[SPEAKER_00]: solution with double distilled water in a
one-to-one ratio and store it in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this does make a slightly more
concentrated solution, but then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to dilute that down to the
3-millimolar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, it's important to go through,
make sure you have precise ways to measure
[SPEAKER_00]: things, make sure everything is cleaned
ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want any chance of any
cross-contamination here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray plants in the third to fifth leaf
stage for terminal flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use two light squirts from the spray
bottle, mix two applications one week
[SPEAKER_00]: apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was used in a cucumber plant
study, but as we just saw here,
[SPEAKER_00]: this same process and procedure directly
applies to the creation of feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: on cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, wish you the best of luck and hope
that this is successful, or at least that
[SPEAKER_00]: this provides you some information on how
to create feminized seeds on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
