[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at,
as the title suggests, isotopes and
[SPEAKER_00]: half-life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we've got to define what an
isotope is.
[SPEAKER_00]: All atoms of an element have the same
number of protons, which is an important
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to remember, but may have different
number of neutrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isotopes are two atoms of an element that
differ in the number of neutrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind the number of protons will
define the element.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see here, our three examples here
are all hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hydrogen because they each have
one proton.
[SPEAKER_00]: They each also have one electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're only looking at the change in
the number of neutrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here there's no neutrons, protium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here there's one neutron, deuterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have two neutrons,
teridium.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all examples of isotopes of the
element hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now isotopes, there's also reactive
isotopes and radioactive isotopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some that are definitely a lot
more likely to be radioactive,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not all elements necessarily have
radioactive isotopes that at least occur
[SPEAKER_00]: in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the half-life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the time required for the amount of
radioactive material to decrease by half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're looking at some take a very
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some take a very short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the radioactive nuclei are time,
half-life, the time it takes for half of
[SPEAKER_00]: the material to decay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this same general trend will be for all
the elements we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time it takes, though, this time
measurement is going to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this time it takes for half the
material to decay for uranium-238 is 4.5
[SPEAKER_00]: billion years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So extremely long period of time for half
that material to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon-14, as that time it takes this
distance, would be 5,730 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get to like some other like
potassium-40, 1.25 billion years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want you to think they always
take a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bismuth-214, this half-life will only last
about 19.7 million years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way down to very unstable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lasts well, well under a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the graph will look the same,
but the time distance will be very
[SPEAKER_00]: different depending on the particular
isotope that you're dealing with based on
[SPEAKER_00]: the element.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at here, decay of
carbon-14.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see our sample in years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Percentage of carbon-14 atoms,
we start at 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half-life of our carbon-14 numbers,
5,730 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to reach 50%, here would be about
5,730.
[SPEAKER_00]: To decrease 50% by half would be about 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see 5,730 plus 5,730, just over our
10,000 here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we notice that that trend continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here the dots that are disappearing
throughout the half-life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We very rarely reach zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get very, very close.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're always dividing by two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we get this general curve that
occurs when we're referring to half-life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, our applications are radioactive
isotopes through dating fossils,
[SPEAKER_00]: tracing atoms through metabolic processes,
and diagnosing medical disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: These half-lives that we have,
we're able to put in the body that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely radioactive or deadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can trace and track where things may go
through the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know carbon-14, for example,
the body or the plant is going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: that in as regular carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the more shorter isotopes or
half-lives that we deal with for isotopes,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll be able to track and see where those
are in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body's not going to recognize it as,
oh, that's an isotope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to treat it like it was a
normal element.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows us to track and see
through these radiographs here,
[SPEAKER_00]: these scans.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is iodine-123 to see where that may
accumulate in the body, what organs,
[SPEAKER_00]: what tissues that may accumulate in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking specifically at carbon-14,
and it's a very long half-life.
[SPEAKER_00]: 5,730 years, as we say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, that's good for fossil dating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not great for radiology here because it's
so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're able to track, well,
how old were those rocks?
[SPEAKER_00]: How old were those fossils or plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: That allows us to give us an idea based on
that decay that occurs when that first
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon was assimilated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this helps explain a little bit
about isotopes and half-life for you.
Thank you.
