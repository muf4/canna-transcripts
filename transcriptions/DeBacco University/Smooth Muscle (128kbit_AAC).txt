[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this video lectures and we'll look
at smooth muscle in a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So smooth muscle, this is how it would
look under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we're looking at here,
and here's the same image, cells are long
[SPEAKER_00]: and spindle shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: They each contain a single nucleus and
cellular microfilaments are loosely
[SPEAKER_00]: organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We often call these sheets of cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at this image, it might be a
little hard to be able to tell that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at the kind of representation
image here, we see these distinct features
[SPEAKER_00]: coming into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a relaxed smooth muscle cell is going
to look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say they're kind of long spindle shaped,
this is kind of what we mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're contracted, they take on this
kind of bunched up appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of take this kind of clumpy look
here versus their normal relaxed spindle
[SPEAKER_00]: shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where is smooth muscle found?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it's found in the walls of blood
vessels, the stomach, and the intestines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, if you were to take a cross
section, this is what it would look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the nucleus is one per cell and it's
centrally located in each cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smooth muscle cell is elongated,
spindle shaped, and much smaller than a
[SPEAKER_00]: skeletal muscle cell if you were to
compare the two directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That relaxed shape, that spindle shape,
and then here's that contracted,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of bunched look.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage of smooth muscle is it
provides powerful rhythmic involuntary
[SPEAKER_00]: contractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is helpful to move food through the
stomach, through the intestines,
[SPEAKER_00]: to help blood go through the vessels.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these things are very important and
this involuntary means we don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're known for their slow, sustained
contractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're timeless meaning they're
non-voluntary control, they just happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do contain actin and myosin filaments
but lack sarcomeres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And predominant locations are wall of the
GI tract, that's the gastrointestinal
[SPEAKER_00]: tract, walls of the arteries and veins,
and around glands is typically where
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll find these smooth muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though we don't have direct
control over them, they do provide us with
[SPEAKER_00]: some very necessary everyday functions of
the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
