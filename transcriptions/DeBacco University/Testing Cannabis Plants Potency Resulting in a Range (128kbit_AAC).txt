[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
we're going to be looking at testing
[SPEAKER_00]: canvas plants' potency with the resulting
data provided as a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this may not typically be seen,
we're going to go over why that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: important to be considering the potency of
canvas plants in a range and not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily a single defined number.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into testing canvas
plants' potency resulting in a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see that represented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at percentage weight over
total weight for THCA, THC, and total.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see all these little data points.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that while the hard line here
might be the number provided, we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: the variability that might exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we need to be considering this
final product as a range and not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily just one single defined
chemical number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Providing that range, well, with actual
plant product material that's tested,
[SPEAKER_00]: a range is to be really expected as
there's no two flowers that are exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: alike, even if they come from the same
plant grown in the exact same conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This seems to be logical when it comes to
understanding the plant, but a range can
[SPEAKER_00]: make regulation as well as compliance with
laws and standards much more challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why there is such a push for the
results to be expressed as a single
[SPEAKER_00]: number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to learn more about that,
I have another video on describing the
[SPEAKER_00]: single number idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here we see THC of 19.7 to 22.2% range
provided, CBD provided as a range,
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is a plant product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has some slight degree of variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that range will not be very
broad, but it is kind of unfair to
[SPEAKER_00]: represent it as an exact number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're particularly looking at dry
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the premium cannabis end product is dry
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people like this because of the
unique properties of each and the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that they often get to select the one,
the ones here that they exactly want.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this variability makes providing
a consistent number a challenge in regards
[SPEAKER_00]: to potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason why numbers provided
should be expressed as a general range.
[SPEAKER_00]: No two flowers will be exactly alike.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're grown in slightly different
portions of the plant, slightly different
[SPEAKER_00]: light exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference between them should be
minimal, but they still will be a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference, which is the advocation for
the expression of cannabis plant potency
[SPEAKER_00]: as a range instead of a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as mentioned, that does make
regulations very challenging and laws that
[SPEAKER_00]: want to have a set fixed point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need that number to kind of go
online and match that set of regulation or
[SPEAKER_00]: law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's part of the challenge is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just want you to understand here as
part of your cannabis education,
[SPEAKER_00]: that dry flower probably, while maybe
expressed as a number, might be more
[SPEAKER_00]: accurately represented as a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
