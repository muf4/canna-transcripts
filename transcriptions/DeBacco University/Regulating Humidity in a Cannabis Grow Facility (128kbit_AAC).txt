[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to go over regulating humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: in a cannabis grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over some of the
complexities and understand a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: better, regulating humidity in a cannabis
grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, humidity is the measure of water
vapor in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people think it's unavoidable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while this is true to some extent,
if humidity goes unregulated, the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: could become more likely to get powdery
mildew or bud rot if levels are too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could also suffer from leaf burn or
water stress if the levels become too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the optimum humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's going to actually depend on the
stage of growth of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clones and vegetative are typically
higher levels of humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the plant ages in the flowering and
final weeks of flowering, the humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: level or ideal humidity levels begins to
decrease there for a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to control humidity, you need control
over the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to gain better control over the growing
environment, growers need to isolate their
[SPEAKER_00]: grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But air circulation is also still
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to create this kind of sealed
up bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have a way of regulating this
and a way to kind of monitor the airflow
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sealing off and insulating the grow area
is one way to get isolation from the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's important, regardless of the
outside conditions, to make sure you are
[SPEAKER_00]: still having air movement within the
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature regulation also impacts
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about humidity,
that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want to look at how humidity and
air temp kind of play off one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature regulation is important for
the plants in general, but how this is
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplished can impact the humidity
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: For air conditioning units, make sure the
unit is sized appropriately to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of large temperature swings from a
unit that is either too large or too small
[SPEAKER_00]: for the growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to have your unit run for
consistent cycles for longer durations to
[SPEAKER_00]: moderate the temperature changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it to get too hot and get
too cold and get too hot and get too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to kind of keep it at a even keel
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Avoid short on and off cycles,
which will reduce the life expectancy of
[SPEAKER_00]: your air conditioning unit and is also not
beneficial to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're going to wear your unit out
quicker, but you're also not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit the plants in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're seeing when we take our air
temperature and decrease our air
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature running from 28 degrees
Celsius to 24, just that change in
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature can also impact the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see our relative humidity
acceptable range here changing with the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that temperature in humidity,
we're looking at the vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: deficit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature humidity are inversely
proportional.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the temperature goes down,
the humidity is on the increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why swings in temperature impact
humidity as well, which will relate to
[SPEAKER_00]: potential disease pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal for your facility should be
consistency, monitoring your levels and
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing what levels are your target levels
so you can be aware that you are within
[SPEAKER_00]: that acceptable range.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, the importance of air
circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oscillating fans are a good start,
but a room with a dense canopy floor fans
[SPEAKER_00]: may also be needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to maintain consistency across
all portions of a fully grown plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want to have good air circulation
at the bottom or good air circulation at
[SPEAKER_00]: the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure we're mixing that air
in a vertical sense as well as in a
[SPEAKER_00]: horizontal sense, because air circulation
is still important at all stages of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are using water tanks, you want to
make sure that they are being covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to be checking your water
drains because to limit the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: water that may naturally enter a grow
space, be sure to cover any water
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoirs you may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have this artificially
increasing level of humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also make sure that the drains are
actually draining excess water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a large puddle on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that water is getting to that
drain and going actually down the drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these may seem obvious,
but are still worth mentioning and always
[SPEAKER_00]: worth that double check to ensure that
your reservoirs, if you have any,
[SPEAKER_00]: are sealed and your drains are draining
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: For additional help, you might want to use
a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dehumidifiers remove moisture from the
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: These units may be needed more during the
mid to late portions of the growing season
[SPEAKER_00]: because the increase in plant matter that
you should have in your growing facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that it is a commercial grade,
not a residential homeowner, grade
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Residential models, while cheaper,
are also electrically inefficient and do
[SPEAKER_00]: not hold up under the workload of a grow
room with a lot of transpiration occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A proper dehumidifier will save you money
in the long run, though proper humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: control and as a result to reduce
potential loss from disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need a dehumidifier, you get a
commercial one, one set or sized for your
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can really save you a lot in the long
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where does this humidity come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about and it's from the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, plants transpire about 97% of the
water they absorb.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of the water comes up and out the
stomata of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers are suggested to have multiple
units to properly regulate the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have one big unit in the
corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have multiple units to ensure
that there's an even distribution or
[SPEAKER_00]: control over the humidity in a growing
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple units offer that more even
control over this overall over a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: space and also redundancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one unit was to fail, the entire grow
space does not fail with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have that kind of backup and systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, others might be a little overworked,
but at least you won't lose the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in the opposite situation
where you want to increase the humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: levels, you want to use a humidifier and
these can produce a constant flow of water
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor for an indoor garden, which may be
needed if natural air is especially dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be particularly to your region.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because if you're using heaters,
it could naturally dry out the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool water is used to create a mist that
dissipates throughout the space and
[SPEAKER_00]: increases those moisture levels again to
bring them up to your desired target
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, avoid competing systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting both a temperature and humidity
in balance can be a difficult task.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, knowing the natural conditions of
your outside air may help you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust your light cycles to be during the
natural night of the day to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: heat of the lights compounded with the
heat of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing in a completely
indoor space, those plants are isolated
[SPEAKER_00]: from the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because the sun's out doesn't mean
your lights have to be on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can help kind of absorb some of that
heat, some of those differences by having
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants essentially experiencing the
daytime during what would be the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: nighttime when it's cooler out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are different ways that growers
can manipulate completely controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor situations to try to reduce the
stress on the equipment and systems to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to maintain the target humidity as well as
temperature levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: In their grow space to help maximize plant
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
