[SPEAKER_00]: Here, I'm going to go over pruning of
cannabis, and while there may be different
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques, for the most part,
in the end, the goal is the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of trim out the plant to make it
more productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at plant pruning in general,
it involves selectively removing portions
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant with the goal to allow the
plant to not only put its energy into
[SPEAKER_00]: parts that will produce its greatest
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to cut off the ones that are just
not going to produce well, so it can focus
[SPEAKER_00]: its energy elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different methods can result in different
flowering times, so keep that in mind that
[SPEAKER_00]: if you are switching a pruning method,
it could adjust your entire growth cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: and your flowering times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be sure to clean your tools
and wash them frequently to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for cross-contamination as you
move from plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one plant does have an internal
vascular disease, you don't want to have
[SPEAKER_00]: your tools be the transmission to go
through and infect all the plants down
[SPEAKER_00]: that row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, while it can be fun to prune
initially, and you're kind of enjoying
[SPEAKER_00]: removing plant material, don't get prune
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And create what I call the Charlie Brown
plant, where you look back at the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and go, ooh, probably shouldn't have taken
that much off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind also.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal for pruning is you want to remove
the weak branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can be referred to as freshening
up the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: These poor yielding portions should be
removed because they're hurting your
[SPEAKER_00]: yields overall, and they themselves are
not going to produce all that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deader dying leaves should be removed,
like the one pictured here, on a regular
[SPEAKER_00]: basis, again, to reduce the chance of
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is technically a form of pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to discard these leaves away from
the main crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by removing these leaves and weak
branches in general, you can also increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the air circulation in your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all great benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say, well, I'm not going to
prune.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the downfall if I just kind of let
the plant grow and do its own thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this can increase plant density,
which is advantageous in small spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's most beneficial if your plants are
growing under three feet tall in a short
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are options where you potentially
can get away with not pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not really the most efficient
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should still take care to remove older
leaves that are browning, as those could
[SPEAKER_00]: harbor disease or potential for insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall when you don't prune is you
have this kind of situation that could
[SPEAKER_00]: develop, where you have poor air
circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many leaves will not get adequate light
penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could reduce the productivity of the
plant in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: To also get into some cases here,
we have the opposite, where if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: prune, plants can get really leggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not kind of pruning them to kind of
take away the apical maritim to make them
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of grow outward.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a potential another downfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, depending what cultivar or what
plant stock you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also plant topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: This involves removal of the main shoot to
create two strong growing shoots to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So removal of the apical dominant,
or that main stock, is advantageous
[SPEAKER_00]: because then you can have now a two liter
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is common for point sedius,
and this is referred to as pinching the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will remove the presence of a dense
top bud, but overall yield will not be
[SPEAKER_00]: that negatively impacted because now
you're going to have more buds growing off
[SPEAKER_00]: these branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the four liter system is kind of like
what I just showed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of easy to do it twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remove the top dominant apical maritim and
allow for four main branches to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal here is to produce a large dense
bud at the flower tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Training these newly developed four liters
is needed to maximize the benefits of this
[SPEAKER_00]: pruning style.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this does require a little bit
of a commitment throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to kind of set your plant up
early for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the FIM technique,
and it stands for F-I Mist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of clearly removing the top
growth, like I showed in the previous one,
[SPEAKER_00]: just below the bud, the traditional
method, the bottom 10% of the bud is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually going to remain with this
technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows for different growing tops to
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of see that it's evident here a
little bit, a little zoomed in version
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can induce the emergence of eight or
more branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is beneficial in producing many
branches, especially if you're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often used with what's called the
screen of green style of growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but very common for cloning, simply
because you have so many branch points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone would say, well, we just
don't want to have all these branch points
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can have more branch points,
correct, but it could potentially reduce a
[SPEAKER_00]: total size of each of those buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the bending of the plants,
less stress on plants and pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as the name implies, the branches are
bent to the ground and staked in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be used to kind of jump plants
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called tip propagation, used with
raspberries sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not quite the full bending of
plants technique, but gives you the idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of kind of setting that plant up
potentially to go to that technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's more common to have plants that
they get close to the light source with a
[SPEAKER_00]: limited ceiling height.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have that one branch that's getting
a little bit high, kind of bend that
[SPEAKER_00]: branch over to keep it away from the
light, but not lose anything on that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular side shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the sea of green, SOG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focuses on flowering plants early can be
done at one foot or about 30 centimeters
[SPEAKER_00]: tall, with the goal of producing fewer,
but larger buds, which is kind of an
[SPEAKER_00]: example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commonly found in grow spaces that are
growing at a high plant density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the screen of green,
and this uses mesh or screen netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's layered horizontally, you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Above the plants and the growing tips grow
through that material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, plants must remain in
vegetative state a little bit longer,
[SPEAKER_00]: several more weeks than the previous sea
of green that I had mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is an outdoor operation,
a little bit better for this area,
[SPEAKER_00]: not quite as height limited, a little bit
longer growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you have to choose what fits
your particular operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something called lollipopping,
and this is a technique that involves
[SPEAKER_00]: removing the lower growth of the plant
that receives little to no light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this down the whole grow
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to have plants make the most
use of energy it produces by having it
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on the upper buds and branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timing of the photoperiod flip is based on
cultivar and height for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make the flips for indicas about three,
three and a half feet to provide more time
[SPEAKER_00]: for the vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_00]: In sativas, you typically want to flip
maybe a little bit earlier there,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost sometimes half the height,
since they can grow much taller during the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be a little bit specific to the
particular cultivars you are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: within the indicas or the sativa
classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, here we have supercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to produce very heavy yields
with minimal number of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's accomplished this by the plants that
yield, that are held higher in the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative phase longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supercropping involves bending the upper
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here this 90 degree angle,
occurs right here, down to allow for more
[SPEAKER_00]: light to reach deeper into the lower parts
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: By keeping the plant material away from
the lights, this allows the extended
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative phase with minimal leaf burn,
and this is referred to as supercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
