[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at the high-intensity
discharge grow light ballast, and what
[SPEAKER_00]: those are are the areas here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the cooling fins.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the electricity is plugged
into, and this is what feeds the bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in the background here a
different type of ballast by a different
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a ceramic metal halide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see by the cleaner, whiter look to
the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a high-pressure sodium by its
yellow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these HID light, these ballasts that
are required to have, these ballasts
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate the wire voltage for a specific
lamp setup, and be sure to purchase
[SPEAKER_00]: quality ballasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's highly recommended you purchase the
entire system at once, reduce the risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: fire from mixing and matching different
components together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times, manufacturers now are
kind of selling it all-inclusive,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you do buy a separate ballast,
be sure everything is compatible that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're buying at the time of purchase,
so you don't have a mix match and just
[SPEAKER_00]: increase your potential for fire hazard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping your ballast cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, heat is a great contributor to the
aging of ballasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep them in an area that allows for
cooling and air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them away from potential sources of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a lot of growth
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of typically tanks of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure your ballasts are
mounted clear and far away from these
[SPEAKER_00]: sources, not where water will be present,
but also where humidity could be high.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's magnetic and there's electronic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnets have greater noise and weight
compared to electronic ballasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fail with smoke and a horrible odor,
and these are really being phased out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electronic fail by simply stop working,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much preferred because they run cooler and
quieter than the magnetic ballasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ballast locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We mentioned you want to keep them away
from water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So traditional thought was to mount them
outside the room to make cooling easier,
[SPEAKER_00]: but due to line loss in the power,
the lights do not work as efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all-in-one ballast bulb and reflector
units are kind of the standard,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having all our ballasts,
all our lights all together versus putting
[SPEAKER_00]: them in the hallway here where it's easier
to cool while running that power all with
[SPEAKER_00]: those lights in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might just be another side of the wall,
but that requires line loss, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing the efficiency of those lights
and increasing power consumption without
[SPEAKER_00]: an increase necessarily in the yield or
the amount of power that's produced by
[SPEAKER_00]: those lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now these all-in-one options are by far
the preferred way to go.
Let's take a look.
