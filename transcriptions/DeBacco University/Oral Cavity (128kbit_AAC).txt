[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to learn a little
bit more about the oral cavity,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at some of the details that occur
in our mouth in relation to the digestive
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with functions of the oral
cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's sensory analysis of the
material before swallowing, recognition,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of determining texture, mechanical
processing, which occurs through the teeth
[SPEAKER_00]: and the surfaces in the oral cavity,
lubrication is occurring with mucus and
[SPEAKER_00]: salivary gland secretions, and there's
some digestion that's limited but mainly
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrates and some lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salivary amylase is one of the key enzymes
that's produced and that is starting the
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdown of carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever had a cracker and just kind of
kept it in your mouth, eventually it would
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of break down, turn into mush,
and ultimately liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did the same thing with like a
piece of gum or something high in fats,
[SPEAKER_00]: that same process will not happen because
you only have enzymes specific to
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrates and some minimal on lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, breaking down the food in the mouth,
many of you have already have teeth that
[SPEAKER_00]: allow for chewing, massification of the
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we're going to see a carnivore or
herbivore and an omnivore, looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars,
all color-coded appropriately here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the carnivore, those that only eat meat
see the noticeable incinus and the canines
[SPEAKER_00]: are very pronounced here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the example of our tiger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carnivores have pointed teeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're adapted for cutting and shearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herbivores, those plant eaters,
such as the deer, those have flat teeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see our molars and our premolars,
well suited for grinding of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: cellulose, help to kind of mechanically
break down the very complex cellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, notice their incisors and canines
are in very small amount here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually kind of a gap here in
their teeth as you have a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: premolars and molars for that breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then our omnivores, these have kind of the
teeth of the carnivores in the front and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of also the teeth of the herbivores
in the back to allow them to eat both meat
[SPEAKER_00]: and plant materials and be able to
efficiently break them down through the
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanical process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on to the tongue, the superior
surface of the tongue actually bears three
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of papillae.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the filiform, which is to give the
tongue the roughness and provide friction,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a lot of friction in the tongue so
you're able to move that food around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungiform is scattered widely over the
tongue and give it that reddish kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: hue as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Circumvalet is the V-shaped row in the
back of the tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of way towards the back
section there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our sulcus terminalis is the
groove here that separates the tongue into
[SPEAKER_00]: two areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the anterior two-thirds residing in
the oral cavity and the posterior third
[SPEAKER_00]: here residing in the oral phoenix,
which is important when we're starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: ingest our food as it begins its way or
its path through the digestive system.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the mouth, the tongue mixes the food in
solution called saliva.
[SPEAKER_00]: The saliva moistens and lubricates the
food, contains amylase, which,
[SPEAKER_00]: remember, is an enzyme that's important
for the breakdown of starch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starch is a collection here of glucose
molecules all linked together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amylase here is considered like starch
clipper, breaking down.
[SPEAKER_00]: A disaccharide of a polysaccharide of
cellulose could be maltose, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: monosaccharide of maltose would be
glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disaccharide being two glucoses linked
together, monosaccharide being one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, polydi and monosaccharides,
amylase breaking down, are starch,
[SPEAKER_00]: maltase breaking down, are maltose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, ASE at the end, important for
identifying potential enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the mouth, our salivary glands are
controlled by the nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see where they're located right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuous secretion of about 0.5
milliliters per minute keeps the mouth
[SPEAKER_00]: moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the presence of food, this triggers
an increase in the secretion rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why we want that increase in
secretion rate, we want to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: lubricate the food as it starts to enter
the digestive system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want an increased number of
enzymes that start breaking down some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the bolus has a ball-like mixture
of food and saliva that forms in the mouth
[SPEAKER_00]: during the process of chewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that bolus forming, so that's
going to be turned ultimately into chyme,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that chyme will be broken down into
nutrients, which will be absorbed,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all the leftover material will be
excreted from the body in the form of
[SPEAKER_00]: feces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the bolus reaches the stomach and
mixed with the gastric juices,
[SPEAKER_00]: it becomes chyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, it's kind of the same
collection of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: But depending where it's located and what
it's mixed with, that will change its
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking for identifying
certain areas, that same thing that is
[SPEAKER_00]: called a bolus up here, we call chyme once
it reaches the stomach and mixes with the
[SPEAKER_00]: gastric juices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Further digestion and absorption,
and eventually will be discharged again as
[SPEAKER_00]: feces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
