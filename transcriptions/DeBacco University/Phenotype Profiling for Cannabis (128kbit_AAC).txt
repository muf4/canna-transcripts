[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tobacco University video,
we'll be looking at phenotype profiling
[SPEAKER_00]: related to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, phenotype is how something
physically looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's morphology, how it looks to us when
it's growing as a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that phenohunting in general,
phenotypes are based on physical or visual
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is important to remember that these
traits can be influenced by the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions the plant is
exposed to, so they can potentially change
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant's phenotype based on what
environment it's growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, documentation is important
for growing in general, but it needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: include some extra details when it comes
to being applied to the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers should be extra careful,
take redundancies, take as many pictures,
[SPEAKER_00]: and document as many potential variables
that they can to be able to allow that
[SPEAKER_00]: screening process to occur very
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what are you going through in making
that selection?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the greater number of plants grown
makes it easier to find the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: standout.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing two plants, it's going
to be really hard to kind of phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing ten, a hundred,
a thousand, ten thousand, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: much easier as you get more plants because
then you can likely see one that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: a true genetic standout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the goal is to be able to
recognize the differences and the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants that you have grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be easy if you're looking for a
taller plant or one with greater
[SPEAKER_00]: branching, but may be more challenging if
you're looking at chemical profiles to be
[SPEAKER_00]: targeted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that is going to be a form of
phenohunting, but might be a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more difficult because you can't just look
out over a whole row of plants and see,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, one's genetically taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's maybe shorter, what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chemical profiles still can be done,
but a little bit more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the overall goal of phenohunting in
general is to select a few individual
[SPEAKER_00]: plants with the quote best traits and
continue to grow and propagate the select
[SPEAKER_00]: few.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put best in quotes because that's going
to relate to what the grower is deeming
[SPEAKER_00]: desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to continue to select the best of
the best by culling out or removing those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that do not fit the intended
breeding target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that breeding target may vary
based on different growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that phenotype selection process,
well, the selection process will take time
[SPEAKER_00]: and does require a long-term dedication
and careful attention to detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking clones from the selected phenotype
is the first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing these out and then making another
selection process will reduce the total
[SPEAKER_00]: number of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example, only physical
characteristics are determined in the
[SPEAKER_00]: selection process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The final phenotype will, at least
ideally, have the greatest amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: desirable plant habits or products or
whatever kind of traits the grower is
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of generations this takes is up
to the grower and refinement of the
[SPEAKER_00]: selected traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some might be done in a fewer generations,
some might take more generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be bred into another best of the
best selection or grown out to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the population of the selection particular
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's important to keep in mind
we see here original phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a whole bunch listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have those first generation clones,
we have the second generation clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we have the final phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we can see the OG K5.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can trace that lineage back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the many they made to this
first generation, second generation,
[SPEAKER_00]: although it was the final generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I'll say this might be a little
misleading simply because it will often
[SPEAKER_00]: take more than just two or three
generations to really get that one unique
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of selection for a process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be mindful, know what you're
looking for, importance of documentation
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you're able to be efficient with
your selection process as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: In hopes that you can get that final
unique phenotype you might be looking for.
