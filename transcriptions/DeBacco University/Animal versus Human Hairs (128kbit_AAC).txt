[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another video here on Tobacco
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, we're going to be looking
at animal versus human hairs and different
[SPEAKER_00]: regions when you want to look at and
inspect them and how a animal hair would
[SPEAKER_00]: compare to that of a human hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could hopefully distinguish between
the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, human or animal,
there are some general characteristics of
[SPEAKER_00]: each type of hair that can help initially
classify it as whether you're looking at a
[SPEAKER_00]: human hair or an animal hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you find something at the crime
scene, even though there may have been
[SPEAKER_00]: humans involved, you want to be able to
rule out or classify it as just human or
[SPEAKER_00]: animal in the general category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, animal versus human hair,
looking at the general size.
[SPEAKER_00]: For length, the human scalp hairs tend to
be longer than most animal hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Human hairs are usually in the range of
0.05 to 0.15 millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animal hairs can be narrower or coarser.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just that quick little comparison there
can help you initially start to classify
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of this comes with just seeing a lot
of samples as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now animal versus human hair, looking at
the pigmentation in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for human hairs, generally
consistent pigment throughout the hair
[SPEAKER_00]: shaft with a slight increase in density
towards the cuticle.
[SPEAKER_00]: For animal hairs, the color is more
centrally distributed throughout the more
[SPEAKER_00]: dense towards the medulla region.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the color banding.
[SPEAKER_00]: For human hairs, when untreated,
it can usually lack banding while animal
[SPEAKER_00]: hairs will have a banded appearance to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: For hair treatments, human hair can be
treated and animal hair really exhibits
[SPEAKER_00]: dying, bleaching, or other cosmetic
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep that in mind when you're
looking at investigating hair,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pigmentation portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at the medulla region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at kind of the
microscopic view of comparing these hair
[SPEAKER_00]: types.
[SPEAKER_00]: For human hairs, they only have an
amorphous medulla structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animal hairs can have a complex regular
geometric cellular medulla.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the medullary index, which is the
ratio of the diameter of the medulla to
[SPEAKER_00]: the diameter of the actual hair,
the human hair is almost always less than
[SPEAKER_00]: one third, and animal hair is usually
greater than one third, a lot of times
[SPEAKER_00]: often greater than one half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kind of see some examples here
identifying them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the buffalo, the camel,
the cow, the horse, the donkey,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sheep, the goat, the dog, and the cat
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this little sidebar here is 62 and a
half on my side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micrometers for comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now kind of the anatomy of the human hair
versus the animal hair I've provided you
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lot of kind of comparison points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking at the shaft region,
animal hairs tend to have different shapes
[SPEAKER_00]: than humans, such as that spatula shape
found in rodent hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the root of the hair,
well human hair will have a bulb or ribbon
[SPEAKER_00]: shaped root, while animal hairs tend to
have different shaped roots typically kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of brush-like in their appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the tip of the hair, particularly human
hair, of the scalp is usually cut or
[SPEAKER_00]: frayed at the tip, while animal hair is
usually that has that natural kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: taper to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at the scale region
of human hair, it only exhibits irregular,
[SPEAKER_00]: angular kind of scale patterns,
while animal hair will have a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: types and can have more than one type
within the same hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, looking at the cross-section,
animal hairs tend to have some more
[SPEAKER_00]: unusual shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, kind of like a dog bone-like
shape, which is evident of rabbit hair,
[SPEAKER_00]: as just one example, or a cigar shaped,
and that is evident that of a seal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are just some obvious kind of
cross-section shapes that can help you
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially identify or classify what
animal it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, there's a lot of
comparisons that can be made between human
[SPEAKER_00]: and animal hairs, and while humans may be
animals, we're looking at the different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of species of animals, and hopefully
this provides you with kind of some quick
[SPEAKER_00]: little regions to look at and how to
identify whether it's human or if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: animal hair.
