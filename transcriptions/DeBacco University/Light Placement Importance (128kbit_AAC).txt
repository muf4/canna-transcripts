[SPEAKER_00]: While it is important to select the proper
light to use, also how you place that
[SPEAKER_00]: light in relation to your plants is of
equal or sometimes even greater importance
[SPEAKER_00]: to ensure maximum yield without doing
excessive plant damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're mounting our lights,
use of quality ratchet hangers is advised
[SPEAKER_00]: for ease of installation and added
advantage of being able to adjust the
[SPEAKER_00]: height of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure the attachment rings are fully
encapsulated and not open S-curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are fully encapsulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you'll see some that sound like
an S and they just kind of hook on to
[SPEAKER_00]: different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not advised because those could easily
slip or if you bump the light cause the
[SPEAKER_00]: light to fall and damage you and or the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One minimum of an eighth inch but quarter
inch is preferred when you're going to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: these with each being able to support
about 150 pounds or so for the pair in
[SPEAKER_00]: this example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can always up it a little bit more,
always worth going a little bit higher,
[SPEAKER_00]: rating it a little bit lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the example here is if you pull
on the ratchet strap that will help
[SPEAKER_00]: increase on the height of this light and
that can be utilized well as the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: grow to maintain an equal distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now distance off of those lights to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light should be kept a constant distance
from the plants but remember that plants
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you fix the light in a certain area
it could be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using those ratchet straps will allow you
to raise the light as the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing which makes for great consistent
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important because the distance can
vastly reduce the light intensity which
[SPEAKER_00]: could cause plants to stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just mount the light really high
and say oh they can use diffused light,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're not getting enough light they
could stretch and that could cause all
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of issues as you get later in the
growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because there's an exponential
decay of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follows the inverse square law for light
as you increase the distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the relationship between light
source and the distance the light needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: travel and as we get further away in
distance we have an exponentially
[SPEAKER_00]: decreasing amount of light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intensity equals the output divided by the
distance squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because distance is squared that's the key
term here.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you an idea let's compare two
plants of the same light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant A is one foot away from that
light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant B is two feet away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's double the distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: However because it's the inverse square
law and distance is squared, plant B is
[SPEAKER_00]: not receiving half the light it's
receiving only 25% of the light that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: A is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that inverse square law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important that that distance
be maintained consistently because if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to get a little bit too far you
could see here how the amount of light is
[SPEAKER_00]: exponentially smaller because that
distance term is squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly closer to the light source isn't
always better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if a plant is close to the light
source it will burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds need to be taken into
consideration especially if for high
[SPEAKER_00]: intense lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plasmas also are advised or LEPs are
advised to be at least two feet away to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again just because we're close to the
light source isn't always been the case
[SPEAKER_00]: but when in fluorescence definitely want
those closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that closer is not always
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the type of light you're
using in the stage of plant growth.
