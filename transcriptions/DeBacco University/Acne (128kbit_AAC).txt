[SPEAKER_00]: So this video lecture series is going to
talk about something you may have
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with, and that's acne.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to provide you with some of the
science and give you some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: background on what causes this skin
irritation that's very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I want to provide you with
some resources for some more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've pulled some of my information
directly from here, and I'm going to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of cover it briefly, and you're welcome to
check out these scientists for more
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I provide you with the links to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, remember that acne is one of
the most common skin diseases with about
[SPEAKER_00]: 17 million Americans affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the data in U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: research, close to 100% of people between
the ages of 12 and 17 have acne,
[SPEAKER_00]: and genetics do play a role, but they're
not the sole or potentially only cause of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people were surveyed, about 503 here,
and nearly 50% of respondents to the
[SPEAKER_00]: question, what do you think causes acne,
said clemeness of skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people believe if they keep clean
skin, they won't get acne, and sadly,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does not hold true, and we're going
to talk about why that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does cause acne?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the true cause?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, acne is caused by the plugging of
alcohols, which is mostly due to excessive
[SPEAKER_00]: sebum production by sebaceous glands,
stimulated by the influence of androgens,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are male sex hormones, testosterone
being an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the oil well here because we have
the excessive oil production.
[SPEAKER_00]: That skin characterization and plugging of
these follicles speed up the formation of
[SPEAKER_00]: acne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal skin bacteria produces irritating
substance that can cause the inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has also external influences,
such as friction, and also medications can
[SPEAKER_00]: also be causes of acne and cause that to
be worse in some individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: To kind of a quick summary of what acne
actually is, it's the plugging of the
[SPEAKER_00]: follicle to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also excessive sebum production
and the presence and activity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterium, propionibacterium acnes is the
actual bacterium name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, this will lead to
inflammation, and that causes the redness
[SPEAKER_00]: to be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at diet stress and acne,
well, there's a controversial link between
[SPEAKER_00]: diet and acne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it cause it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it influence it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Although many patients believe that their
acne is influenced by certain foods,
[SPEAKER_00]: Western diet may be associated with acne.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's kind of that glycemic index that
can potentially be linked to acne,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not necessarily as much of a
presence as we may think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skim milk may have some of these
androgenic hormones, and that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with acne in teenage girls in
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stress acting among university students
was associated with exam stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a chance that some instances,
there can be these factors that may
[SPEAKER_00]: influence it, but it's not necessarily the
main cause of acne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are androgens in acne the male hormones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, some of these male hormones,
well, entitled male hormones, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: testosterone, are found in both males and
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why they're called male
hormones is they're found in higher
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations in males, and these can
cause the oil glands of the skin to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce more sebum, which is more oil,
and I think that excessive sebum
[SPEAKER_00]: production can lead to that increased
evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's two main forms here that can
occur, two main conditions that can result
[SPEAKER_00]: in acne.
[SPEAKER_00]: One could be a high hormone level.
[SPEAKER_00]: This increased amount of hormone can lead
to overproduction of sebum, which you see
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: High hormone level, excessive oil
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also another condition,
could be high receptor level.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can make cells overly sensitive to
the signal resulting in high production of
[SPEAKER_00]: sebum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a lot of receptors,
even if there's kind of a lower amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: the hormone present, there'll be a lot of
binding sites and that can lead to a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of oil being produced, resulting in
greater incidence of acne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now cause of excessive sebum production
and increase of are androgen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hormonal secretions become higher during
puberty, which causes these sebaceous
[SPEAKER_00]: glands to become larger and simply produce
more sebum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, it's that key sebum production
that is causing the main cause of that
[SPEAKER_00]: acne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it does occur in both males and
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Women can have the menstrual cycle or
being pregnant, starting or ending,
[SPEAKER_00]: can take contraceptive pills, which can
cause hormonal changes, can influence them
[SPEAKER_00]: even further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, medication can cause that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain hormone level changes can also
influence the sebum production,
[SPEAKER_00]: which then will result in acne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heredity and I guess the drugs can also
potentially influence this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the variations of acne,
we have a very light condition here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, characterized by whiteheads,
blackheads, for example, very hard to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moderate, which is inflammatory,
increases and becomes more serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the severe case.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here, can also result in scarring in
the most severe cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at some facts and causes about
acne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people think if they eat chocolate
and greasy foods, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: the nice chocolate bar or the French
fries, will that cause acne to occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's no scientific proof there's
a correlation between that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will dirty skin cause acne?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, acne is caused by executive
production of sebum from the skin,
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can stress cause increased acne?
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting ready for an exam or big test.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is potentially some relationship
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, recent studies do show these
corticosteroids, which are increased
[SPEAKER_00]: during times of stress, may stimulate
sebum production and hence worsen acne.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may not be a direct or always a
direct cause, but these corticosteroids if
[SPEAKER_00]: they increase that sebum production,
that is what then will result in acne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Facts about treatment of acne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I get acne despite washing my face
several times a day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, too much washing can actually
irritate the skin further and worsen your
[SPEAKER_00]: acne.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gently washing your face daily with a
mild cleanser or soap and patting it dry
[SPEAKER_00]: can help reduce acne, but excessive
washing is actually a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people believe they just let acne run
its course, it'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you have those severe cases,
it could cause scarring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I squeeze the acne?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I kind of get rid of it that way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, squeezing can actually cause that
infected material to go deeper into your
[SPEAKER_00]: skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if acne cannot be cured in a month,
then should I try other drugs or
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, typically these are very slow
acting, which is again not what people
[SPEAKER_00]: want to hear, but you typically have to
wait over a month to see if there's actual
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you try something next
week or the week after didn't work,
[SPEAKER_00]: it may take longer for that to actually
activate and see results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the purpose of these acne
treatments, to decrease sebum production.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the key part here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We reduce the bacterium, reduce the
carotidization, and eliminate
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dermatologists would be the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can combine two or more treatments to
create an effective therapy to prevent new
[SPEAKER_00]: lesions from forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why have the one plus one equals kind
of three here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in certain cases, you could try two
separate treatments and you could get a
[SPEAKER_00]: very positive effect, more than just each
one individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of just relates to the
purpose of acne treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each individual is unique and
dermatologists can have more tools at
[SPEAKER_00]: their disposal, have seen more cases,
and as a result can suggest the best mode
[SPEAKER_00]: of treatment for you in your individual
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, if they prescribe something to
you, you may have to wait over a month for
[SPEAKER_00]: it to work, which may not be what you want
to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully the goal is that long term
reduction in sebum production to
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately reduce your acne.
Thank you.
