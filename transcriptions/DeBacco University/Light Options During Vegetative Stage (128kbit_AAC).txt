[SPEAKER_00]: Okay here we're looking at a nice lineup
of lighting options that we can use during
[SPEAKER_00]: the vegetative growth phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with a nice picture here,
there's no one set light for vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation or really any stage of the
growth per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many options can still be successful and
the vegetative state probably offers the
[SPEAKER_00]: most opportunities for different types of
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key though in the vegetative state is
the duration of lighting that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using, how long or what's the photo period
the plants are being exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, lights can cover slightly more
area during the vegetative phase than the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind that if you're
looking at the square footage of lights
[SPEAKER_00]: covered in the vegetative and look at
transferring that over to the flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it covers slightly more area at the
vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluorescent lights, while these may be
beneficial for propagation, overall the
[SPEAKER_00]: PAR readings of these are not able to meet
the demands of a growing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since these lights must be kept very close
to the leaves, it can limit the coverage
[SPEAKER_00]: area and also the penetration of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was great for propagation or early
on and you can see some other lights here
[SPEAKER_00]: in the background for more the true
growing phase is when the plants get
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS or high pressure sodiums are commonly
used throughout the flowering phase of
[SPEAKER_00]: light but can also be used as a vegetative
light as we see the plants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If used as a vegetative phase,
keep an eye on the distance your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are from the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to try to keep it around at
least that two feet distance to ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum power to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help reduce the tendency of
stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people put them very far away
because of the natural spectrum,
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS is produced, it can induce a little
bit more stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you keep them a little bit closer or
right kind of at that minimum distance,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can help reduce the chance that
they'll stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, I suggest you put them on
those ratchet hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I strongly advise to allow you to keep
kind of changing the distance that the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights are from the ceiling, maintaining
that two feet from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: CMHs are ceramic metal halides,
great choice for the veg phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 215 here and this is a double
ended bulb here, so 600 watts just in this
[SPEAKER_00]: one light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's close to the spectrum of natural
sunlight and this also produces UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very efficient par to watt ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are both very efficient lights in
this category.
[SPEAKER_00]: They run cooler compared to other HID
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bulb has a relatively long lifespan,
about 20,000 hours and still producing 80%
[SPEAKER_00]: of its original out of the box rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should purchase everything though as a
unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it costs a little bit more because
these can have very specific requirements,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bulbs may not get along with different
ballasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of companies now are selling them
all as one unit and that would be advised
[SPEAKER_00]: to purchase everything together so you're
ensuring that everything works with one
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEPs are light emitting plasmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: While they do produce a quality spectrum,
due to the cost of these in the
[SPEAKER_00]: competition of CMHs entering the market,
there's slight advantages but overall it's
[SPEAKER_00]: overshadowed by the overall cost of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, most growers are shifting
over to the use of more CMHs and phasing
[SPEAKER_00]: out LEPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, LED is a great option for all
phases of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: All LED lights though are not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's currently great variance within
this category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality LED lights that have all the
benefits are often cost prohibitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the better ones tend to be more
expensive and the cheaper ones tend not to
[SPEAKER_00]: be quite as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be considered as an option but
compared currently to CMHs for grow
[SPEAKER_00]: operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They offer many of the same benefits but
they can be at reduced cost to run,
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced heat, but that upfront cost may
make them out of reach for some growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
