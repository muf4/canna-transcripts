[SPEAKER_00]: You may associate ascorbic acid with
vitamin C being in oranges and other
[SPEAKER_00]: citrus crops and you are correct,
but here we'll look at its impact as a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant hormone and what effects that can
have on plants more than just the citrus
[SPEAKER_00]: such as the oranges and lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this vitamin C is an abundant component
of plants and it's proposed functions in
[SPEAKER_00]: pro-synthesis as an enzyme cofactor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also includes the synthesis of
ethylene gibberellins and anthocyanins and
[SPEAKER_00]: also in the control of cell growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can have more than just the
post-synthetic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also control and regulate
potentially cell growth in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: L-absorbic acid is just referring as L
referring to the type of shape that it
[SPEAKER_00]: has.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at L and D forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: L is more biologically active.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the form of vitamin C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's essential for plants as it is to
animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that crosses both plants
and animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vitamin C here regulates cell division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vitamin C can see here growth and it's
involved in signal transduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the passing of signals within a plant
or within a cell in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to the single pathway
responsible for absorbic acid by synthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: in animals, in contrast to that,
plants use multiple pathways to synthesize
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular plant hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This perhaps reflects the importance of
this molecule on plant health because it
[SPEAKER_00]: has multiple pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: In case something was to happen to one,
plants almost need a way to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: produce this particular plant hormone,
absorbic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, they have multiple pathways
to be able to accomplish that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sourcing acids, not only important in
antioxidant, also appears to link to
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering time, developmental senescence,
which is the degradation of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves here, for example, they senesce,
they die off like the leaves in a new
[SPEAKER_00]: England fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Program cell death, which is apoptosis,
and responds to pathogens through complex
[SPEAKER_00]: signal transduction network.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I try to show a little bit here is
this complex network.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an example of how you can
have one input cutting a whole cascade of
[SPEAKER_00]: events to occur, ultimately leading to
gene regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just some of the examples of
what absorbic acid can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, therefore it's assumed that
absorbic acid affects phytochrome mediated
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling, which is processed during the
transition from the vegetative to the
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductive phase in the final stages of
development and ultimately senescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're flipping your plants,
going from a vegetative to that flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: stage, during that flower development,
absorbic acid could be occurring in higher
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts and influencing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just an example how a plant
hormone, while may be needed in small
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts in the plant, can have large
effects on that whole plant's physiology
[SPEAKER_00]: and potentially even the anatomy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
