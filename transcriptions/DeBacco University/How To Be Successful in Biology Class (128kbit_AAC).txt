[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over an
introduction to biology and how to be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful so you're not feeling like this
cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, looking at biology, I don't want you
simply to memorize.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a textbook is for as a
reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want you to be able to do is to
look at something and determine,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, this is a normal, quote, healthy
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we work with that information that
we may gain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at this leaf, we can see what
makes it different.
[SPEAKER_00]: People might say it's brown, but noticing
the brown is kind of located in a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: region, so being a little bit more
specific and looking at seeing what that
[SPEAKER_00]: tells us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This all goes back to being able to
problem solve, being able to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: situation and figure it out even if it
takes a couple tries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while there's many educational
resources available, hoping that you
[SPEAKER_00]: choose wisely and found this channel and
continue to look at some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: videos here on Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what makes Tobacco University so
great is anytime, anywhere you can access
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breakfast, dinner, snack time,
night time, day time, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's accessible for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're watching some of the
content, you always want to ask yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: how can I apply what I have learned?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can teach how all the pieces of chess
move, but how do they interact and how can
[SPEAKER_00]: you put a game together?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what this is looking forward to
producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, this is less of a concern of
the actual process that you go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to watch videos once or twice or
look at subtitles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more concerned with the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of grades the ability to problem
solve and to work with the information,
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily how you go about learning
the information, at least initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: This working with the information is great
for long-term memory retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of the intention and goal
here is to be able to not just remember it
[SPEAKER_00]: for the test, but remember it for the
longer term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the topics that we're going to be
going over in biology are kind of broken
[SPEAKER_00]: apart by quarter here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have everything from biology
fundamentals to kind of cells in DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get into kind of a progression
of evolution, plants and animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, we end with body systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you have a lot of learning to
come in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
