[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at an
overview of the endocrine system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the image located here on
the title slide, you can see a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: areas, glands that are very important to
the endocrine system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at secretion of hormones in
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in the upper area, particularly in
and surrounding the brain, thyroid,
[SPEAKER_00]: the thalamus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we work our way down near the pancreas
and adrenal glands, which are located on
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the kidneys, and ultimately the
ovaries and the testes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the endocrine system, what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do these glands consist of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's glands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do these glands do?
[SPEAKER_00]: These glands release hormones and they go
directly into the bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, hormones are chemicals that are
released as one part of the body and
[SPEAKER_00]: travel through the bloodstream and affect
activities of cells in other parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at that connection
between the hormones being produced in
[SPEAKER_00]: small quantities in one section,
one particular gland, and then it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: through the entire body causing an effect
that could be from cells that are very
[SPEAKER_00]: distantly located from the original site
where those hormones are produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what does this kind of look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these releasing of hormones,
which are chemical messengers,
[SPEAKER_00]: into the bloodstream signal cells,
and these are signaling target cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they behave in certain ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we say a target cell, we need that
hormone to be able to bind to a receptor
[SPEAKER_00]: to then cause a secondary messenger or
cause a reaction to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This binding stage is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because these hormones are
produced in very small quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They circulate through the entire body,
and only where they bind will they cause
[SPEAKER_00]: that response to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a slow but widespread form of
communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not very, you know, super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's circling throughout the body,
but it's providing this communication of
[SPEAKER_00]: this hormone from one cell to a distant
cell in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the reason why I say it's kind of a
slow connection or a slow kind of way of
[SPEAKER_00]: regulating is we have a very fast system
called our nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people are comparing endocrine
and nervous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people get these confused,
but they're vastly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nervous system transmits electrical
signals and releases neurotransmitters to
[SPEAKER_00]: target tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are very fast but short-lasting
responses for our nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endocrine system, which is our focus
here, are ductless glands, and they
[SPEAKER_00]: secrete chemical signals directly into the
bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, chemicals travel to target tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: These target cells have receptor proteins,
and these results in slow but a
[SPEAKER_00]: long-lasting response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a nervous system is a quick kind
of movement of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endocrine system, that production of
hormones, is causing a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: delay to the response, but it'll be a much
longer lasting response than the nervous
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, comparing nervous and endocrine,
similarities and differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of our similarities are they're
both involved in maintaining homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both secrete chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endocrine system, those transmitters
are hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it's getting the message
across.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nervous system, they're actually
neurotransmitters occurring between
[SPEAKER_00]: neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Differences here, the nervous system
responds much faster than the endocrine
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endocrine system lasts much longer
when compared to the nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nerve impulses are transported by neuron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hormones are transported by the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that we're having this
very quick response.
[SPEAKER_00]: A nervous system of about 200,
over 250 miles per hour, and endocrine is
[SPEAKER_00]: relying on hormones, which are chemical
messengers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, regulation of those chemical
messengers, neurotransmitters,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, released by the neurons,
important for the nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hormones are released by the endocrine
glands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see just a couple listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very different than our
neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very short communication here between
neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what does this endocrine signaling
look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a secreting cell, our endocrine
gland, sending our kind of hormone
[SPEAKER_00]: message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's bypassing this cell,
because this is a non-target cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the wrong receptor, the wrong
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: This blue cell does have the proper shape,
and that will receive the signal and cause
[SPEAKER_00]: a response to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why hormones and binding is very
important, because they're very specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, messenger molecules, cells must
communicate with one another to coordinate
[SPEAKER_00]: cell processes within tissues and maintain
homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about that a little bit later,
but we need this cell-to-cell
[SPEAKER_00]: communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is carried out via messenger
molecules, and they bind to different
[SPEAKER_00]: surface proteins, and that's what's going
to cause a response to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do need to understand and look at
all the very specifics here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I want you to get the generalness
that we're having this binding occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: with these surface proteins, causing a
response to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, gene regulation within the
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this regulation, where are hormones
needed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're the communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the actual chemical messengers
that's occurring in one part of the body
[SPEAKER_00]: and traveling to another part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here, for example, growth hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're affecting muscles, the liver,
and bone growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing this one hormone causing a
response to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: More of a daily routine, they have
regulation on large scale, such as
[SPEAKER_00]: regulating blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blood glucose levels, blood calcium
levels, the salt in your body,
[SPEAKER_00]: also related to metabolism growth,
development, maturation, and reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these involve hormones and these
feedback systems that are occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, endocrine hormones are produced by
ductless glands and feed into the
[SPEAKER_00]: bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may affect a wide array of target
cells to produce multiple effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Major glands that make up the endocrine
system are the hypothalamus, pituitary
[SPEAKER_00]: gland, the thyroid, parathyroids,
adrenals, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a whole list here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to make you memorize all the
individual hormones, but realize each
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone is produced in a very specific
gland, which is located in a very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two major types of hormones,
peptides, which are small proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: and steroids, which are lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So important to note, there's differences
between those two and how they react.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other hormones, just to close here,
erythropriotin is secreted by the kidneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stimulates bone marrow to produce red
blood cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many other organs, as we just saw there,
besides endocrine glands, also produce
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kidneys produce several hormones that
regulate blood pressure, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: essential for kidney function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, they're helping maintain that
blood pressure and they can do that
[SPEAKER_00]: through hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The digestive system also produces several
hormones that regulate appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see how there's a lot of
complexities going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important that all these operate
and function properly so the body can
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
