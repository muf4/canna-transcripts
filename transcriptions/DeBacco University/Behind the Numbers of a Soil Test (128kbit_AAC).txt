[SPEAKER_00]: Okay Cameron, take a brief look behind the
numbers of a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get these numbers back, print it
out, and report after we send it to our
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What those kind of numbers mean,
and how does the lab go about getting some
[SPEAKER_00]: of those?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the objective of a soil test is to
estimate the amount of plant available
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind this is different,
and this is not the total amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, soil test labs use an
extraction fluid to simulate the plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to remove nutrients from the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal is we want to get the ones
that the plant can easily access.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're tied up and locked up,
we don't assess those in the soil report.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'd be a different test if you want
the total amount of potassium in your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, because that would assess the amount
that's locked up, as we would call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the ones that are easy to get by
the plant, and as a result, extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: fluids are what's used to try to estimate
what a plant can pull out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular soil sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this extraction fluid, well there's
different extraction fluids, and this can
[SPEAKER_00]: result in a different estimate of soil
nutrient supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: The appropriate soil test method for a
given region are selected based on soil
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics and climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as for example, the extraction
fluid is going to try to ring out the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we're in a soil here where we're
very sandy environment, maybe using a
[SPEAKER_00]: different extraction fluid than one that's
here with higher organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, they're going to be based on the
region, so typically if you're testing
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, you want to look at what a local lab
is using for extraction fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they can be differences in
extraction fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two main extraction fluids used
in New England.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most commonly weak acid, modified
Morgan extract, and the strong Malik 3
[SPEAKER_00]: extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the University of New Hampshire uses
the Malik 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are both the universal extraction
procedures, meaning that they used to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine the amount of majority of the
nutrients and many micronutrients at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though they are different
extraction fluids, and once more
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive, they both can give you kind of
the same idea of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then keeping in mind, if you're comparing
a modified Morgan extract versus a Malik
[SPEAKER_00]: 3, some nutrients may differ.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just because of the extraction
fluid that is used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
