[SPEAKER_00]: Ever wanted to learn more about the
vegetative or grown nutrients you see at
[SPEAKER_00]: grow shops?
[SPEAKER_00]: At this Tobacco University video,
we'll provide some information just on
[SPEAKER_00]: that topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see some wonderful plants here in the
vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, vegetative or grown nutrients for
cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we utilize those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, veg or grown nutrients, just in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are intended to be used during the
vegetative stage, again, as the name
[SPEAKER_00]: implies, for plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can also really be used at any
stage of plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they tend to have higher levels
of nitrogen to support plant biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, such as the leaves and the stems,
and lower levels of phosphorus and
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium that are needed in greater
amounts during the flowering and later
[SPEAKER_00]: stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that does not mean once you flip
your plants into flowering stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd simply stop using these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can continue to utilize them because
they still can be effective even later in
[SPEAKER_00]: stages of growth, if used properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, how long should I veg for best yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this may depend on the strain you're
growing and the size of your growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in general, most growers are kind
of vegging for four to six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, plants will stretch at least
50% after the flip, within that transition
[SPEAKER_00]: from the vegetative stage to the flowering
stage photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, plan accordingly for your growth
space, particularly if you're ceiling
[SPEAKER_00]: height.
[SPEAKER_00]: For outdoor growers, plants will start
flowering in early July, if you're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: For growing, if you're growing an out of
flower, remember your plant will flower
[SPEAKER_00]: based on days old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that may influence when you fertilize
it and what you fertilize it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, veg nutrients can be used any time,
and this is something a lot of growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think, realize, that many times
growers will reduce the frequency or
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of vegagrow fertilizers
right after flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically, these fertilizers can serve
as a great base of feeding program for the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some veg grow fertilizers do contain
levels of phosphorus and potassium anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, depending on the ratio the plant
needs, many times these fertilizers are a
[SPEAKER_00]: staple in the growing operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, don't think just because it says veg
and your plants are in flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be some sort of negative
interaction there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These veg nutrients tend to be a more
stable blend, do offer some nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have to adjust the amounts and
concentration and amount of times you use
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, they can be utilized at the
early stages of growth, as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phase as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can help you produce a very quality
yield.
