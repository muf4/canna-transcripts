[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're involved with cannabis
production, you may want to be considering
[SPEAKER_00]: some form of odor control depending who
your neighbors are, who's in your
[SPEAKER_00]: vicinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, DeBaco University here will
provide you some ideas and suggestions for
[SPEAKER_00]: odor control.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, if you're looking for ways to
reduce the odor of your cannabis plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've come to the right place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, keep in mind that filters
make a good addition in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether we're looking at removing odors or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to kind of have those in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But utilizing intake filters in particular
can help control air that's being brought
[SPEAKER_00]: into the grow area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can involve removal of insects and
also particles from the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these will not impact the odor around
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're specifically going to be
targeting the smell generated by the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we've grown cannabis plants,
there is that distinctive odor that they
[SPEAKER_00]: do produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early on, plants will have a minimal
amount of odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might think, oh, we're getting by
just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in the three to five weeks old,
odor will start to become apparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And odor will start in the vegetative
stage, but will really come much more
[SPEAKER_00]: apparent during the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if odor is an issue early, keep in mind
that it'll become a much bigger issue
[SPEAKER_00]: later in the growing cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to plan for that ahead of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're smelling when the plants are
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only going to get, quote,
worse or more prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be considering an odor
control option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you want to consider your neighbors,
meaning while odor control has a little
[SPEAKER_00]: impact on the actual plant's productivity,
it can be the difference between growing
[SPEAKER_00]: or not growing your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, depending on who your neighbors
are, or particularly where you're located.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard to do it in an outdoor situation,
but for indoor situations, we have greater
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go over some of those options for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So odor control and ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're having some form of
ventilation regardless, but the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: area, because that typically is required
by the growing area, so when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: odor control, this often requires some
simple modifications or additions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're moving air through and
ventilating your area like you should
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway, adding one of these odor control
options should be fairly easy once you've
[SPEAKER_00]: gone through the initial investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to consider the different
options you have available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not just one option.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to evaluate the options,
and you should take into account the size
[SPEAKER_00]: of the area and the operation and the
degree of odor control you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just looking at reducing a little
bit, or are you looking at really making
[SPEAKER_00]: it non-existent?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to present some options here,
give you the advantages and disadvantages
[SPEAKER_00]: of all the options presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to search Tobacco
University here for more detail on each of
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with the first one here,
looking at carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages is that it allows for high
airflow volumes, very easy to install,
[SPEAKER_00]: and comes in a variety of sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantage with carbon
filters is they cannot be used in highly
[SPEAKER_00]: humid conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to start getting above 75
plus percent humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their effectiveness really decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also do not need to be changed out
after a period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that you do need to change
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just can't put them in there and like,
oh, they're all set.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all my carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you notice after a couple of grow
cycles, it may not be working as
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively because they do need to be
changed over a period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just set it and forget it forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will need to be replaced at a certain
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also ozone generators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the advantage is no chemicals or
residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy to use and operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages is they cannot
be used in high traffic areas where people
[SPEAKER_00]: will be present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And regulation ozone limits may limit
their effectiveness, meaning the degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: ozone that's needed for odor control kind
of may conflict with certain limits set by
[SPEAKER_00]: certain governing agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprays and absorbing gels as our last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage is they're very easy to add
to a ventilation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is they do not eliminate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really only mask the odors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike some of the others that we have
talked about previously, they will kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of, these ones just kind of mask the
odors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also need frequent replacement and
need to be purchased in a timely manner to
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're planned to be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if any of these sounded of interest to
you, welcome to search the channel to get
[SPEAKER_00]: some more details.
