[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have heard the term gene
therapy in the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here we're going to learn a little
bit about that process and how it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what is gene therapy in
general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, gene therapy introduces healthy
genes into cells that lack them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was first used successfully in the
year 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two girls were cured of a rare blood
disorder caused by a defective gene and
[SPEAKER_00]: the girls remained healthy, even well
beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this is in the most basic form is
kind of repairing genes or fixing a broken
[SPEAKER_00]: gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's identifying a region or a gene that
is defective, identifying that area and
[SPEAKER_00]: replacing it with a healthy gene and
allowing that cell then to replicate,
[SPEAKER_00]: causing that now normal or healthy gene to
proliferate in the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this has other cases and
implications.
[SPEAKER_00]: One example would be cloning of animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's just an example of Dolly the
sheep.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is Dolly the sheep clone produced?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's through this kind of concept of
gene therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the successful embryos, about 30 in
277 tries, so again, not a great
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage, were transplanted into a
surrogate mother sheep.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did this process look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though only one in 270 tries was
successful, in July 5th, 1996,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dolly was born.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did that process go about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you take that donor cell from a
sheep and we extract or extract the
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleus as extract it from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, only the nucleus is being
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this egg cell taken from an adult
female sheep and that nucleus of the egg
[SPEAKER_00]: cell is removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially from this sheep,
we have the egg cell components in
[SPEAKER_00]: machinery and from this sheep,
we only have the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through an electrical shock process,
that nucleus is transferred into that
[SPEAKER_00]: fused egg cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That egg cell then is induced to divide
normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That single fused egg cell will then
produce an embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That embryo will be placed into a foster
mother and that foster mother will
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately have the cloned sheep as a
offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the embryo develops normally and that
baby lamb is produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it was Dolly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since Dolly scientists have
successfully cloned sheep, mice,
[SPEAKER_00]: cattle, goats, and pigs, however,
problems and complications still arise
[SPEAKER_00]: leading to premature death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really sure why that's the case,
but Dolly died in 2002 having lived only
[SPEAKER_00]: half a normal sheep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while the process does make sense that
we're just taking the nucleus from one and
[SPEAKER_00]: the egg cell from another, there's still a
potential for shortened life expectancies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Yukon has gone through with large
animals and in 1999, the birth of the
[SPEAKER_00]: first cloned calf from an adult farm
animal in non-reproductive cells in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its name was Amy and Amy has given birth
to a 103 pound calf in 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you look here, this is kind of the
mother, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see that they also have a very
similar kind of white triangle on the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of their head there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were all the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I forget all their names, but it was
A, B, C, D, and E.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had the name that came later,
A, B, C, D, and E.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was Yukon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stem cell basics, how is all this
possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's through the process of stem
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stem cells have a very unique
characteristic to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're what we call pluripotent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means they're capable of forming
an entire organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: One cell can form basically all the
components of an organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: As development proceeds, cells lose their
pluripotent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they become committed to one type of
tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are called adult stem cells
because they still have the genetics to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce anything, but they themselves kind
of become specialized and only produce one
[SPEAKER_00]: particular type of cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since you arise from just one cell that
had to have the ability to perform and
[SPEAKER_00]: produce all these different tissue types.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, as you get older, heart muscle
cells tend to produce more heart muscle
[SPEAKER_00]: cells and neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the short, at least first two years,
they can produce more neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intestinal cells produce more intestinal
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: They become more specialized.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start to lose that pluripotentness
that that originally had when we're very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very young.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at stem cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some benefits and some drawbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So benefits, embryonic stem cells could be
used to restore tissues lost or damaged
[SPEAKER_00]: due to accident or disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experiments have already been tried and
successful in mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damaged spinal nerves, as I mentioned,
nerve cells don't divide for very long
[SPEAKER_00]: into your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So damaged spinal nerves can be partially
repaired, can help someone recover from a
[SPEAKER_00]: spinal cord injury, might be paralyzed in
parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's some of the benefits to stem
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the problems though is finding a
source, especially for those embryonic
[SPEAKER_00]: stem cells, harvesting them from discarded
embryos rises.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethical issues are you're killing unborn
babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also the possibility of
an immune system rejecting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So implanted stem cells will likely be
rejected by the immune system of the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to realize some of the
benefits, but also be mindful of some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the issues or problems when you're making
a decision going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things that science has to do is
constantly balances the pros with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for joining us.
