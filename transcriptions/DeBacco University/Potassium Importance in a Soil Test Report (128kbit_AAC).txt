[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
we're going to be looking at potassium as
[SPEAKER_00]: related to soil test report and why it's
important to watch and monitor your
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potassium, typically called potash,
is important when we're looking at your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil test report.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when I say soil test report,
we're typically not testing these little
[SPEAKER_00]: homeowner kits here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting it tested at a professional
lab and basing our results off that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant potassium requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at our plants,
do we require large amounts of potassium?
[SPEAKER_00]: And elemental symbol K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium is released from rocks and soil
minerals as they weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often the supply of potassium from the
soil is limited and inputs of this
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient are required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply because there might be potassium
present, but typically not at the levels
[SPEAKER_00]: that are required by plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the potassium functions within
that plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it so important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, potassium is critical for numerous
plant functions and especially aids in
[SPEAKER_00]: hardiness and potential for disease
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we can see for increased root
growth, we see potassium building and
[SPEAKER_00]: strengthening the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water status for growing fruits,
it can be in that actual fleshy component
[SPEAKER_00]: of the fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of functions for
potassium in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's typically needed in large
amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're adding potassium
fertilizer, we want to look at the timing
[SPEAKER_00]: of that potassium fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically plants need potassium more in
the second half of the growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers should add fertilizer to best
match this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all the fertilizer is provided at the
time of planting, this can increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: odds of deficiencies later in the growing
season and also increase the chance that
[SPEAKER_00]: the potassium added will be leached and
kind of wasted and potentially become a
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminant to the local environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at that kind of days
after planting and that kind of when's
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium going to be needed we're going
to be looking at that later portion here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That potassium uptake would be needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we fertilize everything here in the
first 30 days, well, the total amount
[SPEAKER_00]: needed, not really that much, much later
in the season needed in greater amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, good time to fertilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example here, looking at the graph
would be about that 30 to 40 days or so,
[SPEAKER_00]: assuming there's some levels in the soil
and to allow for that really high demand
[SPEAKER_00]: phase to be when the potassium is most
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we spot a potassium deficiency
potentially?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to look like this in many
crops, but potassium can move within the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So deficiencies are likely to show in the
older leaves first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's typically expresses itself as a
yelling of the leaf margins or edges of
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can clearly see that here and also to a
less extent, but still prevalent here on
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf margins here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how you would spot potassium
deficiency, but hopefully you catch it
[SPEAKER_00]: early enough where if you don't get into
this situation, but if you are starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: see this, you might want to check your
potassium levels because likely they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be deficient in that nutrient.
