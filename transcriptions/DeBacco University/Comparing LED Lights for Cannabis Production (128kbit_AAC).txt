[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're searching for LED lights to
potentially add to your growing area,
[SPEAKER_00]: here at Tobacco University, I want to
compare some common LED lighting options
[SPEAKER_00]: in relation to cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into comparing LED lights for
cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the disclaimer, I have not
received any financial compensation for
[SPEAKER_00]: writing the following product review.
[SPEAKER_00]: My opinions are provided, so take them for
what they are worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a standard for comparison,
we'll be looking at the following lights
[SPEAKER_00]: are all full spectrum, which is the LED
lights I feel are the best for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: For each grow light, I'll be providing the
good, the bad and recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first up is the Gavita CT-1930E 780
watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPF of 1930 micromoles per second output
for more crop loving light up to 20%
[SPEAKER_00]: energy savings versus 1000 watt dumbbell
ended HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fits the traditional HPS layout.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very efficient with the efficacy of
2.5 moles per second per watt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bad is that it is expensive and it's
limited light distribution because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: all these are in a relatively small area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's best utilized when lighting a large
area is not the main goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now advantages again is that it doesn't
have any fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have cooling fins above it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another light here by Gavita.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is their 1700E Generation II 645 watt
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does produce 1700 micromoles per
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fixture results in impressive efficiency
of 2.6 micromoles per second per watt.
[SPEAKER_00]: This causes a reduced in HVAC cost of 30
to 40% when compared to your traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: metal headlight or high pressure sodium
grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: IP 660 wet rating and is UL 8800 compliant
for use in wet environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bad is its wide design may restrict
its mounting options.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's best used when trying to evenly light
a large area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to keep that large relative
structure level as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one here to mention against just
a very brief overview would be the Fluence
[SPEAKER_00]: Viper 2X and 2P.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are full spectrum that have been
researched specifically for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall is of course the cost is
somewhat higher in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall it offers the best of both worlds
and there is high power option for those
[SPEAKER_00]: who will be using the light in a carbon
dioxide enriched environment but really I
[SPEAKER_00]: would favor the full spectrum in this
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I was only to pick one of these I
tend to favor the Fluence and I actually
[SPEAKER_00]: have the plants here in the picture under
Fluence light the Viper 2X.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that the 3X is not a full spectrum so
I prefer the 2X for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This seems to fit most growing situations
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Offers growers a grower friendly options.
[SPEAKER_00]: However Gavita is becoming a seriously
competitor recently so it is a worthy
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again the LED market is constantly
changing so you want to use these only as
[SPEAKER_00]: a source of general comparison then make
the best decision for what light is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to fit your particular growing conditions.
