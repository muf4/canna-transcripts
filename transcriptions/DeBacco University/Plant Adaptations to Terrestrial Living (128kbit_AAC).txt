[SPEAKER_00]: This video lecture is going to look at
plants adaptations to terrestrial living.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did plants make the change from living
in a mainly aquatic environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as the ocean here, to living on land,
which has a lot of challenges associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, adapting to this terrestrial living,
in general, plants are complex
[SPEAKER_00]: multicellular organisms that are
autotrophs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, now, they're primary terrestrial,
dominant organisms on the surface of
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth, and nearly 300,000 species of
plants are known today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this just gives you an example of some
of the diversity within plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adapting to this terrestrial living,
green algae that were probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: ancestors of today's plants are aquatic
organisms that are not well adapted to
[SPEAKER_00]: living on land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before their descendants could live on
land, they had to overcome many
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just making this jump in to the rocks
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see green algae pictured right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions are, how do these plants learn
to absorb minerals?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they conserve water being on land?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do they reproduce on land?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of the major challenges
plants have to face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, comparing that algae to that
plant, the whole algae performs
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis, surrounding water supports
it, and it can hold fast, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, terrestrial-based plants have
leaves, cuticles, stomata, stems,
[SPEAKER_00]: and roots to help support them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to go over these in
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start adapting to the rest of the
environment, plant macro nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the big nutrients that plants
are mostly composed of.
[SPEAKER_00]: They constitute only 1% or more of plants
biomass, which is their dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things you might be familiar
with seeing on fertilizers, such as
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, potassium, calcium, phosphorus,
magnesium, and sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these may not be in exact elemental
form, but they're what plants need so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't get this yellowing region here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a potassium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure your soil is fertile
and has the proper amount of nutrients to
[SPEAKER_00]: support the plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, pH influences nutrient availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here a pH of 7, which is
neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the nutrients overall on land are
most widely available.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we decrease or become more acidic,
we see, in particular, nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium, phosphorus, sulfur,
calcium, all start to really get less
[SPEAKER_00]: plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing if the soil becomes too
alkaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also reduce the availability of
certain nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see iron here being the exception at a
lower pH it's more plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a reminder, it's the measure of the
hydrogen ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see here pH of 0 being extremely
acidic, pH of 7 being neutral,
[SPEAKER_00]: and pH 14 being very basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see where some common solutions you
might be familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coffee, slightly acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blood is just ever so slightly basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Milk and magnesium, ammonia, bleach,
a lot more on the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of your household cleaners are
basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, again, here also gives you just
that general scale of what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pH, remember, mathematically,
is equal to minus the log base 10 of the
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen ion concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a way to think about this is a very
acidic environment has a lot of hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we work our way to becoming more basic,
we notice the hydrogen ion amount
[SPEAKER_00]: decreases and the hydroxide ion increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a proportion because it forms this
nice rectangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: At pH 7 or neutral, the hydrogen ion
concentration would equal the hydroxide
[SPEAKER_00]: ion concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pure water, which is what neutral
would be, is H2O.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see one hydrogen ion and one
hydroxide becomes H2O.
[SPEAKER_00]: HOH is reduced to H2O.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just these little brackets mean
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So different crops have different target
ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to think there's one golden pH
to reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grasses are 6.2 to 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberries are much more acidic,
4.5 to 5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomatoes, like you grow in your garden,
6.0 to 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's different pH ranges for
different crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: What all crops have here is roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these roots are responsible for
absorbing minerals along with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first plants involve this symbiotic
association with fungi called mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a beneficial fungi that helps
absorb nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant is able to more efficiently
absorb nutrients, while the plant gives
[SPEAKER_00]: the mycorrhizae, the fungi, sugars that it
makes from the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's a symbiotic relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both species are benefiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adapting to rest for a living,
one key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living on land is preventing from being
drying out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants have a watertight, waxy,
out-of-cumin kind of cuticle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows water to bead up, highly waxy,
lipid-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water enters the plants only through the
roots, and the cuticle prevents water loss
[SPEAKER_00]: to the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water's coming in the roots,
through the stems here, and going up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going through this is an example of a
leaf, which we're going to learn more
[SPEAKER_00]: about in another video.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this cuticle is this protective layer,
limiting the amount of exposure water can
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporate out.
[SPEAKER_00]: One area that water can leave is called
the stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specialized pores that allow passage of
water through the cuticle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, these are pores, and I say holes
in the leaves, because the plant can
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate them, as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're found in leaves and sometimes
between portions of the cuticle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They allow for the passage of carbon
dioxide into the plant for the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic process, and water vapor
and oxygen can pass out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the plant can regulate whether
it's open or closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's open, water can leave,
but allows necessary components like
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide into the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's only so much the plant
can keep these open before it dries out
[SPEAKER_00]: and could die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somat is a give-and-take process,
you know, letting water out.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the plant can only let so much
water out before it wilts and may die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see here's the example of the
stomata in a cross-section microscopic
[SPEAKER_00]: view of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that very thick cuticle here on
top, and also in the bottom, only allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: water loss through the stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other challenges that plants
face going through the terrestrial
[SPEAKER_00]: environment is reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: As plants could not move, it was necessary
for plants to pass gametes from one
[SPEAKER_00]: individual to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early plants needed a film of water for
sperm to swim to the egg, and fertilize
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later, pollen was developed, allowing the
transfer of gametes without drying out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very early plants, as we see in mosses,
very low to the ground, need that film of
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, plants have developed ways to use
potentially air.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also use pollinators to help
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some of the ways plants
developed and dealt with some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges going from the aquatic
environment, where the algae or common
[SPEAKER_00]: ancestor may have originated, to the dry
environment of land.
