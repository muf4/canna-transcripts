[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at cell
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether it's a eukaryotic cell we're
talking about or a prokaryotic cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: all cells need and require energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a reminder, eukaryotic cells contain
membrane-downed organelles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prokaryotes do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example of a prokaryote cell would be
like a bacteria, and a eukaryotic cell
[SPEAKER_00]: could be a plant or animal cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, this energy in your cells,
what's it used for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's to maintain temperature,
contract your muscles, complete chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: reactions, allow you to grow and assemble
larger molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all things that your body needs
energy for, and this list could go on from
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with metabolism, all the chemical
reactions in organisms are summarized as
[SPEAKER_00]: the organism's metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: These metabolic activities alter molecules
in a series of steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the digestive process would be an
example of these series of steps that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: through to break down food items.
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy, which is the end result,
is the ability to do work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And enzymes, which are proteins,
accelerate each step of this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And enzymes are able to regulate and
maintain a balanced supply on demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see here we take on starch,
glycogen disaccharides, monosaccharides,
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution of free glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this together is forming the
metabolism, which is a complex set of
[SPEAKER_00]: steps that are allowing the body to
generate this energy by breaking down food
[SPEAKER_00]: items.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where does the energy come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: All organisms must produce energy from the
environment, store it for future use,
[SPEAKER_00]: and use it in a controlled manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just can't consume energy and just
break it all down and just produce all
[SPEAKER_00]: ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also some heat that's generated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some wastes that are generated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this must be done in a controlled
manner to maximize the amount of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does all this energy come from that
we eat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether we're eating meat products,
we're eating grains, we're eating fruits,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're eating vegetables, everything starts
from the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun then produces the light energy
that allows autotrophs to go through the
[SPEAKER_00]: process of synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That then allows us to produce food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, we're using that food,
the chemical energy in the food,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're storing it as ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stands for adenosine triphosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have a separate lecture on
that particular molecule, but this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically the energy currents,
the body's energy currency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a way to think about it, and that's
what the body's going to use to allow
[SPEAKER_00]: these chemical reactions, this chemical
energy to be stored and to be used for
[SPEAKER_00]: future use in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So energy from fuels digest large
molecules into smaller ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: What occurs here, we're breaking bonds and
moving electrons from one molecule to
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: As electrons move, they carry energy,
and that energy is stored in another bond
[SPEAKER_00]: and can be released as heat or harvested
again to make that body currency ATP,
[SPEAKER_00]: adenosine triphosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where our energy from our food
is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening here, we're having
breaking of bonds and moving of electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The electrons carrying that energy is
what's being basically stored to be used
[SPEAKER_00]: for later purposes of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a good kind of slide to kind of look
at, which may initially look a little
[SPEAKER_00]: confusing, is this slide here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about oxidation and
reduction reactions, and this is just the
[SPEAKER_00]: very basics of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if something is oxidized, it loses an
electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So molecule one here is losing an
electron, so it's oxidized.
[SPEAKER_00]: An electron with its negative charge is
being transferred here to our atom number
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gaining an electron, therefore
it's reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, electrons have a negative
charge, so if we're gaining an electron,
[SPEAKER_00]: this will be reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of the trick to remember this is
Leo says, think of the line, Leo losing
[SPEAKER_00]: electrons oxidized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxidation says ger, G-E-R, since we're
gaining electrons is reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we know electrons have a negative
charge, if we're gaining electrons,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna be reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to gain an electron, another atom
or molecule here needs to lose an
[SPEAKER_00]: electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be the oxidizing component,
and this would be the reduced atom here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an oxidation and reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's referred to the transfer of
electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may sound a little counterintuitive,
but if you're gaining electrons,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're losing electrons,
you become oxidized, or basically gaining
[SPEAKER_00]: a more positive related charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this kind of helps you just
understand a little bit of what goes on in
[SPEAKER_00]: our cells and our metabolism, so cells can
gain energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
