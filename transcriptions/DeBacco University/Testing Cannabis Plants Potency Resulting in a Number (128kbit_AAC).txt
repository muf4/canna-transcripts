[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
we're going to be looking at when you test
[SPEAKER_00]: a cannabis plant material for potency and
it results in a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the specifics that go
along with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at testing cannabis
plants potency resulting in a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, when we're looking at
providing that exact number.
[SPEAKER_00]: To provide a reliable number, the dried
cannabis flower material needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: ground up, mixed together into a
homogenized sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps to ensure that all of the
individual flower variability is easily
[SPEAKER_00]: averaged in the final tested product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, this results in a consistent
sample and allows for an accurate number
[SPEAKER_00]: to be provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with that homogenized samples,
we see just a representative example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, while this sample is great for
consistency in the analysis, this is often
[SPEAKER_00]: not how people want to or are accustomed
to consuming their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may want to have that original solid
dry flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to deal with some sort of
diced up small subsample.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want the actual original basically
dry flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there can be flower to flower
inconsistencies that do not allow for a
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent number to be given.
[SPEAKER_00]: It technically should be in expected
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have another video on this if you want
to search the channel to look for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at providing that consistent
single number in order to provide accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a homogenized sample to provide a
number for the potency of that exact
[SPEAKER_00]: sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that blended flower, the results in a
number on a homogenized product that most
[SPEAKER_00]: people do not want to purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here also in capsulated form
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be great for other cannabis end
products that number particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates and also like pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is not for a single dry flower,
which typically brings the highest price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're getting a consistent
purchasing an exact flower with an exact
[SPEAKER_00]: number, realize that the really expected
might be a slight range from that number
[SPEAKER_00]: because as you know, individual flowers
will have slight individual variabilities
[SPEAKER_00]: and uniqueness to each flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's hard to have an exact
number that correlates even though we do
[SPEAKER_00]: see it with dry flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really needs to be performed to be an
accurate result on a homogenized sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
