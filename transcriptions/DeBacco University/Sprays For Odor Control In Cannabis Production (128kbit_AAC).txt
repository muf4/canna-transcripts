[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco University video if you're looking
at using sprays to control odors with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants This will help you ensure
you're using it in the most effective way
[SPEAKER_00]: possible All right, let's get into sprays
for odor control in cannabis production So
[SPEAKER_00]: first off keep in mind that no matter what
spray or what product they're really not
[SPEAKER_00]: good standalone Absorbing gels and sprays
will only do so much to reduce odor
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these items mask the odor more
than eliminate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's important point to keep in mind
Installing an adequate ventilation system
[SPEAKER_00]: with a carbon filter is usually the
preferred option Sprays and gels should
[SPEAKER_00]: only be used in addition to other methods
of odor control and should really not be
[SPEAKER_00]: relied upon as the sole source of odor
control Especially as plants get later in
[SPEAKER_00]: their growth stages, particularly the
flowering stage Now you also want to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants a safe distance away from any
sprays that you might be applying because
[SPEAKER_00]: when using odor absorption Absorbing gels
or sprays make sure plants are a safe
[SPEAKER_00]: distance away to not only reduce the
chance of physical damage But to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the risk of unwanted scent Absorption that
can negatively impact the taste or smell
[SPEAKER_00]: of the buds that you're looking at
producing on your cannabis plant Also
[SPEAKER_00]: where you are you going to place these
sprays or gels is important We want to
[SPEAKER_00]: look when using absorbing gels.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be placed in your ventilation
ducting So if you don't have a ventilation
[SPEAKER_00]: system in place Use of sprays as a quick
kind of way to help control odors is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely not going to be nearly as
effective This is where the odors are
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated within the ducting and the
risk of the plants is minimized So it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really helping maximize the effectiveness
of these particular odor absorbing gels
[SPEAKER_00]: and also sprays because you know that odor
is going to be carried through that
[SPEAKER_00]: ducting by concentrating the gels and
sprays in that area that will help ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: the greatest amount of contact with the
odors you're trying to reduce while
[SPEAKER_00]: Minimizing any potential risk to your
plants which will help again get you the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect that you want by minimizing any
sort of damage that might occur
