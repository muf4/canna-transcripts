[SPEAKER_00]: In this Debaco University video,
we're going to look a little bit at the
[SPEAKER_00]: product called Summit CBD derived from
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look into Summit CBD product here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a product produced by CT
Pharma, and what's great is that they
[SPEAKER_00]: provide analytical reports and labels for
the products they produce online.
[SPEAKER_00]: The descriptions, options, and uses are
intended to provide an understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the end products of the cannabis
plant, and here we're going to be looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Summit CBD, which is one of their
higher CBD content products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the general description?
[SPEAKER_00]: While CBD is legally available in the U
.S., many of the CBD products you will
[SPEAKER_00]: find do not undergo rigorous testing that
CT Pharma's Summit CBD line offers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's great about the testing that they
have, they also provide it publicly
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CBD flower looks very similar to their
premium flower, however, tested with
[SPEAKER_00]: little to no active THC is intended to
have high CBD levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Summit CBD line offers consumers
access to the medical benefits of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: without the psychoactive feeling,
and it can be a great thing that many are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the options at Summit
CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they offer many things in the line,
everything from flowers, pre-rolls,
[SPEAKER_00]: vapes, tinctures, oil drops, honey,
and towelettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn more about these,
search Debaco University, and we cover
[SPEAKER_00]: these just in general as far as products
goes, so you can just have a better
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of some of these end
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the uses for Summit CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, since it has basically no
psychoactive effects, making it very
[SPEAKER_00]: appealing to the consumer who wants to
feel the relief from their symptoms
[SPEAKER_00]: without being overwhelmed with the
psychoactive aspect of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often used by first-time patients or
patients coming from a non-cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great kind of entry option for
those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for those entry people, as well as for
experienced people, everyone should be
[SPEAKER_00]: asking or making sure that the products
they're using have some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: certificate of analysis with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't come with one,
requesting one and hopefully getting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's on that test?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at microbiology testing,
micro toxins, heavy metal, pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure that they have passed all of
those particular parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, yes, we may be looking at
the, in this case, the CBD profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might be looking at some of the other
things, but making sure it's what's called
[SPEAKER_00]: a clean or certified product is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of times this will be
summarized on the label, as we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: here, or hopefully it's summarized on the
label.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all great things to be looking
for as an educated consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just remembering that not only do you
have the label to look at, but you can
[SPEAKER_00]: also hopefully have a link or access to
the actual original paperwork certifying
[SPEAKER_00]: where the information and numbers came for
that label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as part of you being well educated
and well informed consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
