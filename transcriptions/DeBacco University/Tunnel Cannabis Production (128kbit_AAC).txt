[SPEAKER_00]: And when producing cannabis, there's many
different ways to approach it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one of them that's gaining popularity
in the outdoor world is the use of tunnel
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see a polytunnel, and it's a
way to extend this season here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hamoose is tends to be a little bit longer
season crop, benefiting from a warm,
[SPEAKER_00]: protected environment, and these tunnels
allow this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, there's a comparison,
and I should provide you with a comparison
[SPEAKER_00]: between high tunnel production and
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, greenhouses are permanent structures
that have heat and electricity running to
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally speaking, they tend to be
expensive, but allow for full year
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, and typically cover large areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: High tunnels are basic structures,
have a covering that allows for crop to be
[SPEAKER_00]: protected as it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, they're less expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do extend the season, but do not
allow for full year production,
[SPEAKER_00]: and typically cover 4,000 square feet or
less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now both of these structures, and this is
showing the greenhouse here, the goal is
[SPEAKER_00]: to lengthen the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: This being a greenhouse, can stretch it
basically all year round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the location and natural
growing season, one may be advantageous
[SPEAKER_00]: over the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's an environment to get some
snow, and maybe a greenhouse would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: better choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trying to extend a portion of the
season and don't have quite the upfront
[SPEAKER_00]: capital to go through and provide a full
greenhouse structure, maybe a high tunnel
[SPEAKER_00]: would be a better option.
[SPEAKER_00]: That budget is a consideration,
because greenhouses are much more
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive than high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here the snowy environment with
plants growing on the inside just like it
[SPEAKER_00]: was summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: High tunnels, these are just two examples
here, can be the size of some greenhouses
[SPEAKER_00]: in certain cases, but they differ from
greenhouses, and there's no supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: heat added, and they lack a permanent
floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are planted directly into the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have typically roll-up sides to
increase ventilation for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it going down the whole way
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be moved easily to a new
location, and oftentimes they're put out
[SPEAKER_00]: of rollers to facilitate this process
between two areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caterpillar tunnels are smaller than your
typical hoop house or high tunnel,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they do still offer plant protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not very wide, but they tend to be
very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this seems, again, talking about 15-ish
feet wide, and it can be as long as,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, I think this one's about 96
feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy to set up, takes a full day with two
people the first time, and then it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: done in kind of like one weekend day after
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not very inexpensive option,
and they store very nice and very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be moved, but still offer some
plant protections compared to those
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed just to the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main goal of tunnel production is to
provide limited stress environment to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow maximum yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little stress can be a good thing,
but it's a fine line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So personally, a high-yielding plant's
going to have enough stress on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the grower doesn't need to
intentionally really add any more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people want to say, well,
I want to stress the plants a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if they're growing at high yields,
that's probably enough stress on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply extending that growing season as
possible by protecting the plants from a
[SPEAKER_00]: night or two of cold weather or atypical
temperatures, and that can help,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, just stretch that season even
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
