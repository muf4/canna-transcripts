[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I've pictured here a couple of bloom
nutrient formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: These four are just kind of a random
assortment, but you'll notice that they
[SPEAKER_00]: all say the word bloom on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, what that means is a high
middle number, which stands for the
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, it's nitrogen, phosphorus,
and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is not maybe always the
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at this one, while it does say
bloom, the phosphorus is actually the same
[SPEAKER_00]: amount as the potassium here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, just because it says
bloom, don't assume it's always going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a higher phosphorus number.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to look more specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why you should be reading all of
the nutrient labels there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flowering fertilizers, well,
bloom fertilizers typically contain more
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus to encourage and support
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, growers often excessively add
phosphorus, which can lead to groundwater
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the phosphorus in soils has a very
complex kind of system of components and
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs and losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some can be runoff, but if it is
over-applied, this is where we get into
[SPEAKER_00]: problems where there's usually leaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is usually minor because it should be
minor if you're adding the proper amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you're over-adding,
you can contaminate not only drinking
[SPEAKER_00]: water, but local area freshwater systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an example of that by over-adding
phosphorus can lead to algal blooms in
[SPEAKER_00]: both a small scale, as we see here,
and a large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a satellite image.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be looking as far away as the
Great Lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see algal blooms, particularly
related to excessive phosphorus added to
[SPEAKER_00]: that water system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the path of phosphorus to farms and
growers, well, a lot of it's mined in
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Utah pictured here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some other areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's shipped to the corn belt as
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's applied to corn and soybean fields on
a large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grain containing phosphorus can be
shipped to the corn belt and then to
[SPEAKER_00]: Yukon, and the grain fed then to
livestock, and the manure applied close to
[SPEAKER_00]: the barn areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, the phosphorus that was
originally mined in Florida, yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: went to the corn belt to help grow the
corn, fed to the animals, and then applied
[SPEAKER_00]: as manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means phosphorus from Florida can
accumulate in Yukon soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing could happen to small scale
growers, where it's mined in Florida,
[SPEAKER_00]: shipped as fertilizer, and applied,
sadly, and excessive, can lead to an
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation in a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is this generally an issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we look at the world phosphorus
fertilizer supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the current U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: reserves of phosphate will be exhausted
around the year 2050 by current estimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the phosphate is from Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five countries control 87% of the world
phosphate reserves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: only 7.8% with Morocco and China being the
vast majority.
[SPEAKER_00]: World reserves are estimated to last about
90 years, so as a result, Morocco and
[SPEAKER_00]: China could be what's considered the OPEC
of phosphorus in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: This graph here shows the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: imports of rock phosphate from 1900 to
2015, and you can see for the vast
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of the early going from about the
mid-90s back, we exported a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, now we're seeing an increase in
the amount of imports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, take care of today, and you'll take
care of tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We must be mindful of this problem and
manage this nutrient list in a sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasting something that can cause
environmental damage and is essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: running out is not good stewardship.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: mine rock phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while it did increase, we see it
dropping here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not because of reduction in use.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go back here, while the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: mine phosphate is going down, going back,
remember, we are starting to import more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's occurring is we're mining less
and we're importing more, and this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular nutrient that is essential for
plants, but as I said, if we are
[SPEAKER_00]: over-applying it, that can cause
groundwater contamination, which is not
[SPEAKER_00]: good, and we're now reliant more on other
countries for this vital nutrient for
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
Thank you.
Thank you.
