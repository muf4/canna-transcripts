[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're going to look at the common
plant pests called whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's advantageous when the name kind
of matches what they look like,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they do look like small whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they look like in the close-up version,
and here's a elevated population on the
[SPEAKER_00]: underside of this leaf here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the identification, they're about one
millimeter long, and a white moth-like
[SPEAKER_00]: look to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like little flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow sticky traps can be used for
monitoring, so it's good if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing those close to your plants to
be able to capture these for monitoring
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These whiteflies damage plants by sucking
the sap and vectoring the plant viruses as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only is it the physical damage they
can do, but some of the viruses that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can vector can also be a way to kind of
reduce plant's yield and cause disease to
[SPEAKER_00]: spread from plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, where to look for them, they're
typically found on the underside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a high population here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damage can be mistaken for aphid damage
initially, so it's important to kind of do
[SPEAKER_00]: that inspection, not to say, oh,
small insects kind of look a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: closer, and do you see small whiteflies?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bump the plants, you might notice
if the flies kind of show themselves as
[SPEAKER_00]: they kind of fly out and around and kind
of retreat back to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glazed look to the leaves with sticky
honeydew is a signature sign that
[SPEAKER_00]: whiteflies are nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the piercing sucking that they
are able to do to that leaf, they can kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of get that kind of glazed, kind of
sticky, nice honeydew look as the sap from
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, the sugars, are kind of being
released because of the feeding that's
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're an outdoor growing,
avoid growing eggplant, sweet potato,
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco, or tomatoes, as these can be very
common hosts for whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly, tomatoes I've seen
completely covered in whiteflies,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it can be kind of a breeding ground for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to bag and remove heavily
infected plants, so you're limiting any
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of cross-contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in indoor grow, you don't want
to pull one plant out and drag it down the
[SPEAKER_00]: hallway because that can be picked up in
the ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other plants can become infected that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to control them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's very difficult, but there's
biological controls, such as parasitic
[SPEAKER_00]: wasps that can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incarcia formosa is very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can offer effective control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind, these have a tendency to
be attracted to HID lights, those high
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sadly, they can kind of fly to their
death as a result.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to be using this kind of
parasitic wasp, typically want to find it
[SPEAKER_00]: or put it deep into the canopy where it's
more shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows a tomato leaf with whitefly
nymphs that are the white and parasitized
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that are black.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see here, this is a good sign
that the biological control is doing its
[SPEAKER_00]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little time for it to get
established and spread through the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if established properly, it can be a
method of effective control for
[SPEAKER_00]: whiteflies. Thanks.
