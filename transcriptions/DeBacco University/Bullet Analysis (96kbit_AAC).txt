[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm going to go over bullet
analysis, because typically this may be
[SPEAKER_00]: found at the crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you go about analyzing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you kind of look for in the
bullet?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I'll cover the cartridge just for
a little bit, because there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: similar markings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the bullet anatomy is
important to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, the bullet remembers the actual
projectile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually the point that's being
fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: The case is the holding container.
[SPEAKER_00]: The powder of the charge is the source of
the explosion energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The primer is the igniter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what initiates the whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wad for shotgun shells is a plastic
separated between the pellets and the
[SPEAKER_00]: powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note this is present in shotgun shell
blanks and can potentially be deadly at
[SPEAKER_00]: close range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you have a shotgun shell blank,
meaning it doesn't contain any bullets,
[SPEAKER_00]: the wad or that plastic portion does come
out of the barrel with quite some force.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're in close range, that can be
deadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't think again that a shotgun shell
blank is necessarily not deadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wad can definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it impacts someone, can definitely
cause death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the rifling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about a bullet,
we want to be thinking about the rifling
[SPEAKER_00]: of the barrel that it's traveling through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in firearms, that rifling is that
helical kind of grooves that are machined
[SPEAKER_00]: in the interior or bore surface of the
gun's barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the barrel here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a cutaway, a nice little cutaway
located right over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that rifling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That rifling causes the bullet to spin the
projectile around the longitudinal axis
[SPEAKER_00]: during shooting to help it stabilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like throwing a spiral on a
football.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it goes through this,
kind of travels here at a very high rated
[SPEAKER_00]: speed, it is spinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is going to be some markings that do
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at gun barrel rifling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, traditionally sharp-edged Lansing
grooves are replaced by less pronounced
[SPEAKER_00]: hills and valleys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the barrel bore has a kind of
polygagonal or hexagonal or octagonal
[SPEAKER_00]: cross-section profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see here eight conventional
groove rifling on the left and octagonal
[SPEAKER_00]: piloting and rifling on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some slight differences that
can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these differences, if you know how to
look and identify them, can help you
[SPEAKER_00]: correlate or match up the potential barrel
that was fired from that bullet traveled
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also something called Glock
rifling, which is a some weapons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glock pistols is just a name brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not make usable striation patterns on
fired bullets because they use that
[SPEAKER_00]: polygonal rifling instead of the
conventional rifling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one group of eight consecutive matching
strike in agreement would be considered a
[SPEAKER_00]: match matching evidence for tool marks for
this type of rifling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you're going to have a little
different pattern that's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: developing because of the type of bore
that this rifling kind of has.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be a little different set
of rules or build different ways to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to match those bullets up to that
particular barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the firing pin and ejection marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I know we're getting a little
bit away from the bullet here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you find the bullet and you find
the gun, you could find the casing as well
[SPEAKER_00]: of that cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the firing pin here and where A is
pointing to, that leaves an impression
[SPEAKER_00]: when it strikes the primer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the kind of the hammer point where it
strikes the casing cartridges of the rim
[SPEAKER_00]: and of rim fired cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be, again, a center fired
casing here, cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be important to kind of
identify that was rim fired.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be off to the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you might be looking at B saying,
well, why is it, if it's a center fired,
[SPEAKER_00]: why is there a marking here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, B is referring to the ejection mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're caused when the cartridges are
ejected from the firearm and can be used
[SPEAKER_00]: to confirm passage through the firearm if
found at the crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have chamber marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are found throughout the outer
side of the casing and are the result of
[SPEAKER_00]: regulars inside the walls of the firing
chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these are just some different
patterns that you might see in the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: casing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind the bullet's going to have
marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great place to look, but also do
not forget about looking at the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: casing as well for different marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have breach face marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where there's kind of bullet-face
signature where that end kind of comes in
[SPEAKER_00]: contact after when the explosion occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the firearms discharge,
this kind of rearward movement or recoils
[SPEAKER_00]: result of the pressure being generated the
bullet going out the barrel, but this is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there's also some
distinctive patterns that can be left.
[SPEAKER_00]: This action at the base of the cartridge
will hit the breach of the firearm,
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving a mark that can be categorized.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can, again, help you match up the
potential firearm that fired on that
[SPEAKER_00]: bullet or that, in this case, this
particular casing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking specifically at the bullet,
there'll be striations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned that rifling in the barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be striations left on
that bullet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This acts as the gun's fingerprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the same make and model of firearm
will produce distinct striations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pattern will typically hold true even
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important that when you
recover the bullet, you don't do a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: physical damage to it because these very
distinctive striations are kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: the fingerprint to that gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, there's lands and grooves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those lead to the rifling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important that the lands are the
raised portions between the grooves inside
[SPEAKER_00]: the barrel after the spiral grooves cut
into and produce the rifling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, exactly how they're oriented or how
they're tilted can tell you if it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: right twist or a left twist of that
bullet, which, again, can help you match
[SPEAKER_00]: up the potential barrel or firearm to the
bullet that it was fired from.
[SPEAKER_00]: These unique characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the number of lands and grooves,
usually four to six, but can range from
[SPEAKER_00]: two to 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the number can help you, again,
match them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diameter of the lands and grooves is
something you want to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: The width of the lands, the depth of the
lands and grooves, degree of the twist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twist is the number of inches the board is
required to complete a rifling spiral,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you want to be kind of using a
comparison of a known and a kind of what
[SPEAKER_00]: was found at the crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here this kind of matching
occurs typically with a comparison
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope because it is really done on
the detail level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you do some unique
characteristics to help you kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: identify or match up kind of the
fingerprint, if you will, of the gun or
[SPEAKER_00]: barrel to the particular bullet found at
the crime scene.
