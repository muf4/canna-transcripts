[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over the basic
steps to process information in a
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first part, there's kind of five major
categories or steps to observe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to explain those observations,
hypothesis testing, refine hypothesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat if necessary, and then communicate
findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: While they are steps, I don't want you to
think this reaches a significant or set
[SPEAKER_00]: end point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does kind of represent more of a circle
is a good way to think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are necessarily maybe repeating the
results if necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get to the end that may
generate more questions that require more
[SPEAKER_00]: observations that require you to explain
those and around and around it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now observations do not assume when you're
observing, just document what you may see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your senses when possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically in science labs taste is not
used, but you can look at what you see,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you may hear, what you may feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say do not make assumptions because
here we're looking at for observing
[SPEAKER_00]: through these cameras, you may not see
something that's very close.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, this piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of glass between those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at explainer observations,
while you may not be always able to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: an answer, it can help generate or start
the thought process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So developing kind of a sequence of
things, seeing how things may connect,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to problem solve, explain what you
may see, bring maybe others in initially
[SPEAKER_00]: for ideas are all good ways to try to
develop that initial explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of your observations, give this to
hypothesis testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hypothesis testing is used of stats
to determine the probability of a given
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesis being true or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you perform it correctly, there's
actually four steps through this that can
[SPEAKER_00]: use statistical software.
[SPEAKER_00]: So step one, formulate the null hypothesis
and alternate hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Null indicates that there's no significant
differences between trial groups and it
[SPEAKER_00]: can also be thought of occurring by pure
chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this look like in an example?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm determining a fertilizer will make
a plant grow better, the null hypothesis
[SPEAKER_00]: would say the fertilizer will not make the
plant grow better.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, the alternate
observations will show real effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning the fertilizer will make the
plants grow better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step two is using statistical tests to
determine whether or not the null
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesis will hold true.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different types here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take a stats course, you'll get
into them in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Binomial tests, one sample t-test,
chi-square tests, one-way ANOVAs,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all tests that are used to help
determine the likely or unlikelihood of a
[SPEAKER_00]: result being true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, step three is during a p-value and
it's a number between zero and one that
[SPEAKER_00]: helps determine the significance of the
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller the p-value, the stronger the
evidence against the null hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this means is that we have a
p-value of 0.05.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would mean 95% chance that the
results are against the null hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means only a 5% chance of there being
an error.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's important to have a very
small value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we may have to be calculating
this, it's important to understand this
[SPEAKER_00]: because we may be looking at data or other
people's results and they typically will
[SPEAKER_00]: include a p-value.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want you to know what that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step four is when you have that p-value,
you're comparing to the acceptable
[SPEAKER_00]: significant value sometimes called the
alpha value.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's statistically significant,
the null hypothesis is ruled out and the
[SPEAKER_00]: alternate hypothesis is determined to be
valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back again to our example of
fertilizer making plants grow better,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we fall in this range, fail to reject
the null hypothesis, this would mean
[SPEAKER_00]: likely the fertilizer did not make any
significant difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, if we're looking at, if we're above
that critical value, looking at,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, maybe that fertilizer in this case
did make a difference compared to our
[SPEAKER_00]: control group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, null hypothesis is this simply
fertilizer will not make the plants grow
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we have enough data to support it,
we may show results where that fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: did not change anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we have that p-value indicating the
results are probably not by chance
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating, well, we have a big enough
sample size and more grew better,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can cause us to reject that null
hypothesis and therefore accept our
[SPEAKER_00]: alternate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're finding that hypothesis,
if needed, consider other sources and
[SPEAKER_00]: areas of investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not too late to completely change
your hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you're looking at
something, other doors might be opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to refine that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to look at potentially
other options as you get more data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to repeat the process if
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's important to kind of think
of this as a circle even if you do get to
[SPEAKER_00]: the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often the initial ideas do not pan out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you necessarily go through the
steps with new information and develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: more refined thought process there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to communicate those
findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to communicate your
findings to others.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be officially and like a court
setting or publications or informally at
[SPEAKER_00]: like a local level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, both oral and written reports
are required at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Written reports should follow standard
scientific guidelines and should be
[SPEAKER_00]: included in introduction, background
information, methods, results,
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion, and also recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are great ways to kind of build that
community, take other people's ideas,
[SPEAKER_00]: and continue to work with them.
