[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at utilizing some sort
of machine or mechanized form of trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: your cannabis plants, this DeBaco
University video will go over some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: basics and let you know some of the
options that exist, as well as some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: advantages and disadvantages of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into using trimming
machines for trimming cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we're looking at trimming
machine options.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two main options.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're dry and wet trimming machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to depend on your chosen
basic method soon after harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, there are also different
sizes to best match the operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at first you need to determine,
are you looking at more of a dry trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: machine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you have the option to harvest your
plants and dry them and then trim them?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be doing a direct kind of
harvest trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be the main separation
between these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at trimming machine
options to consider, as I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: wet and dry trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are subsets below there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's many different options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just going to cover a basic overview that
you can go through and research further
[SPEAKER_00]: once you have a chosen path.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, looking at just the wet
trimming options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, wet trimming machines allow you to
trim more and save more space since you
[SPEAKER_00]: will not need to hang flowers by their
stem to allow them to go through a drying
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saves you time, saves you space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes wet trimming is sometimes a
necessity, particularly in larger growing
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities as they have tight time
schedules of turnaround time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incorporating a wet trimming machine will
result in faster harvest process and
[SPEAKER_00]: reduces the amount of space it takes to
dry your plants on the stem after your
[SPEAKER_00]: initial plant takedown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So important consideration there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what are some of the advantages of
wet trimming machines?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, wet trimming machines have increased
speed, which is typically a main goal for
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial or large scale growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also space savings due to reduced
plant material that is needed to be dried
[SPEAKER_00]: so that can save you areas on your dry
room or really cut down on the volume of
[SPEAKER_00]: material that's going to end up in the
dryer room, causing you to have a more
[SPEAKER_00]: control over your drying area.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages are reduced
trim quality because of the breaking of
[SPEAKER_00]: wet plant cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also not so good for potentially for
concentrates and the flowers can have a
[SPEAKER_00]: green taste and smell to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times these negatives or these
disadvantages are reasons why people
[SPEAKER_00]: select not to go with the wet trimming
option as their main option.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are dry trimming machines
and sometimes these are used as an initial
[SPEAKER_00]: way to kind of take down some of the plant
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these dry trimming machines will trim
with dry plant material as recommended
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the trichomes will be preserved
during the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at that other
option, that dry trimming option,
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing dry trims as the name implies,
again, dry plant material, but is
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended simply because the trichomes
are preserved during this process and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're kind of more degraded or injured,
shall we say, with the wet trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many machines like I got a couple
listed here for the best results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a couple listed here and we'll go
through some of these in more detail
[SPEAKER_00]: within this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the disadvantages and
advantages kind of when we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: dry trimming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with the advantages of dry trimming
are that there's many different options or
[SPEAKER_00]: styles to best fit the needs of a grower
and they cut closer than wet trimmers
[SPEAKER_00]: since no size reduction due to the
moisture content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little tighter tolerances.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also includes improved quality over
the wet trimming process.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages to using a dry
trim machine or just dry trimming in
[SPEAKER_00]: general, it does take a bit more space
since you will need to hang your flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: from the stem to dry to allow them that
process to go from the wet to the dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once they reach the dry, then they
can be utilized with these machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That duration of time, that location,
that labor should all be factored in when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're making that decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are different types of machines
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking initially at a tumbler
style trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tumbler styles are the most popular
style and work by rotating the flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: around this electrical tube, allowing for
a close trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twister trimming machines are common
because they are made for production.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can scale by placing multiple units
in line and adding an automatic feed
[SPEAKER_00]: conveyors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually link these together
and go right through and really make this
[SPEAKER_00]: process very efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are also referred to as tumblers or
trommel styles because they are rotating
[SPEAKER_00]: like a gold mining trommel, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the advantage and disadvantage of this
tumbler style was that the advantages are
[SPEAKER_00]: very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company's claim up to 45 pounds per
hour wet, 16 pounds per hour dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can trim both wet and dry material
with the change of the tumbler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're scalable as their design can
handle large batches of plant material,
[SPEAKER_00]: making them ideal for large scale
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantage is the price of these
machines tend to be more than other
[SPEAKER_00]: options available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can be initially cost prohibitive,
but keep in mind of some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: advantages when you're making your
decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's bowl style trimmers,
as we see a couple pictured right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bowl style trimmers are usually mainly
operated with a hand crank that moves the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers around the bowl, allowing them to
come in contact with the blades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Automated models can be used if you have
high plant volumes, kind of like the old
[SPEAKER_00]: salad kind of spinner concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the advantages and disadvantages of
this type is that you can control the
[SPEAKER_00]: speed via the hand crank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very affordable options and balances
efficiency and cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're kind of getting a blending of
the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it can remove excessive plant
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really recommended only for
dry flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wet flowers are going to have a tendency
to clog all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while it says variable speed,
keep in mind, you're the one providing a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be great the first couple of
times, but you might be getting tired or
[SPEAKER_00]: fatigued as you get through, especially a
larger harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also then stand up trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the name implies, they actually,
they stand up and are operated by manually
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly moving the flowers back and forth
over the grate with a fan running
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath, catching any material that
passes through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see these different types,
but they're all kind of have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: general category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would someone utilize one of these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the stand up trimming is that you
can adjust the speed the plant materials
[SPEAKER_00]: move through while the blade remains at a
constant speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a little bit more control and
specificity with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantages is your hands will end
up very close to moving blades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we see here, like a
warning, don't stick your hands down here
[SPEAKER_00]: because there are moving blades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this really also is advised for dry
trimming only simply because if you did
[SPEAKER_00]: this with wet trimming, you have a great
tendency of clogging this entire area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have also bag style trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are operated by placing the
flowers in the bag and rotating the bag in
[SPEAKER_00]: different directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see a couple of different styles
here with bag style trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers usually select to use a bag style
trimmer since they have control of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bag, since they're mainly operated or
mainly turned.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very lightweight and compact for
easy storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not doing a lot of perpetual
harvesting, they're affordable and still
[SPEAKER_00]: very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, someone would choose not to use a
bag style trimmer simply because flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: can break apart due to the physical
shaking that occurs and it is a labor
[SPEAKER_00]: intensive process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this gives you kind of an
idea of some of the machines that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available if you're looking at considering
these to allow you to make an informed
[SPEAKER_00]: decision, at least at the category.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can look specifically at what
brands or details or options you might get
[SPEAKER_00]: within that category.
Thank you.
Thank you.
