[SPEAKER_02]: In this DeBaco University video,
we're going to hear from the two students
[SPEAKER_02]: you've probably seen in the student
series, Kiera and Connor, who are students
[SPEAKER_02]: of the Fall 2022 semester.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we can have a little introduction
so you can learn a little bit more about
[SPEAKER_02]: them than just what you've seen in the
videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before we get to the student
introductions, as a teacher it's important
[SPEAKER_02]: to pass on what you have learned to see
where you're students take that
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just what we're going to see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of these students have had before and
it's been great working with both of them,
[SPEAKER_02]: Kiera and Connor, and hopefully you have
enjoyed some of the videos they've
[SPEAKER_02]: appeared in on this channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: This video will help provide a brief
introduction to both students.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Kiera has continued to show interest in
cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_02]: She goes beyond just the coursework.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's worked on an independent study.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's taken an intro course, an advanced
course, as well as some outreach.
[SPEAKER_02]: She has appeared in DeBaco University
videos and is continually expanding her
[SPEAKER_02]: education and enjoys sharing it with
others.
[SPEAKER_02]: She also has started a YouTube channel as
well as an Instagram account that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: both follow and look at there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have Connor, who after taking
both the introduction to cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: horticulture and also the advanced course
that I offer, is now the lead cultivator
[SPEAKER_02]: at a large production greenhouse
operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The information from the course has proven
to be helpful on a daily basis for him and
[SPEAKER_02]: he's been willing to share some of the
experiences here on DeBaco University.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go into the introduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let those students give you a little
bit of their brief background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name is Kiera Ulmer and I am a
junior at UConn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't start my college journey at UConn
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually began over in Rhode Island at
Bryant University, but business really
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't my strong suit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I came to UConn in the pursuit to take
Professor DeBaco's intro to horticulture
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis class.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually the first thing I told my
advisor was that I needed to take the this
[SPEAKER_00]: class and thankfully I was able to take
both the intro and the advanced course.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, the professor and I engineered
our own little independent study over the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer so that I can continue my cannabis
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are still going even now into the
fall semester.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm helping out with some of his class and
being able to see what's going on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if any of you go to UConn and ever see
me around and want to say hi, ask about a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis question, I am more than open to
talk to anyone who has interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and make sure to follow me on
Instagram and YouTube at Kana Kiera
[SPEAKER_00]: spelled K-A-N-N-A-K-I-E-R-A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to seeing you then.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's everybody doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Connor and I am here working
with Professor DeBaco.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a University of Connecticut alumni.
[SPEAKER_01]: I graduated last semester.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Professor DeBaco through the
horticulture of cannabis course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took both the intro and the advanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be wondering what am I doing
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have moved on from the courses and
am now actually leading cultivation here
[SPEAKER_01]: at Sweet Heel CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's been a blast getting to
really learn this plant, the ins and outs
[SPEAKER_01]: and all the responsibility that comes with
running your own greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Professor DeBaco has really set me up
to do just that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
