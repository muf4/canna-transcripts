[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to be going over rockwool size
[SPEAKER_00]: options for indoor cannabis plant
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be just more than what you're
thinking of.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers use rockwool at the early
stages, but did you know it can be used
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the full growth cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to go over some of those
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's explore some of the
options we got for rockwool for your
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor cannabis plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, Grotian Stonewool or
rockwool here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many brands, but this is a very popular
one when both commercial and hobby
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwool is made from molten rock spun
into a cotton candy like fiber that is
[SPEAKER_00]: then compressed into cubes, blocks or
slabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's manmade, it does allow for
the freedom to be made into a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwool can absorb nutrient solution and
help maintain aeration, which are both
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial to the plant on both the small
scale and also the large scale growth
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to look at the propagation
stages where people may be or growers may
[SPEAKER_00]: be most familiar with rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seedlings, startings and cubes are easily
transferred into blocks and then into
[SPEAKER_00]: slabs if desired.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes it very advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seedlings or cuttings started in Grotian
cubes can be transplanted into more
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional planters or also growing
mediums.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why people might be familiar with
rockwool at the starter stage and then
[SPEAKER_00]: might progress to other substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grotian makes OK starter plugs,
macro plugs and AOK starter plugs just to
[SPEAKER_00]: give some examples that are of the variety
that you have even in just the propagation
[SPEAKER_00]: stage of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to growing blocks as we can see
here, here's quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see the clones here being grown in
the little starter plugs and then they're
[SPEAKER_00]: placed directly into its form fit into the
blocks here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seedings or cuttings started in
these larger Grotian blocks and once
[SPEAKER_00]: rooted the blocks are then transferred to
a larger stonewool slab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow blocks can also be planted directly
into containers for soil gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a strip of four inch by four
inch Grotian blocks each with preformed
[SPEAKER_00]: holes in them to accept those little
starter plugs there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes for a very easy transfer,
makes for a very efficient transfer and
[SPEAKER_00]: also a very time efficient transfer as
well with minimal root disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now growing slabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grotian slabs are used in the final stage
of planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are kind of the largest.
[SPEAKER_00]: These slabs come in clearly marked UV
resistant poly sleeves for ease of use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's recommended for larger long-term
crops with extensive root structures like
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, peppers, tomatoes or even
cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically seedlings and blocks are placed
into the slabs as kind of the next level
[SPEAKER_00]: of progression in the grow cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now lastly, combining the blocks in the
slabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that actually kind of look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see some great examples of that
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows for minimal root disturbance
as the two components naturally work
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also of the very similar material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's allowing those roots to kind of
go through and transfer from one to the
[SPEAKER_00]: other very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the block can be placed directly on the
slab to allow the roots to continue
[SPEAKER_00]: growing from that block right into the
slab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here on the large production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here kind of a zoomed in
version.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it look like from the root
standpoint?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is kind of a great cutaway.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing the roots that were initially
started in that block have now progressed
[SPEAKER_00]: to and are starting to spread throughout
the slab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're allowing for that expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why Rockwell can be used from the
very start to the very end because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: options that it provides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the root friendly and plant therefore
plant friendly environment that it can
[SPEAKER_00]: create throughout the propagation stage
all the way to the final harvest stage.
