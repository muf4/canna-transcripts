[SPEAKER_00]: So in this Tabaco University video,
we're going to be looking at crime scene
[SPEAKER_00]: classification and a couple examples as
well as how we would classify certain
[SPEAKER_00]: crimes given some information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we want to think about what
types of crimes are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's homicides, burglary, sexual
assault, and there's drug offenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's many more.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just a couple examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here a list of types of crime,
the frequency and percentage that they
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some definitely more comments,
such as burglary definitely much more
[SPEAKER_00]: common than some of the other ones listed
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, we have to take all these into
consideration and know how to handle these
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're not sure what crime scene
we're going to be coming up to when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing an investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also looking at crime scenes,
we're also looking at how age could play a
[SPEAKER_00]: factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some crimes simply are more likely to be
committed by certain age groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where it doesn't give us an
idea of what individual committed what
[SPEAKER_00]: crime, but it can increase the odds of
when we identify an individual or identify
[SPEAKER_00]: a crime, what age group might we be
looking at as far as increased odds based
[SPEAKER_00]: on the information here in the data to
look at who we might be looking for a
[SPEAKER_00]: potential suspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have our physical locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that we have indoor
locations, we have outdoor locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have car or vehicle locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these have their own challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we must take these all into
consideration, be able to handle any of
[SPEAKER_00]: these because sometimes we even have
multiple physical locations involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a victim's location specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're looking at a primary crime
scene because this is the original
[SPEAKER_00]: location of the crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I mentioned, it could also be
secondary crime scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of an alternate location
where additional evidence may be found.
[SPEAKER_00]: A body could have been murdered at one
place and transported to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that just because we're
observing one particular crime scene,
[SPEAKER_00]: we might be thinking about the potential
for there to be another crime scene that
[SPEAKER_00]: may also need to be investigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get looking at the size of the scene in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that there can be
everything from the macroscopic down to
[SPEAKER_00]: the microscopic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a macroscopic scene contains many
microscopic scenes within it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Macroscopic is basically where the body is
found in a field, a gunshot to a victim,
[SPEAKER_00]: something we can see very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microscopic has trace evidence such as a
gunshot residue, tire tread marks,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the whole host of trace evidence that
we could be looking at investigating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that we want to be mindful
of the large scale items, but also don't
[SPEAKER_00]: forget about the small scale items as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we're classifying a scene,
so here's just one example where thieves
[SPEAKER_00]: break into a jewelry store, jewelry is
taken, the suspect gets in a getaway car,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the stolen goods are taken to their
apartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, how would you classify this scene?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of like example A.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to think about this,
pause the video here and think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer will be revealed on the next
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the scene, how do we
classify it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with the information presented here,
we'd be looking at it'd be a robbery,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'd be the type of crime, it'd be located
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The primary scene would be the jewelry
store, but we also have the secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: scene of the thieves' getaway car and also
their apartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is just how we would
classify the example of that scene
[SPEAKER_00]: provided there as exhibit A.
[SPEAKER_00]: For exhibit B here, looking at this
scenario, a man was strangled in his home.
[SPEAKER_00]: The perpetrators used the man's van to
transport the body and dump it in a nearby
[SPEAKER_00]: lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we go about the classification of
this scene as exhibit B?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pause the video here before I reveal the
answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking here at our exhibit B,
how do we classify this scene?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with the information presented,
here's what we'd be looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: The type of crime would be a homicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The physical location or locations would
be both indoors and outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The primary scene would be the indoor,
the home of the victim who was stabbed or
[SPEAKER_00]: shot by the offender and is, in this case,
strangled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our secondary scene would be outdoors
since this would involve the van and the
[SPEAKER_00]: point at the lake where the victim was
dumped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be considered a secondary crime
scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just gives a brief example of how
we'd be comparing and classifying two
[SPEAKER_00]: different examples of crime scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pause the video here before I reveal the
answers.
