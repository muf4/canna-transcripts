[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBacco University video,
I'm going to go over the many uses of
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon peroxide in the garden,
which include going over how it can help
[SPEAKER_00]: improve your seed germination,
how it can utilize it to sterilize your
[SPEAKER_00]: tools, as well as control potential
foliar, as well as soil-based diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come along and learn about how this
very simple product can have multiple uses
[SPEAKER_00]: for your benefit in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, first off, we should start with
basically, what is hydrogen peroxide?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a simple molecule, H2O2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light can break it down and basically
cause the original molecule to form into
[SPEAKER_00]: water, and oxygen and the gaseous form
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of a pretty benign end products
here, water and oxygen gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part what makes the end result so
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we want to be careful with the
original product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the general mode of action,
how does something so simple work?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially the decomposition process
releases an oxygen and produces a hydroxyl
[SPEAKER_00]: free radical that damages proteins and
DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where it can kind of help
reduce the presence of certain diseases,
[SPEAKER_00]: certain bacteria, certain funguses,
and potentially even viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, from a user standpoint,
we want to be aware and cautious of
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen peroxide because it does have a
strong oxidizing agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a mucous membrane irritant and
can cause what's called peroxide burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get it on you in high
concentrations, it'll literally turn your
[SPEAKER_00]: skin white.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're applying especially higher
concentrations in closed environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will feel potential irritation on your
mucous membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you spill it anywhere, be advised
that it is an oxidizing agent can also be
[SPEAKER_00]: corrosive.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the advantages of using
this though?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, as I hinted to it before,
it can kill both fungi and bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copper also fits into this category,
but as many other issues such as
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions with other products can have
phytotoxicity, can have long residuals,
[SPEAKER_00]: can also be an environmental contaminant
if you're adding a lot of copper
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrogen peroxide really does not have any
of those negative effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also there's no residue left behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So other products you may have applied,
you may go back after it dries on the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves and get kind of this white residue
that will not happen with hydrogen
peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, no product is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are some disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have a very short residual time,
meaning it doesn't last for very long,
[SPEAKER_00]: not very, light as it said, breaks it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't last very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can require frequent applications and
can only kill what it comes in contact
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means if you're not getting good
spray coverage or good even spray
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage, you're not going to really see
the benefits as much as you would if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting uniform, consistent spray
coverage there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really a fine coverage as well will
help increase the effectiveness of this
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's important to know at this point
that I'm not sponsored by any particular
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: All products were purchased at retail
cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no sponsorship of any kind on the
products mentioned here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind that this is my
honest opinion based on what I've gone out
[SPEAKER_00]: and purchased just like you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are some common hydrogen
peroxide that is typically found to be
[SPEAKER_00]: around 3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does come typically in a light block
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to avoid high heat as well as
shaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does have a shelf life that will be
listed on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why you don't want to shake it
is by the shaking motion of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will cause the degradation of that
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why you be mindful of the shelf
life and not that it necessarily goes bad
[SPEAKER_00]: and will cause any harm, just the
percentage listed that 3% will start to
[SPEAKER_00]: degrade and break down from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also store it in a cool
environment that'll help prolong the life
[SPEAKER_00]: of the product as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also general concentrated hydrogen
peroxide products.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, we're mentioning here in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these concentrated products shown here,
even though they might be food grade,
[SPEAKER_00]: are around the 10 to 35%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are typically found off labeled
pool products, sterilizers, or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is recommended that you purchase a
product for your intended purpose and
[SPEAKER_00]: follow the printed label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while these might be the same product,
if they're not recommended for
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural purposes, they're not going
to be the focus here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though they say food grade,
that's for food consumption grade,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not necessarily assumes that they
can be applied to food based on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So agricultural focused products are going
to be the ones, again, focused here.
[SPEAKER_00]: BioSafe Systems as product lines,
which I'm going to focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have items that you may be familiar
with such as xerotal, oxidate,
[SPEAKER_00]: sanitate, and terra clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the four main uses that I'm going to
dive into detail here are going to be how
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen peroxide can help improve seed
germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: How it can be used to sterilize tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: How it can be applied for foliar diseases
as well as soil treatments for soil borne
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to focus on these four in
great detail and hopefully give you some
[SPEAKER_00]: specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the improved seed
germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soaking in plain water is effective and
for known difficult seeds, adding
[SPEAKER_00]: gibberellic acid or GAs is suggested.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, GAs have a shelf life,
can be hard to get and acquire a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: PPM or parts per million concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: To really be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why some growers will suggest
adding kelp to the water of seeds and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, are going to be soaked,
but this is typically a random dilution
[SPEAKER_00]: with inherent variability of the hormone
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if it does help, it's not really a
repeatable method.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to this using hydrogen
peroxide has been proven to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: germination rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's needed low concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to get and can be used for other
purposes both in and out of the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a research article here that
I'm going to pull some data from,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I always like to provide the original
protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take a look here if you wanted
to know any of the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the research data original
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you a brief summary
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the research findings, again,
this is kind of an idea of what they were
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at to get to the result.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked at seed sterilization,
germination and seedling development were
[SPEAKER_00]: carried out in a hydrogen peroxide
solution at different concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in short, they found that 1% hydrogen
peroxide solution showed the fastest and
[SPEAKER_00]: most efficient germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: High germination efficiency for very old
seeds with lower viability was also
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrated in their study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This protocol demonstrates that superior
germination compared to water control and
[SPEAKER_00]: reduces the risk of contamination,
making it suitable for tissue culture and
[SPEAKER_00]: other sensitive applications, as well as
any applications you might be going into
[SPEAKER_00]: such as rockwool or cement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil or soilless media, any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This water control compares to the 1% and
they even went higher than 1%,
[SPEAKER_00]: but 1% was shown to be the most effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seed soaking solution here,
and again, I'm just showing you regular
[SPEAKER_00]: generic store purchased hydrogen peroxide
is really what I recommend here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to generate that 1% solution
because this is a 3% solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one part hydrogen peroxide and two
parts water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give you some examples here in both
ounces as well as millions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can effectively or easily get to
that 1% ultimate concentration from that
[SPEAKER_00]: 3% solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those that want to know the math
behind it, it's C1V1 equals C2V2,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you've got concentration of the
original material and volume of the
[SPEAKER_00]: original material equaling the
concentration and the volume of the
[SPEAKER_00]: resulting material there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go through and do your
calculations as you see fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I mentioned something else,
that hydrogen peroxide can also be used to
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilize tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frequent cleaning of tools can help
prevent the grower from being a vector for
[SPEAKER_00]: disease and spreading from one plant to
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of you pruning one plant to
another and another, spreading that
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, putting your tools or soaking
your tools in this can help reduce that
[SPEAKER_00]: chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a small container of what's called
sanity solution can make it easy for
[SPEAKER_00]: growers to do quick submersion of the
tools they are using to simply clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note though, if viruses are the main
concern, milk would be advised for this
[SPEAKER_00]: specific purpose as the protein coat the
virus part particles in the proteins from
[SPEAKER_00]: the milk, I should say coat the virus
particles to reduce the chance of the
[SPEAKER_00]: virus binding to plant cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was common practice for planters
of tobacco, dipping their hands in milk to
[SPEAKER_00]: again, prevent them from being vectors or
spreading tobacco mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now tool sterilization solution,
note this is not a cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the tools are being used are very
dirty, be sure to remove the other means,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bulk of the organic matter on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see that these are quote,
dirty tools here with a lot of the soil or
[SPEAKER_00]: sand or just generally organic material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially the tool should be pre-cleaned
for this to have maximum effectiveness,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning the hydrogen peroxide will be much
reduced in effectiveness if you have these
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt particles here already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to kind of clean them maybe with
soapy water and then follow up with a
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide treatment and you'll get the most
effectiveness from that treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this solution here should make it
fresh daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once diluted, the solution should be used
for that day or even potentially less if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing a high volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: If exposed to direct sunlight,
this will speed up the degradation process
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially the active ingredient will
start to break down and become less
[SPEAKER_00]: effective if it's stored for a long period
of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as we see here, we have a clear
container, clearly some tinge to that
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably these tools put in there a little
dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to have much less effect in
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it was a light block container and
the tools were pre-cleaned before and then
[SPEAKER_00]: dipped in the sanitizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using it frequently,
for example tomato pruning, you may want
[SPEAKER_00]: to make a new mix of solution midday to
help ensure the maximum and consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilizing power of the original
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now two sterilizers with that
concentration, what should we be looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at to keep our tools not only visually
clean, but also clean of potential
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when cleaning tools, the higher end of
the range can be used with little threat
[SPEAKER_00]: of damage to the tool, plant or user.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can can favor it a little bit on
the higher end of the scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will always look like a clear water
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure to put it in a special labeled
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you and others know that that is a
hydrogen peroxide solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, a final submersion
in the solution followed by a rinse can
[SPEAKER_00]: help reduce the chance of corrosion of the
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't want to just like leave it
soaking on there because it could damage
[SPEAKER_00]: your equipment if you're doing it daily
and for long soaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to just give it a quick rinse
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully keep your tools nice and clean
and also giving them a long life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I recommend specifically for this
would be the Sanidate 5.0 product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically 1.6 to 5.4 fluid ounces of this
product with five gallons of potable
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically a conversion of that would be 47
to 160 milliliters to 19 liters of potable
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ideal solution for controlling plant
and human health pathogens on a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: hard non-porous surfaces, such as floors,
tables, benches, tools, equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: restrooms, and more are listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to provide you with the label
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an example of the product,
but by all means take a look at this maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: in more detail and look at the full
extensive specimen label before purchasing
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the third item that I mentioned was
foiler applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the few bactericides that
exist in general, but it also does work on
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's kind of a list of everything
that's on the label for leaf and soil
[SPEAKER_00]: based pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is for Xerotal 2.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just kind of highlighted the two
here, Alternaria, a very common one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And powdery mildew, also what it looks
like on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now again, as stated on the label,
tobacco mosaic virus is listed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but again, if viruses are your main
control, I think there's products that are
[SPEAKER_00]: more effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see it's not just Alternaria,
powdery mildew, Fusarium, which we'll talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about at the end, Anthracnose,
Petritis, Downy mildew potentially as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, Pythium, Rust and scabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see a wide variety listed at
least on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So advantage to the foiler application is
that there simply is no residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This reduces the chance of burning the
plant causing phyotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to follow the recommended
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: As with high concentrations, there can be
peroxide burn of the plant material if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're mixing it too strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is still a chance of that
burning, but the ideal is no residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by keeping those concentrations
following those, not just adding a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more, that's what's going to cause the
peroxide or the chance of a peroxide burn
[SPEAKER_00]: be mindful of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, the product does break down
into water and oxygen gas, but if it's too
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated, there is that always run
that risk of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like on your hands, that peroxide
burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: But regardless, there'll still be no
residue, leaving your leaves nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean and shiny with no white spots or
chance of interactions with products
[SPEAKER_00]: applied after or even before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the complete coverage is really
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this and really any other contact
product, good plant coverage is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important as this has a direct impact on
the effectiveness of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see here, find a medium
coarse, very coarse or extra coarse kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of sprays and the gallons per acre
suggested applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also take a card and kind of get
an idea of what kind of coverage you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Investing in a good applicator or
applicating equipment is advised as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as the applicator themselves taking the
time to do it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A mister or fogger, where allowed,
offers the greatest coverage in a short
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time that is also very reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And repeatable process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hand pump mechanical sprayers can be used,
but time should be used to help ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: complete plant coverage, which can be time
consuming to do properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now getting into the fuller application
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the recommended product, Xerotol or
Oxidate, they're both Omri listed,
[SPEAKER_00]: would be in this category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that both of these have the same
active ingredients in concentrations and
[SPEAKER_00]: also the same EPA registration numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we can see right here, and right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that sometimes one is approved to be
applied while the other may not be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check your local regulations and I
would recommend you check them yearly
[SPEAKER_00]: because sometimes things can change.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, Oxidate in at least one state
as a restriction that no further
[SPEAKER_00]: applications are allowed, but Xerotol does
not have this same restriction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting the 5.0 is a more concentrated
version of the 2.0 and you simply use
[SPEAKER_00]: less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you're getting like,
for example, Oxidate 2.0 versus 5.0,
[SPEAKER_00]: be aware of that because your dilution
rates are going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of product you're going to need
to add of the 5.0 is of course going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: less than the 2.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just as a reminder for that to
reduce the chance of you doing
[SPEAKER_00]: unintentional plant damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the last one mentioned here was soil
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you a little bit of a
background on this as well, and as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: an in-field example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where hydrogen peroxide is
showing greater interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some initial results are the reason
for its continued use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some areas have strict regulations on
products for controlling soil-based
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really for good reason as
these can have long residuals and negative
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts on non-target environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certain fumigation products,
while initially showed some promise,
[SPEAKER_00]: the kind of risk-reward benefit that risk
the environment is a little bit higher
[SPEAKER_00]: than should be really allowed in some
cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the benefits were shown to be in some
cases variable at best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the soil treatment, hydrogen peroxide
can control wide range of soil-based
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases with low residual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will not have long-term negative
impacts on the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is much easier and cost-effective
compared to steam sterilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while steam sterilization may be the
better option, it's not easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is costly in both labor and equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this offers another alternative that
might be better utilized by more people to
[SPEAKER_00]: get some effectiveness rather than doing
nothing if they cannot perform true steam
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the site prep here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are still some site prep that
should be implemented to help improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide if
you're going to be utilizing it as a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, you want to clear the crop
residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some can be on the surface and or
partially incorporated into the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a lot of plant residue will simply
reduce the soil penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to have it like this would be
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be considered to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to have like a large amount
of residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simply going to reduce the amount of
percolation you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil surface should be quick or kind
of rough tilled to allow for greater
[SPEAKER_00]: percolation into the soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have like a solid locked
up layer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to kind of have it start to be
kind of broken up to allow that water to
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrate, to allow that peroxide also to
penetrate quickly into that soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally after application, you should not
till the soil as this will just dilute the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil cleaning that you performed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you basically kill that and
clean up the first inch and then you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: mix it up, well, now you've just kind of
reduced the amount of effectiveness of
[SPEAKER_00]: that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you can do post application until
if you think the main concentration of
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen is just in that very top surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can incorporate there if that's
where your target is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil should have some moisture to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: More water will be added as you drench,
but if the soil is dry, this reduces the
[SPEAKER_00]: water movement into the soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that soil is already moist,
the capillary action will take that water
[SPEAKER_00]: deeper and offer better cleaning of that
soil and removal of those pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what solution to recommend for this
will TerraClean 5.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is recommended as intended for
outdoor soil based applications prior to
[SPEAKER_00]: planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rate at three gallons of TerraClean in
275 gallons of water over a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This produces a 300 part per million
solution, which is the rate being
[SPEAKER_00]: suggested by other growers and what seems
to be generally accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So giving you that kind of at least a good
starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at some specifics to remember,
when we're looking at a soil based
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment, when using TerraClean 5.0,
it's important to have everything ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: go as the last step is the mixing and the
applying.
[SPEAKER_00]: An evening application is preferred to
reduce the UV light, which will break down
[SPEAKER_00]: the hydrogen peroxide as this will simply
degrade it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're applying it in times of low
light, that just increases the odds that
[SPEAKER_00]: it will last even just that little bit
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the concentrate is added and mix it
well and apply it, do not let it sit for
[SPEAKER_00]: extended periods of time because it will
start to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to break down because you want
that breakdown process and what's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow that effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you kind of mix it all and kind of
wait and hang around and have a bright
[SPEAKER_00]: sunny day, that's just simply going to
reduce that total concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like to think of it's kind of
like setting up for a pit stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you come in, everything's
prepped to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get everything ready to go and kind of
turn it around pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that breakdown is again what you
want, but this makes it effective,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it should also be occurring in the
soil and you don't want it to be occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: in the tank or where you don't have that
pathogen present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do you go about delivering this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this can be applied via diluted in a
large tank or injected via a chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: rejector.
[SPEAKER_00]: The end result is essentially the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a diluted water tank or a
chemical injector.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same end concentration is really the
goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do caution you if you are using an
injector system to make sure you run plain
[SPEAKER_00]: water through the system when you're done
to reduce the chance of corrosion on
[SPEAKER_00]: internal components of the injector or any
fittings you may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same would be advised for a tank
system to make sure your pump doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: that speeding up of any corrosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So post-soil treatment, you can add back
beneficial microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The manufacturer says these can be added
only two hours after the peroxide
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when the you may see some foaming
of the soil surface during the
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that's basically dissipated,
you ideally can add back your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, giving the area an unofficial
smell test, the microbes, for in my case,
[SPEAKER_00]: I did add them 48 hours post application,
as this is when the distinctive hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide smell could no longer be
detected.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I deemed it to be safe to add
the microbes back without the chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: them being killed by the peroxide there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The manufacturer says, and it's definitely
evident in the first two hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's definitely a lot of reaction,
but I could just smell it a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't super rushed, so I did wait two
days, not the two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now moving on to the soil treatment and
the microbe replenishment of the TeraGrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So following the manufacturer
recommendations, TeraGrow was added to the
[SPEAKER_00]: same area that was treated with the
TeraClean product 48 hours prior.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does contain molasses and beneficial
microbes and was applied over the same
[SPEAKER_00]: area with less water since the soil was
still saturated from the original
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that cold and cloudy
conditions, particularly that of the early
[SPEAKER_00]: spring, can reduce evaporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what the product kind of looks like,
it's kind of a powdered product,
[SPEAKER_00]: you add it to water, it dilutes very well
and very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how important this step may
be, but it was still followed based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations from the manufacturer,
and this is an OMRI certified product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is soil treatment limitations,
so this will not solve all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: potential pathogen issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does seem at least to delay the onset
of soil-borne diseases, this hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: While steam sterilization of the soil
would be the most effective, the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: cost, and labor to accomplish this is
drastically more than the hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you can still do this steam
sterilization, that would be advised,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this may be prohibitive for a lot of
growers, so this is offered as another
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how does the soil treatment of
hydrogen peroxide compare to a mustard
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the advantage of hydrogen peroxide
treatment is that it can be accomplished
[SPEAKER_00]: within 48 hours of removing the plant,
or even less.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you follow the two hours suggested by
the manufacturer, it could potentially all
[SPEAKER_00]: be done in one single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can help allow the grower to select a
soil-stabilizing cover crop instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get a mustard crop up to flower
incorporated, sealed, before getting to
[SPEAKER_00]: the winter cover crop seeded and
germinated in time for the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: season, particularly for those growing
long duration outdoor crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The peroxide treatment followed
immediately, I should say was followed
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately with a grass seed cover crop,
seems to be easy and effective and ensures
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal soil erosion, and helps ensure a
little bit of a rotation there with a
[SPEAKER_00]: monocrop if you're growing a daikon or
other crop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my personal experience here,
just to give you a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: background here of what I'm relating this
to, is that while growing site was treated
[SPEAKER_00]: with this hydrogen peroxide, it did end up
getting lab confirmed root-based fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I want to add a little caveat to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vine that was infected was about the
fifth from the end when the plant was
[SPEAKER_00]: being removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the older growth, and that's the
growth that was like original,
[SPEAKER_00]: was cleaned on the internal vine portion
as well as the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pumpkin did develop a rot spot leading
to an unofficial wait, but in a DQ at the
[SPEAKER_00]: weigh-off, we can see what it looked like
and weighed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two days after weighing the pumpkin was
cut up, we can see the evidence right
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and expecting a rotten mess of soup
on the inside, actually exactly the
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite was observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pumpkin was perfect on the inside,
so no signs of rot, so the seeds were
[SPEAKER_00]: actually harvested, and everything was all
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the rot spot was, was an external
rot, not an internal rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though there was lab-diagnosed
fusarium in a portion of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it did not get to the internals of the
pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a kind of sign that this
hydrogen peroxide treatment may certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: have had some benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see how the leaves look during the
season, which definitely kept them
[SPEAKER_00]: healthier longer, which is, again,
another positive experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking back at the treatments,
we can see here how they degraded,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this was the vine here that was
removed because it was being set to the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab where the infection originally
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: The oddity of the fusarium showing up on
the newer growth and while causing some
[SPEAKER_00]: plant issues, not getting into the
pumpkin, or really traveling down the vine
[SPEAKER_00]: indicates low levels of inoculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why was there a fusarium and that's
kind of the obvious question, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: fair to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to the late season onset and the odd
location, this is likely due to simply
[SPEAKER_00]: missing an area when performing the
drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting area was small and basically
caught early and then isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure to get the entire growing area
when performing this treatment because any
[SPEAKER_00]: areas you miss could create a pocket of
disease, particularly soil-borne disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: that could spread to other portions of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now soil treatment going forward,
looking at this, you know, one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusions based on what I have observed,
the plan is to continue with this soil
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment to reduce disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it may not be 100% effective,
the delayed onset and mitigation of most
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure sure makes it more effective than
many of the harsher chemical options that
[SPEAKER_00]: exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I point you to this image here where
the newer growth versus the older growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: the older root, of course, had the
fusarium first and the newer growth was
[SPEAKER_00]: still healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's in case I found it early,
but this again was later in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, to be able to support over
1,100 pound pumpkin definitely shows that
[SPEAKER_00]: there were still some actively growing
plant material, but I wanted to remove
[SPEAKER_00]: that and take some plant out for part of
the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was interesting to see where the
isolation of the disease actually was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soil treatment, other factors,
again, just trying to keep in mind is that
[SPEAKER_00]: this is only a supplement for disease
mitigation plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover crops are still an important
component.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want you to think this is a
replacement for cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be used in addition to cover
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: For many soil-based diseases, you want to
reduce the chance of overwatering and
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive nitrogen applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adding a lot of nitrogen fertilizer and
overwatering are going to encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: By you being aware of that and knowing
what you have, that'll help naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: create an environment that won't allow
diseases to naturally be able to spread
[SPEAKER_00]: quite aggressively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep this in mind that there's a
disease trying to lead the host
[SPEAKER_00]: environment pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be one thing to kind of help
reduce the amount of pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep up the other two and cover
crop and be mindful of your environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: growing conditions, this could be a
effective way to reduce the onset and
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the severity of a disease that
you're seeing in your crops.
Thank you.
