[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanted to learn about deep water
culture, then this DeBaco University video
[SPEAKER_00]: is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into deep water
culture, abbreviated DWC for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the basics of deep water culture are
the fact that it does not use a growing
[SPEAKER_00]: medium or substrate, but instead plants
roots are held in a special pot or
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that right over on this side over
here with a five gallon pail system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the components that's
required.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this other side we see kind of
represented in a cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the system entails is that the roots
are essentially immersed in a pool of
[SPEAKER_00]: aerated nutrient rich water, which allow
for easy access to oxygen and nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the attractiveness of this system is
that it can be automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no need, and there's also no
need to worry about over or under watering
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The system can easily be automated once
initially set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this may not be the best option
for new growers due to the lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: buffering ability of the water solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers have little room for error.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great when it looks like this,
and this is definitely possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there is potential for pH swings
that aren't monitored or new growers and
[SPEAKER_00]: attentive to those, this can cause the
entire plant to die in a relatively short
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the basic setup to this is that
there's a reservoir, a DWC net pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: which kind of will support that substrate,
water soluble nutrient, and then an air
[SPEAKER_00]: pump as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're typically sold as kits,
we can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the water nutrient reservoir,
the reservoir contains a water soluble
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient solution that the plant's roots
grow in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: To help avoid potential algae growth,
the container should be light tight,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not necessarily airtight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning we don't want to have light
getting in here, but we don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: want it completely solidly sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do potentially want some exchange of
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some systems are sized for one plant,
others are sized to hold multiple plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since all plants will be in the same
solution, it is advised to only grow the
[SPEAKER_00]: same type of plant at the same stage in
the same reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're growing one in flower,
one in veg, one in propagation,
[SPEAKER_00]: that could cause some potential nutrient
imbalances, or really reduce your overall
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency of plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we're looking at the DWC or net
pots, these have a wide or large mesh to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow support of the root system,
but still provide plenty of room for the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots to expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing special, so they can be
homemade, but are often store bought to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow for standardization, as we can see
right here below me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example, some homemade ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers may choose to fill these with
some inert medium, but this is often not
[SPEAKER_00]: required unless plants are initially
placed in these containers when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see some growing pebbles used,
sometimes rockwool is used, but you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as the plant's a little bit older,
just basically put them right in the pot
[SPEAKER_00]: with no need for any additional
substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the water soluble nutrient solution,
you want to follow the recommended rates
[SPEAKER_00]: of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on the fertilizer company's
suggestions, because that is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: starting point, or when in doubt,
favor a little bit less.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the growers responsible for
regulation of the pH to ensure the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient availability for efficient
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The target pH should be around 5.8,
with an acceptable range of 5.5 to 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically a little bit more acidic than we
would in a natural soil-based solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: To ensure growers need to have a continual
water monitor for pH, but nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations and temperature are also
environmental factors to monitor as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH is very important, but don't only
monitor pH, the concentration of those
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and the temperature of that
nutrient solution are other things growers
[SPEAKER_00]: should be monitoring and keeping a
continual eye on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some that we'll go through and
add an additional air pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general world, the air pump should
apply at least double the liters per hour
[SPEAKER_00]: of the volume of your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole goal here is to keep the
nutrient solution moving and also allow
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh oxygen and air to those root systems
that will be growing in those water
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you had a hundred liter
water tank, you should have a air pump
[SPEAKER_00]: that would supply at least 200 liters per
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers are advised to get backups to
ensure a quick change if a pump fails,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that is one of the downfalls of
the system, that it is dependent on
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully these little tips and kind of
brief overview of the deep water culture
[SPEAKER_00]: gives you a better understanding of how
this can be utilized for cannabis production.
