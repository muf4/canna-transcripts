[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're looking at the central
and peripheral nervous systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This image provides a good kind of
breakdown of what's part of the central
[SPEAKER_00]: nervous system, which is made up of the
brain and spinal cord, and then what's
[SPEAKER_00]: made of the peripheral nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's typically our nerves and things
that connect to the brain and ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: the spinal cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's two major divisions,
that peripheral, the ganglion,
[SPEAKER_00]: and those nerves, the brain, and the
spinal cord is part of the central.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to quiz you on all the very
specific nerve here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how many and how complex that
they are because it's responsible for this
[SPEAKER_00]: network for sensing both exterior and
interior senses for the entire body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that nervous system, those receptors
and motor effectors in all vertebrae,
[SPEAKER_00]: in most invertebrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So focusing first on the central nervous
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it's this association of neurons
and they're located in the brain and
[SPEAKER_00]: spinal cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in kind of orange here is
representative of our central nervous
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The peripheral nervous system is a little
bit more complex in the sense that it
[SPEAKER_00]: contains motor or efferent neurons and
they can carry impulses away in the
[SPEAKER_00]: central nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So away from the central nervous system,
this is like motor reflexes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that attach to the muscles and our
brain says move the muscle, it's these
[SPEAKER_00]: efferent or motor neurons that are
carrying that message.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, we have sensory or
efferent neurons and they carry impulses
[SPEAKER_00]: to the central nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're kind of the sensory receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the stove is hot, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sense is being sent to the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is an efferent or sensory system
being processed in the brain and then
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately leaving the brain is a sense of
a motor neuron to help move the hand away
[SPEAKER_00]: from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these neurons that I speak of,
they're microscopic nerve cells that make
[SPEAKER_00]: up the brain spinal cord and nerves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to give you an idea of their size,
about 30,000 can fit on a pinhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a neuron and the nerve impulse
moves one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The direction the message will travel is
from the dendrites to the axon terminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gonna move this direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we see here in our arrow,
the direction of the message will be
[SPEAKER_00]: received in the dendrites, sent to the
cell body, down here to ultimately the
[SPEAKER_00]: axon terminal at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the only way that the nerve
impulses will be able to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: That message will travel in this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that peripheral nervous system sends
information to the central nervous system
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing sensory neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see here that they're connected
in different parts of the spinal cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why the higher up on the spinal
cord that damage may occur, the more
[SPEAKER_00]: organs it can potentially affect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we have high injury, for example,
C1 and C4 injuries on our spinal cord,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can ultimately injure and impact even
normal breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the lungs can be impacted by this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at the same terminology,
cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same terminology used for the
skeletal system when we're defining the
[SPEAKER_00]: vertebral column here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So peripheral nerves for a particular
region of the body feed into the spinal
[SPEAKER_00]: cord at a particular site.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why if we can determine where
certain pain is, very important,
[SPEAKER_00]: or car accident or injuries, where damage
in the spinal cord may occur, that could
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately relate to the organs that may
be affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, within this peripheral nervous
system, our nerves are visible bundles of
[SPEAKER_00]: axons and dendrites that extend from the
brain to the spinal cord and to all parts
[SPEAKER_00]: of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I just included an image here
of some cranial nerves and olfactoris
[SPEAKER_00]: relating to smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a motor and our sensory
nerves ultimately located here also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's kind of giving you that more
complex area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see here our radial or ulna,
if you remember, from skeletal system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our radius and our ulna.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are also following a very similar
name, so we know in general where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: located.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the responsibilities of our
peripheral nervous system is those sensory
[SPEAKER_00]: nerves carry the messages from the body to
the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pain, pressure, or temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going from here, we're sensing,
going to the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that indicated by this kind of blue
line located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, we have our motor
nerves which carry messages from the brain
[SPEAKER_00]: to the body to actually respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have someone touching a candle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the sense of this is hot in high
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could do damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to the spinal cord, the brain,
the brain is interpreting that as danger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's then going to send a signal to the
motor neuron here to the muscle to say
[SPEAKER_00]: move the hand and ultimately that hand
will move away from the heat source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of putting that also into a kind of
image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our afferent impulses that sensory
going to the spinal cord and our afferent
[SPEAKER_00]: here coming out of the spinal cord
attaching to the actual muscles resulting
[SPEAKER_00]: in the movement of a finger here or a
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you that idea of how this
kind of system works of we're having a
[SPEAKER_00]: sensory impulse and some of this is
controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have those kind of reflexes that may
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is occurring through the peripheral
nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's occurring both ourselves and sensory
and motor nerves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
