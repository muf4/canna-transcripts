[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this DeBacco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be looking at sexing
cannabis seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you grow plants from seeds that are
dioecious where they could be male or
[SPEAKER_00]: female.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you determine whether you have a
male plant or a female plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of times I could determine
if you're looking for cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you want to keep that plant or
discard that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here follow along with this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into some of the
methods here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, there are two main options.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, there's gender detection screening
using the PCR method or polymerase chain
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction method, or there's the quick
clone and flip method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both of these had advantages and
disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to cover both of these here
briefly, giving you the pros and cons,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you can make a decision on which
one you think is the best fit for your
[SPEAKER_00]: growing environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, using the gender detection
screening or PCR method, the advantage of
[SPEAKER_00]: this method is very accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also offers very quick results and can
be done early in plant development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're actually looking at screening
some of the genetics of that plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine where it's male or female.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be done basically at the very early
seedling stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a lot of advantages with this
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why everyone does not use this
method is simply because of some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: key disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first being, of course, that it is
costly for the equipment to use to set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be kind of a lot of equipment
that's needed, a lot of upfront cost
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also requires individually testing each
plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So organization and labeling are also very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say organization, we're looking
at using these very small PCR tubes to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to analyze the samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: The specialized equipment is needed or
material needs to be sent off to site to a
[SPEAKER_00]: lab, which again, might be pretty
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibitive for certain growing
establishments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the other method,
the clone and flip method, the advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: to this one and a big advantage,
that's very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The results are clear and distinctive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Female clones could be provided an early
indication of chemical end products to be
[SPEAKER_00]: produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this simply involves is taking
vegetative cuttings from a plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: putting them into a cloner, typically
taking up a small space and putting them
[SPEAKER_00]: under a flowering light period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can induce flowering at a very
early age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can determine whether you have a
male or female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a female, you could keep it going
for a little bit longer and maybe get some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of idea of the chemical end products
for that clone that it matches,
[SPEAKER_00]: that mother or stock plant that it
matches.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are also some disadvantage
with this method, as it cannot be done
[SPEAKER_00]: with autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this does require labeling and a
dedicated space for a 12 hours light,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 hours dark photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does take much longer to get
results than with the PCR method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, each has its pros and cons,
its advantages and disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might want to review these and then
check out this channel for continuing
[SPEAKER_00]: videos going into details on whatever step
or process you think is the best fit for
[SPEAKER_00]: your growing establishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
