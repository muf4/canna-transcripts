[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to go over some farm
equipment, general farm toys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not always are they things that are
powered and big tractors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be a simple wheelbarrow or a
shovel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to know who your true friends
are, show them a shovel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going over just general equipment and
what we may need on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first step is appreciate what you
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be easier said than done,
but the basics of what you need in part
[SPEAKER_00]: depends on what you already have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether it's a small rider mower,
small tractor, or a larger tractor,
[SPEAKER_00]: even just a walk behind tiller,
appreciate what you have because what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to need or what you think you
might need is going to depend on what
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment you already have and what your
setup is and how large or small your
[SPEAKER_00]: operation may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So needs and wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need it or do you want it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We all look and see the shows,
that nice shiny new tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be, is that more of a need or is
that really a want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the old similar for Apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want maybe a new computer,
but we all need the actual food and
[SPEAKER_00]: substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally being happy is right between the
needs and the wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be very hard to decipher in
some cases, but sometimes take a step back
[SPEAKER_00]: and really look at the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So items worth consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of the farms I've visited and been to,
and even my own little operation here,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's worth serious consideration?
[SPEAKER_00]: What should you really look at potentially
getting?
[SPEAKER_00]: And these three things kind of keep coming
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insect netting, a mist blower,
and drip irrigation with an injector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of shows basically this is
insect netting, a mist blower,
[SPEAKER_00]: and drip irrigation with an injector.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't show the injector here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why are these things important?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the insect netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, insect netting is going to be the
wave of the future from what it seems
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insect pressure is constantly increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only item for insects that has
100% efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, assuming it's installed properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that we're protecting
our crop and especially with those trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to be organic and not wanting to,
or having very limited applications of
[SPEAKER_00]: products that they can apply, a physical
barrier is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even for some chemical guys, the spraying
of insecticides does work on occasion,
[SPEAKER_00]: but nothing beats insect netting for that
true physical barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, there are some things that
come with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the make sure it's installed
properly, but it does offer 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: effectiveness if it is properly installed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's different mesh sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all insect netting is not the same to
include certain insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the larger the insect, the bigger
the mesh size you can get away with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finer mesh should be advised to protect
against aphids or other small insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some aphids, even down the like
little thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, larger mesh is typically
less expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not always, but typically less expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used for like squash bugs on
cucurbits that transmit yellow vine
[SPEAKER_00]: decline, becoming a major issue in our
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collared potato beetle, bigger insects,
bigger mesh, typically less cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids very small to require smaller mesh
size and typically more expensive with
[SPEAKER_00]: insect netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So insect netting, more than just a crop
cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highly recommend to be installed on all
season extenders, such as high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not make a hinge door as it can be left
open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your high tunnel structures,
if you have roll-up sides, they're great
[SPEAKER_00]: for airflow, but you may want to be lining
that with insect netting to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: insects from getting established there
early in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're, again, starting in that April
or even March timeframe, you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent your insects from getting built up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I say don't put a hinge
door is if you walk in, you might close
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but if someone else walks in,
they may leave it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaving it open can allow some insects to
escape in and then they're trapped in a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice perfect environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having doors may have like, screens have
like magnets that keep coming through and
[SPEAKER_00]: they reattach.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can also be great when you walk
through and you snap them right back
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that just have a pipe down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you gotta pick the pipe up to walk in
and drop it right down immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're kind of eliminating the chance
of insects kind of sneaking in,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still allow you access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physical barrier, this isn't a new idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like everyone's like,
oh, insect netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been used for bird netting from
grapes to keep birds out of grape
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same concept, again, different best size,
of course, but same basic concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: That physical barrier providing that
separation between the crop and the pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mistblower is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mistblower can allow for efficient
nutrient applications, produces very small
[SPEAKER_00]: droplets of fine mist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a backpack leaf blower with
a water tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to get the droplets very
small, a very high surface area,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can allow them to be spread out more
efficiently on the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mistblower saves time, quick coverage,
can provide better coverage over
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional hand pump sprayers,
and it can get the top and the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also means you don't have to be right
there at the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can spread pretty far distance and
still be able to get efficient coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mistblower allows you to do less product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cost savings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine's actually paid for itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are expensive, but with the product
that I've used a lot less of, I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: able to save costs that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to mention the time and labor savings
that I've had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by simply pulling the truck next to the
area, going through and spraying,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using less product, doing it in less
time, and to me now it's completely paid
[SPEAKER_00]: for itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still works just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mistblowers can have a way they call it
the lobster arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are fiddler crab here, where you're
constantly one hands, always all season
[SPEAKER_00]: pumping the pump sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mistblower is gas powered,
makes it really easy and efficient to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and start it up and walk down the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steel makes two models here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall though is they can be heavy,
but there's two different size options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the four gallon is here, it weighs 28
pounds, empty, and water again about eight
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds a gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do the math there, adds up really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have a small two gallon one,
it's only 17 pounds, again empty,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you only fit two gallons in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's less weight in that regards.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is basically Steel's weed whacker
motor, and this is their true leaf blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used them both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say that they both perform,
and they both do the same function.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the four gallon one, it is a much
bigger motor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically run this one at idle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one you have to use the throttle a
little bit, but it's more than capable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're someone, it's a little bit
something lighter on their back,
[SPEAKER_00]: this would be a great option to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I think most farms should
seriously consider is drip irrigation and
[SPEAKER_00]: an injector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So drip tapes allow efficient watering,
low evaporation percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the injector indicated here,
allows for precise nutrient application,
[SPEAKER_00]: which allows you to put stuff in the pail
here, and it's injected right through to
[SPEAKER_00]: the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do require some filters, maybe some
pressure gait, some extra plumbing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's well worth it in season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drip tapes come in different thicknesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you sterilize your rows, the thicker
can be more cost effective, because you
[SPEAKER_00]: can use it multiple years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the six mil, which is basically
one season use, usually used under
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight mil, commonly used for vegetable
crops, again about one season use,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a little rougher and tougher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten mil can be used in heavy rock areas,
or overwintering something like a
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the 15 mil allows multiple years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say I've used the 15, I'm using
some on my sixth year, and it's working
[SPEAKER_00]: out just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have to take care of it and pull it
out of the fields for the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of a laborer in that
sense, but using it year after year makes
[SPEAKER_00]: it so much easier than having to make all
the irrigation lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drip tapes, their flow rates and emitter
spacings are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can determine the amount of feed of
tape you could run at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: This takes a little math calculations,
I'm not going to bore you with a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: math, but basically you can adjust the
tapes or flow rate to match the gallons
[SPEAKER_00]: per minute your equipment can supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a lot of water, you can dump
a lot of water, irrigate a large field,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you might have a slower kind of flow,
and you just have to irrigate less at one
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just takes a little math calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave you some examples here,
I'm not going to bore you with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: details, but the key part is, here if
you're assuming we have a consistent seven
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons per minute, which is on the low
end, the amount of water you want to add
[SPEAKER_00]: per crop is 400 gallons, your total roll
feed is 1500 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in this case, if you got the low
flow, you could run 3000 feet of drip tape
[SPEAKER_00]: at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get the higher flow, you can only
run 1500 drip tapes at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one you'd have to run twice as long,
two hours, because it flows less.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one you can run for less time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, depends on the pump and the
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of companies are very willing to
help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while the math may look scary
initially, once you kind of dive into the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers, you can always pause the video
and look at it in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really not that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: The injector, this is Dosatron,
this is a brand name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows for precise amount of liquid to
be fertilized to the irrigation at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the ones you might hear off
they're running, they kind of click,
[SPEAKER_00]: click, click, click, click, click,
click sound as they're going through and
[SPEAKER_00]: injecting the fertilizer as the water
flows by.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, valves here,
this one's not running or operational,
[SPEAKER_00]: the valves are closed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't always have to run it through
here, but it gives you that option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Injectors, they can be used when needed,
they can move to different zones,
[SPEAKER_00]: they make little carts, and it can provide
a quick fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a situation where you notice
a crop's going a little deficient in
[SPEAKER_00]: something, you can wheel this over,
hook it up to the irrigation line and go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and fertilize the crop,
just what it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazee injector, this less expensive
alternative to the Dosatron type
[SPEAKER_00]: injectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no wooden carts, they work with
the Venturi effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're familiar with carburetors,
if you have an old tractor or an older
[SPEAKER_00]: car, they have their issues, but the
Venturi is basically what's going on with
[SPEAKER_00]: the carburetor.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of the Amazee injector here,
you can see it's set up very similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: the other one, there's a timer and a
filter, I should say, and the fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: injector.
[SPEAKER_00]: These do tend to lose some pressure
because they're working on the Venturi
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, which is passing liquid through a
smaller area, causing it to move faster,
[SPEAKER_00]: changing pressures, allowing it to soak up
the fertilizer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do lose some pressure overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just again, something to keep in mind
for your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, just because you can inject
fertilizer doesn't mean you should always
[SPEAKER_00]: be doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus on a few key elements to liquid
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your soil should do the main feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fertilizer stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grower, the farmer who buys the entire
cart of every different type of nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: because they got this fancy new injector
and they're spending all this money
[SPEAKER_00]: injecting fertilizers because they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus on a few, your soil should really be
prepped and you shouldn't really be going
[SPEAKER_00]: through and having to fertilize with a ton
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen's a key one, sometimes potassium
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wish lists for farm equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different for each individual,
unique farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has different wish lists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some can give smaller items, larger items,
but everyone I know has a wish list.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tried and true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old is not necessarily outdated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Antique tractors still around for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're overbuilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a new to me John Deere M that I
bought in 1949.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just bought it, just kind of fixed it up a
little bit, ran through, runs just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two cylinders, Johnny Popper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does the job just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: No issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because it's old doesn't mean it's
outdated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't always think you need the brand
new, latest and greatest computer
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a very, very simple thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also some tools out there that one
does it all, kind of the Swiss Army knife
[SPEAKER_00]: approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: The BCS, Detroit Built Flex is kind of a
new one on the market here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lack specialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: If an engine goes down though,
everything will stop and you can only do
[SPEAKER_00]: one task at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because one power base can go
through and be a blower, be a snow blower,
[SPEAKER_00]: be a mower, be an air compressor,
you can only do one of those at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this does fail, all your
attachments simply don't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just another reason for concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the advantage is you only have one
thing to keep and maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that does make it a lot easier that
typically you're not mowing the lawn and
[SPEAKER_00]: snow blowing at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're only using those one at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take care of that piece of equipment
and it can last you a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specialized equipment can allow for quick
transitions, be efficient, use a plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch layer, use a potato digger,
use a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specialized equipment, you know,
when you get into certain things,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may, if you're spending a lot of time
doing that, you may want to, can justify
[SPEAKER_00]: in that case, going through and
researching and buying that one species of
[SPEAKER_00]: specialized equipment that you may only
use one or two times a year, but if it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it better overall for you,
then that's worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, equipment's a prime example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have all these different mower,
the tedding, the rake, the baler,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these different specialized pieces of
equipment that are all needed to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: those nice little square or those large
round bales needed for animal feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also want to make comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get locked into one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of farmers think, oh, it's a farm,
I need a tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in some cases, a skid steer might be
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some, just weighing some of the
pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see here, pros to tractors,
good for row crops, long and high
[SPEAKER_00]: designed, designed mainly for farming,
not easily maneuverable in tight spaces
[SPEAKER_00]: though, limiting on their lifting power.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something of concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skid steer, very maneuverable,
high lift height, good weight capacity,
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple attachment options, but they have
very low ground clearance and only front
[SPEAKER_00]: end attachments.
[SPEAKER_00]: No kind of three point hitch on the back
or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, pros and cons to everything,
weigh both sides, talk with others,
[SPEAKER_00]: see what they're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preventive maintenance is another
important aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole different kind of lecture
and presentation on maintenance,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is often I find overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it gets busy in season,
checking the oil is important,
[SPEAKER_00]: checking tires for weathering and grease
fittings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stress that one enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing where they are, knowing what
grease it's filled with, having a grease
[SPEAKER_00]: gun, knowing where that's located,
just that preventive maintenance,
[SPEAKER_00]: that quick kind of coolant check,
tire pressure check can really save you a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of time being down in season when
you're really need a piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just good to check oil, make sure it's
in the low to full ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it burning oil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it clean oil?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have a tire go down and
grease fittings, you want to be burning
[SPEAKER_00]: out fittings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick little maintenance can really save
you a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly for equipment, I want you to
think about hand tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to think that every farm needs
to have a giant tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not underestimate the need for simple
hand tools and the variety of hand tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: A sigh, I can't, I'm amazed that how many
people don't have one or know even what
[SPEAKER_00]: one is or have never even used one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a weed whacker go down at one of
the jobs I had previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a sigh sitting on the barn door
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how no one's ever touched it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grabbed it and cleaned up the area
we need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little getting used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be careful with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a long blade, but they can be very
efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your loppers, your pruning shears,
your different types of shovels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's got their favorite shovel,
different lengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't underestimate the need and the
efficiency that hand tools can offer in
[SPEAKER_00]: certain instances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always have plenty on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them hanged up so you don't lose them
or forget them in the field because you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to leave one in the field and
run it over with something and pop a tire
[SPEAKER_00]: or have other issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hand tools for especially smaller
operations have a wide variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them organized and they can make your
job a lot easier.
Thank you.
