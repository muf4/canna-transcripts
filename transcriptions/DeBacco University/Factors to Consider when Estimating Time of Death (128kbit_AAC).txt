[SPEAKER_00]: So here in this Debaco University video,
we're going to be looking at factors to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider when estimating the time of
death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to look at some of the
digestive systems, some blood pooling to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are different factors,
while not a complete list, some key
[SPEAKER_00]: factors to consider when estimating the
time of death.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the digestive contents.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to keep in mind that these can
help determine the time of death by
[SPEAKER_00]: determining how long the person was until
they ate, until they died.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seconds, it only takes seconds for
chewed food to pass through the esophagus
[SPEAKER_00]: down to the stomach, four to six hours for
the stomach to empty its contents into the
[SPEAKER_00]: small intestine, about 12 hours for the
food to leave the small intestine,
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours until undigested food is released
from the large intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this digestive process usually takes a
bit more time than a day, but it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: affected by sickness, liquid intake,
fear, and also any drugs the person may
[SPEAKER_00]: have consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to keep in mind of these
potential variables to the time that's
[SPEAKER_00]: stated here when we're trying to look at
the digestive contents of an individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at the eyes is another
indicator that can be used because the
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes of the victim can also hold answers
to the time of death.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a thin, cloudy film that will
develop over the eye within about two to
[SPEAKER_00]: three hours after death has occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the eyes are closed though,
this will take about 24 hours for this
[SPEAKER_00]: film to appear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind is how the person was
found originally can influence,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, these times that are stated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The eyeballs become softer as a result of
less fluid pressure behind the eye and the
[SPEAKER_00]: degree to which this has occurred can be
used as a measure of the time since death
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind I have a couple little chart
here kind of looking at open versus closed
[SPEAKER_00]: and the onset just to give an
approximation for trying to pinpoint
[SPEAKER_00]: within degrees accuracy we can to estimate
that time of death.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have skin coloration to take into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the color of the corpse will help
determine the time of death from about 48
[SPEAKER_00]: hours onward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not great determining under two days,
but beyond two days this has a stronger
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: From approximately 40 hours after death
bacteria begin to breed in the skin giving
[SPEAKER_00]: the skin a noticeably green tone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tinge will start in the lower stomach
area and spread outwards affecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: hands and feet last.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can also give an idea of where
that progression was found or discovered
[SPEAKER_00]: on the individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Approximately four to seven days after
death the skin will acquire this
[SPEAKER_00]: marble-like appearance and this veins
become closer to the surface thus becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: more easily visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again skin coloration another factor to
try to estimate that time of death.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have blood pooling as we can see
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pooling of blood can be a vital clue
in determining the time of death and is
[SPEAKER_00]: known as hypostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This occurs when the blood ceases flowing
selling the lowest parts of the body and
[SPEAKER_00]: in turn causes the skin to become pink and
red in color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blood will pool at the lowest parts of the
body usually starting between six to eight
[SPEAKER_00]: hours after death has occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Analyzing the location of the pooling can
help indicate the position of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also if we find that region and we kind of
apply some pressure depending whether the
[SPEAKER_00]: coloration changes or not or how quick it
returns can also help indicate an estimate
[SPEAKER_00]: for time of death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in the upper image see the blood
pooling in the back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person is left in what's called the
supine position there on their back and
[SPEAKER_00]: that blood pooling indicates that that is
the position they were in when they died.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these are contributing factors to
help pinpoint when the time of death had
[SPEAKER_00]: originally occurred.
Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
