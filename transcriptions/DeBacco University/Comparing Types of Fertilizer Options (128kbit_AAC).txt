[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
we're going to go an in-depth look at
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing types of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into comparing types of
fertilizer options for growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, with fertilizer,
we have what's called a guaranteed
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all fertilizer labels have three
distinctive numbers displayed,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the guaranteed analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These numbers represent the primary
nutrients and are presented in this
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see nitrogen, followed by
phosphorus, followed by potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, this fertilizer has no
phosphorus, but is still listed as a
[SPEAKER_00]: number.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows nutrient ratios to be compared
of any fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, the forms of each that the
plant can uptake can be listed as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: First number is the amount of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second number is the amount of phosphate
in the form of P2O5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to get the actual amount of
phosphorus, you take the P2O5 and multiply
[SPEAKER_00]: it by 0.044 to get the P. And the third
number is potash, K2O, to get the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: number of just potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take K2O and multiply it by 0.83.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, because growers are typically
looking at what's plant available,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is why they're presented in these
forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll also notice the guaranteed analysis
down here lists water soluble nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: with water in soluble nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that 4% of water in soluble nitrogen
is slowly available nitrogen and is
[SPEAKER_00]: derived in this example from biosolids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what if there's a fourth number?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you kind of see the three numbers
and then there's a fourth number?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the fourth number may appear in some
specialty fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will usually represent either iron or
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure to check the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're looking at kind of
this multi nutrient blend here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These nutrients are supplemental and may
be a value under special conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why there's typically only
those three numbers kind of listed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those specialty fertilizers, now we're
looking at fertilizers, can contain only
[SPEAKER_00]: one of three primary nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example, we have nitrogen sources
such as ammonium nitrate, which is 35.5%
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen with no phosphorus or potassium,
urea, sodium nitrate, or liquid nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these are very much favoring the
nitrogen with no phosphorus or potassium,
[SPEAKER_00]: which in certain cases might be
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a phosphorus source,
typically super triple phos, zero 46 zero,
[SPEAKER_00]: a very potent source of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then potash or potassium sources here,
potassium chlorine, potassium sulfate,
[SPEAKER_00]: 60% and 50% potassium respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get into some blending
fertilizers, this Jaxx Professional 2020,
[SPEAKER_00]: an even blend of nitrogen, phosphorus,
and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get into those water soluble and
insoluble forms here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So labels will often state how much of the
nitrogen is either water and soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is slowly released over a long
period of time, typically several weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: months, or even potentially years,
as opposed to quickly available water
[SPEAKER_00]: soluble nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that listed right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, fertilizers will contain a
combination of both forms, because if it
[SPEAKER_00]: all contained one, it'd either be waiting
a really long time, or it'd all be
[SPEAKER_00]: available in a very short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quickly available water soluble forms
allows for quick results, only days,
[SPEAKER_00]: about three days after application,
you can see a change in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Word of caution with the water soluble
forms, as these have higher odds of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: damage if applied too concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, the slower released forms
often have a coating or other mechanisms
[SPEAKER_00]: to allow that slow release to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often these forms have additional
expense associated with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, here's just another example of
a label, we're focusing on nitrogen of
[SPEAKER_00]: course, but we see there's other nutrients
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, there's also other non plant
food ingredients included, as well as some
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there's a lot that can be
gleaned for information from the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this fertilizer ratio, again,
things are still in the same nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus, and potassium form.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ratio of fertilizers is the
relationship between nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus, potassium content in those
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ratio basics, a fertilizer with a
3-1-2 ratio contains more than half the
[SPEAKER_00]: times as much nitrogen as it does
potassium, and three times more nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: than phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of gives you that ratio there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilizer example, fertilizer grades of
45, 15, 30 have a 3-1-2 ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are important potentially for
different stages of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrient concentrations are pound for
pound, a 36, 12, 24 fertilizer contains
[SPEAKER_00]: twice as much nutrients as an 8,
6, 12 fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind as well when you're
looking at your application rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see some grades and some ratios as
some examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nitrogen is typically kind of meant to
be for greening up the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these are just general examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus, we think kind of down in the
sense of the roots and blooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: and potassium present kind of all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the up-down, all-around nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium kind of lingo there
[SPEAKER_00]: just to get you an idea of what generally
each can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how much is in the bag of fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fertilizer ratios does not usually
reflect the elemental nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus, and potassium, as I mentioned
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only N in nitrogen is expressed as the
elemental basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: P and K are expressed as the oxidized
basic compounds because those are the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant-available ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that a fertilizer that reads
18, 6, 12, as we see right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: 18, 6, 12, this contains 18% nitrogen,
6% phosphorus, and 12% potassium as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: plant-available concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you purchase a 100-pound bag of
this, it would be 18 pounds nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: 6 pounds, and 12 pounds respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you purchase a 20-pound bag,
that would have 3.6 pounds nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.2 pounds phosphorus, 2.4 potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see how those ratios play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be important when you
look at your application rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at solid fertilizer,
we see here a granular form, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's known for good handling properties
and allow even distribution because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like little pebbles or rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This form does not cake or form fine dust,
which can make applications challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this makes typically easier form to
apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blended fertilizers we see down here is a
result of a combination of single element
[SPEAKER_00]: or compound fertilizers to achieve a
certain ratio or blend that's created to
[SPEAKER_00]: match the results of a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some fertilizer companies will make a
blend if you give them soil test results.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this can cause there to be a size
and color differences between the
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of fertilizer,
which can sometimes lead to uneven
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one particle is really big and one
particle is really small, that can lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: uneven applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fertilizer does help ensure that
resulting field is fertilizer with
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients that's needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the ratios based on the soil test,
it reduces the potential for over
[SPEAKER_00]: application of one nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's better than just applying one
single nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need a custom blend, all the
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also liquid fertilizers and
there's clear solutions which have
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients that are completely dissolved in
water to make handling very easy for the
[SPEAKER_00]: applicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, these are only available in
relatively low concentrated nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is suspension fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are basically nutrient suspensions
and solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have higher nutrient concentrations
and can be used as a regular fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, these types of fertilizer require
repeated applications both while in
[SPEAKER_00]: storage and even during applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need kind of that agitation so they
don't usually settle at the bottom because
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to ensure you're getting an even
application of your fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's also gaseous forms of
fertilizer used only in limited
[SPEAKER_00]: applications due to special handling and
safety precautions that are needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anhydrous ammonia is a great nitrogen
fertilizer and is a common gaseous form of
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, to be effective, it must be
injected into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that soil has limited rocks to
prevent the gas from escaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put that, injecting that nitrogen
down below the soil surface, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: if there's a lot of rocks, those tips are
basically going to get broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why you can only apply an area
with limited rocks because it wants to be
[SPEAKER_00]: covered up and sealed so it's kept in the
root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hazards involved in handling of anhydrous
ammonia include the kind of serious
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for chemical burns and
asphyxiation as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, be cautious with this type of
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's organic material
considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often these have variable properties,
so each must be evaluated independently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Key properties to consider with any
fertilizer, particularly organics,
[SPEAKER_00]: is solubility, meaning how well do the
nutrients dissolve in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish fertilizer, for example, can be kind
of hard or very low solubility,
[SPEAKER_00]: can be hard to get into solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a particle size.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can relate to simply the application
method, but also the speed of application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you just pay more for that finer
grounding, but it will be more plant
[SPEAKER_00]: available faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we want to consider also soluble
salts, and this pertains to organic as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as inorganic forms of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: High salts can cause damage to plants,
but if fertilizer applications are evenly
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed and amounts follow the
guidance of a soil test, the odds are low
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, concentrated applications plants
near germinating seeds can increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: odds of damage, especially if applied in a
band or line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see example of the seeds being
planted here and here, and we're banding
[SPEAKER_00]: that fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting it about five and a half
inches away from the plant's seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 inches is our row spacing, so those
roots can kind of grow out to that
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can happen with organic fertilizer
such as manure in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will broadcast their
fertilizers, some will sub-soil bandwidth,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning they put the seed here and they
put the band of fertilizer below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others will go kind of put the seed here
and put the fertilizer over on this side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those roots will grow out and when
they're more developed and ready to uptake
[SPEAKER_00]: those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called banding fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically with soluble salts, if you put
it right next to the seed, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: burn that seed or that tender root when it
initially germinates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at that salt,
we want to consider the salt index.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to know the salt index of the
fertilizer you're intending on using.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see some have very low salt
index, some have very high salt index.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean that you didn't stay away
from those that have high salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be aware because that's going to
maybe affect how you apply it or how much
[SPEAKER_00]: you apply it to limit the chance of plant
damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we have fertilizer grades here and
this is when we're looking at purchasing
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manufacturers produce different grades of
many fertilizers for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the granular, which is often the
largest for field applications due to
[SPEAKER_00]: typically the lowest cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to the particle size will be the
largest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And technically the most variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, it's about 22 millimeters just
to give you an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the mini granular,
which is highly uniform, medium sized
[SPEAKER_00]: particles about 14 millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greens grade is micro size particles
commonly used in greens and golf courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very finely ground about nine millimeters
in particle size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically you're going to pay the most for
the greens grade, even though it might be
[SPEAKER_00]: the exact same fertilizer that you can get
in the granular form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also soluble quickly dissolves in
liquid fertilizer solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's like a wettable powder so
you can then mix and go through and
[SPEAKER_00]: rapidly apply and be very quickly
available to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while these might be of the same
fertilizer, the different grade of
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer can impact the cost,
the method of application, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: availability to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you enjoyed this kind of very
detailed look at fertilizer options so
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd be well educated and make an
informed decision to the benefit of you
[SPEAKER_00]: and your plants.
