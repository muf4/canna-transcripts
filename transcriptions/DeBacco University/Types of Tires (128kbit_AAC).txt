[SPEAKER_00]: So this video lecture was going to go over
some basic classifications or types of
[SPEAKER_00]: tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of information contained on
all of the slides, so be sure to pause it
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to learn more specifically
about each tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to give you a brief
overview here in the video lecture for the
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, probably the most obvious,
we have your passenger or all-season
[SPEAKER_00]: tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have those longer treadwear,
good ride, reasonable traction,
[SPEAKER_00]: your common one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you're most likely to see because
they can be used year round or all season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on from a passenger or all-season
tire, we can have winter tires,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in areas that tend to get a
lot of snow or winter weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is designed for maximum traction and
snow, kind of slushy ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the different tread
pattern over here, located here on what's
[SPEAKER_00]: defined as a winter tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're typically not used all season
because they tend to be a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And better able to handle the winter type
weather, but maybe not necessarily as good
[SPEAKER_00]: in other kind of conditions found during
the summer and spring and fall months.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have all-terrain or mud tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what you're noticing here is they're
really focused on kind of off-road
[SPEAKER_00]: traction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have really large kind of deep
treads, large knobs on the tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're great for being off-road in mud
where you need a lot of that kind of grip
[SPEAKER_00]: and traction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they really don't perform great
on-road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their wear life on asphalt is probably
not the greatest either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these are a little bit more
specialized for being off-road in this
[SPEAKER_00]: example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also typically oversized as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have drag racing radial tires or
DOT legal tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are tires that their goal is to
maximize acceleration and to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow a lot of contact with the road
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've designed kind of for drag racing,
a lot of traction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that tread compared to our
mud tires, much reduced, a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: surface contact on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now again, these probably would not be the
best to be using in any sort of wet or
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of wintery conditions, but they are
considered DOT legal, meaning they do have
[SPEAKER_00]: the depth required to technically be used
on DOT roads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in comparison to those, we have Racing
Slicks, which their goal is really to
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize the surface contact that they
have with the road surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, Racing Slicks or True Racing
Slicks are never intended to be driven on
[SPEAKER_00]: the street or exposed in near freezing
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have very minimal area here where any
water could be sheeted off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have absolutely the maximum amount of
contact, therefore used in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: racetracks and autocross only special use
tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have something called trailer tires,
which on a quick look may look very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to an all-terrain tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're specifically built for
stability, durability and payloads or not
[SPEAKER_00]: for powered vehicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're simply for to be put towed behind
on a trailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking at investigating a
crime scene that has multiple tire tracks
[SPEAKER_00]: and there was potentially a trailer
involved in some way, towing something,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are going to have a slightly
different tread pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to be something to
investigate and to be able to section out
[SPEAKER_00]: from the towing vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a temporary spare tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one that's, there can be full
size spares, there can be half spares or
[SPEAKER_00]: part spares.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, differs by manufacturer,
but these are simply light duty,
[SPEAKER_00]: special purpose, temporary use tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not something you're typically going to
see unless a vehicle involved in the crime
[SPEAKER_00]: scene did have a flat and you'd have to
change it and they'd have to put on a
[SPEAKER_00]: spare tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just another different way or
different tread pattern, different tread
[SPEAKER_00]: tire type to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching and have a great day.
