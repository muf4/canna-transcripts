[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over some
common organic fertilizers that are used
[SPEAKER_00]: by many growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, you might see these as
ingredients in super soil or things that
[SPEAKER_00]: people add to different mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just some common ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want you to realize that this is not
a complete list.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, I provide the nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium, the NPK fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just simply provided as a guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different manufacturers, different blends
may have slightly different numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's included will be some of the common
products used by growers, and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide you with the main source,
meaning where it comes from, the
[SPEAKER_00]: availability to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: How quick does the plant have access to
those nutrients, what it's used for,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also any particular keynotes I feel
you should need to know about that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the first one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very broad-based, let's go with manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the source is animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it depends on what animal,
using horse or cow or llama or rabbit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different types of sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, availability can be impacted
by the type of bedding used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see manure for sale here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all well and good.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we want to look at the bedding
that's used.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it looks like a lot of no
hay or straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it sawdust?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it no bedding?
[SPEAKER_00]: That can affect the availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sawdust would be the least advantageous
because that will absorb a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen as it goes to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uses of manures of common soil additives
should be properly composted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be cautious of potential weed seeds,
especially if you're getting horse manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chicken manure is considered to be the
most potent, can also be the most
[SPEAKER_00]: strongest odor or smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know the source of your
manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, watch the phosphorus and do not
reach excessive conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should be taking a soil sample and
knowing approximately how much to add
[SPEAKER_00]: without increasing your phosphorus to
toxic or above optimum conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually plant-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's moderately available to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very common soil amendment to
increase water retention and deliver a
[SPEAKER_00]: broad base of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you want to know the source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it composed mainly of leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that compost?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it mushroom compost?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a combination of what type of
leaves, a combination of sticks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, all that can impact things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can over-add and create water issues
and high nutrient levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can actually hurt plant yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's just, oh, it's compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can keep adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decomposed leaves are a good base to start
with because sometimes compost could
[SPEAKER_00]: contain manure-based things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, you want to have that more
leaf-based and just, again, watch the
[SPEAKER_00]: water retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: The alfalfa meal is from the alfalfa
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very slow to be available to the
plant to access.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used also as animal feed for the
protein or as a soil amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pellets form is really great to apply,
but this can be slower to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be a supplement and not a main
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're adding alfalfa meal for the
nitrogen, plant may not give quick enough
[SPEAKER_00]: access to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, keep in mind pellets, while they
might be easy to apply, can be slower to
[SPEAKER_00]: break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bat guano is a source of caves,
or it's basically bat manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be very rapidly accessible,
especially for a nitrogen source,
[SPEAKER_00]: which it's commonly used for.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it can be used for nitrogen,
don't forget about the other nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: you're adding, particularly phosphorus and
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to also consider the
sustainability and the shipping expense of
[SPEAKER_00]: where that manure may actually be coming
from, what country or what region of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seabird guano, kind of very similar to bat
guano, it's seabird manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can kind of see right here,
fresh seabird manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quickly available, and it's used as a
nitrogen and phosphorus source.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here, a little bit bigger numbers,
at least in this instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we want to keep a balance,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it provides some of the major
nutrients, which is great, but be careful
[SPEAKER_00]: of the ratios, because if you're applying
for the nitrogen content, most likely
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be over adding the phosphorus to
your particular growing medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just be mindful of some of the
contents that the seabird guano does have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bone meal, main source is bones from the
slaughter industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very slow to kind of moderate
release.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does increase phosphorus, we see there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure the pH is under seven to keep the
availability of phosphorus higher if you
[SPEAKER_00]: are showing an issue with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it can be slow acting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a while to break down,
so it's not a good quick fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting later in the season and
you're noticing phosphorus issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: adding bone meal may not be your best
source for the availability aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's blood meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slaughter industry, again, it's a rapid
source, and it uses this for nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: 12-0-0.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very quick acting, meaning if you
apply it today, three days after
[SPEAKER_00]: application, you should see a difference
in your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost a pure source of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it is expensive compared to other
chemical forms of nitrogen, and is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: this blackish kind of color there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not the typical red that you would
associate with blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is this kind of dark red, almost
blackish coloration most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish meal is dried fish waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quickly available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nitrogen source with some other
nutrients and also amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful because it can be very
difficult to mix with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically you may want to use warm
water and take some time to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: this does integrate and mix well with the
water before you go to apply in kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: pockets of very concentrated mix and then
very dilute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish emulsion is gutted fish waste,
also quickly available, a nitrogen source
[SPEAKER_00]: with some other nutrients and also amino
acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I say the ratios here provided as a
suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this Neptune's harvest,
I believe that's 2, 4, 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just watch the particular
manufacturer you choose to buy from.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very common form of fish
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does typically have a stabilizer added
to it, which commonly is an acid to help
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the time to be able to use it
before it may spoil or go rancid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that pH might be a little
bit lower if you are hopefully testing the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seaweed, also called kelp, it usually
comes from cold water kelp, moderately
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a general soil conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be applied to the leaves in
some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does contain micronutrients and plant
hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It commonly is at the seedling stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it favors potassium in
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very dilute products, so not one to rely
on to support the nutrient needs of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be adding seaweed for its
nitrogen source, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: While those have many other good
properties, it's not going to be like a
[SPEAKER_00]: main feed, especially if you're looking at
deficiency symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have greensand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mined from the ocean floor,
commonly off the coast of New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a slow release, and it has potassium
and some other micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to the slow availability, it doesn't
mean you can count on the potassium to
[SPEAKER_00]: meet the plant demands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be used as an additional
amendment if at all, because of its slow
[SPEAKER_00]: availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would possibly be better alternative to
plain sands.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at adding sand to add to
your media, maybe choose greensand for
[SPEAKER_00]: some of its micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we're going to look at worm
castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main source is red wigglers,
not the earthworms we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very quickly available and often used
as a soil amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often added for the diverse microbes
that it contains to help increase soil
[SPEAKER_00]: biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only a small amount is needed if the
conditions are favorable, as the microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: will multiply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to grow purely in worm
castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another advantage, especially being added
to soil media, is that it has a near
[SPEAKER_00]: neutral pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, again, why it's liked by many
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, again, just gives you that
brief overview of some of the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer options that are available to
you, and some that you commonly see in
[SPEAKER_00]: super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this can give you a nice
background to determine whether or not
[SPEAKER_00]: it's worth considering that as an additive
to your particular growing media.
