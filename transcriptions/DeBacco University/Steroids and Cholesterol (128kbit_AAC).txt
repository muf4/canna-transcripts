[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, continuing with the macromolecule of
lipids, we're going to look specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: here at steroids and cholesterol and how
they relate to the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting first with steroids,
they're composed of four rings of carbon,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we see them labeled here, A,
B, C, and D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examples are cholesterol, found in most
animal cell membranes, and female and male
[SPEAKER_00]: sex hormones are also following the
category of steroids, which is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: three forms of lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, the other two are fats and
phospholipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking specifically at cholesterol
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fatty substance found only in
animal foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also produced by our bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small amounts are needed by the body for
essential functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want you to think that cholesterol
is entirely a bad thing because small
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts are still needed by the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the issue comes in is where we have
excessive amounts of cholesterol,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it can form this fatty plaque which
sticks to the inside of our arteries,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this can cause heart disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need our red blood cells to easily
flow through our veins and our arteries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have this build with these
plaques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now think about if we have blood flow
going through here, I think it's well and
[SPEAKER_00]: fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if we restrict it down to here,
we can have some serious issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get heart attacks, various heart
disease, even in extreme cases death can
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now cholesterol, we have HDL, which is
considered good cholesterol, and LDL,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is considered bad cholesterol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So LDL stands for low density
lipoproteins, and this carries cholesterol
[SPEAKER_00]: around in the blood, and it can form those
plaques I talked about in your arteries.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, they can increase the risk
for heart disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So negative things with the LDL pathway
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: HDLs, though, are considered the good
cholesterol.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the high density lipoproteins,
and these carry cholesterol to the liver
[SPEAKER_00]: and also out of the body for processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the liver can process it synthesized by
the liver picks up cholesterol in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues, and can allow it to be excreted
from the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps avoid plaques and heart
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about cholesterol,
the broad term, please realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's low density and high density forms
of cholesterol, and the high density are
[SPEAKER_00]: considered the beneficial ones for the
body, while the LDL, the low density
[SPEAKER_00]: lipoproteins, have negative effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now triclyceride level in the blood is a
fat that circulates the blood and
[SPEAKER_00]: increases risk of heart disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like once, if you melted a butter
stick with four fifths gallon of water,
[SPEAKER_00]: produce a milky kind of looking liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these triglycerides have that kind of
milky look to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, having none of them is not
necessarily the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under 150 milligrams per deciliter is the
normal or level of low concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Borderline high is 150 to 150.
[SPEAKER_00]: Borderline is over 200 to 239,
and high risk is over 240.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's milligrams per deciliter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can break down that cholesterol instead
of just that total.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at the high density and low
density in the triglyceride level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember the high densities are the
beneficial ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to see that number ideally 60 or
above.
[SPEAKER_00]: LDL want to be under 100, and
triglycerides under 150 would be the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we get blood work done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why there might be these ranges
or these goal amounts is we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay within that accepted kind of average
or normal levels of distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't true for everyone, and they may
be changing some of these levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it gives you just an idea of that
total cholesterol under 200, but breaking
[SPEAKER_00]: it down further into the different types
of cholesterol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you get a better
understanding for the difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, risk factors occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do have a family history of high
or low density lipoproteins, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, negative cholesterol,
that can be increased by if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: overweight and obesity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your diet can also impact that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your sedentary lifestyle, your family
tree, your history, if you're a cigarette
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker, hypertension, diabetes type two
can also contribute to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you have a combination of
these factors can really increase the odds
[SPEAKER_00]: of you having a cholesterol problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a family history and a
sedentary lifestyle and an unhealthy diet,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can really help contribute to
developing this high cholesterol and
[SPEAKER_00]: negative effects seen by the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Management or eating a healthy diet,
exercising, keeping weight in the normal
[SPEAKER_00]: range, hypersensitive, diabetic,
keep under control, don't smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: and get your cholesterol checked at least
once a year if you have risk factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just various good practices in general
in both diet and health that helps you be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to manage if you are at risk for
cholesterol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, exercise.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we consider to exercise so it can
help boost your HDL or your good
[SPEAKER_00]: cholesterol.
[SPEAKER_00]: This reduces the risk of heart disease,
helps control your weight, and helps
[SPEAKER_00]: control diabetes and hypertension.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say exercise, this isn't just run
up the stairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is exercise for at least 30 minutes
daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can choose from a variety of
exercise that you help to enjoy and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't pick something that you kind of
have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to incorporate 30 minutes of some form
of exercise daily that you might enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for some people that's running,
for some people that could be swimming,
[SPEAKER_00]: that could be jogging, find something that
works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This exercise here is defined as 30
minutes of daily active work.
