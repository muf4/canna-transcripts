[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to go over an overview of
[SPEAKER_00]: FAR-RED's impact on cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to be looking at
FAR-RED's impact, which is the wavelengths
[SPEAKER_00]: right down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, let's define red light,
which you might be more familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red light is at least as effective as
other colors of light at promoting plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: While red light may not be the most
efficient color for general illumination
[SPEAKER_00]: for people, for high lumens, it is among
the best colors of light to stimulate
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth due to the role in
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only grow plants under red light
with no blue light, they will be elongated
[SPEAKER_00]: or kind of a stretched internode spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red LEDs are the most efficient of the
colors, and that's why you typically see
[SPEAKER_00]: them a lot of times integrated to those
particular light sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, here's that kind of red light
spectrum located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here we're going to talk about
FAR-RED light, so a little different,
[SPEAKER_00]: some similarities, but a little different,
as FAR-RED influences the size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, the length of stems, and
ultimately the height of the plants as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: FAR-RED may make some plants flower
earlier, so there could be other impacts
[SPEAKER_00]: when giving plants FAR-RED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: To measure it, you need a
spectrorodometer, which is a light
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement tool that is able to measure
both the wavelength and the amplitude of
[SPEAKER_00]: the light emitted from a light source.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this comes at increased cost due
to internal complexity of the device,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you want to make sure you have the
proper device to capture this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelength if you're looking at doing a
study or looking at really analyzing
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly how much you're giving plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this FAR-RED light is in that 700 to
800 nanometers in length.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the change in a tomato plant
and what looks like a squash plant as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Control plants versus giving them FAR-RED,
we can see that definitely that much more
[SPEAKER_00]: stretched appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, light's ability to penetrate the
leaf, so if we're looking at comparisons
[SPEAKER_00]: of kind of different wavelengths,
notice that both the green and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: FAR-RED light penetrate deep into the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue and red are absorbed mainly in the
chlorophyll, which is located in greater
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations on the upper leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the deep penetration suggests
that structures other than chlorophyll are
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for the utilization of these
particular wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: If most of the chlorophylls at the surface
make sense for blue and red to be absorbed
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but if they're being able to
penetrate deeper into the leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: there may be other methods for the plant
to absorb that particular light energy
[SPEAKER_00]: from those particular wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants response to shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reductions in the red to FAR-RED ratio,
the RFR ratio, 660 nanometers to 740
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers proportion, are the most
predominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the left here, we have the y-axis
for full sun data, and the right we have
[SPEAKER_00]: the y-axis for both moderate and deep
foliar shade data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing a comparison here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here's our full sun,
and here's our kind of our moderate to
[SPEAKER_00]: deep shade kind of colorations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the moderate to deep shade,
we're seeing a definitely jump up or an
[SPEAKER_00]: increase here in the photon flux there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this kind of tell us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that kind of goes back to that
ability to penetrate deeper into the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So FAR-REDs and under leaf comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the over leaf, we have the
under leaf, above and below leaf spectrums
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison here in this chart provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice how the under leaf still receives
about 50% of the total FAR-RED compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: the minimum percentage of other colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say minimum percentage,
like, well, it's pretty equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll look comparison to the greens,
the yellows, some of the oranges,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of the reds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing it's a large space.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a large gap there indicating it's
receiving a very small percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, where the FAR-RED is only this tall,
we almost see an increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The distance here is almost halfway.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 50% of the total FAR-RED it's able
to absorb under the leaf as it is in
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison to over the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of an important part of
this image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the red and FAR-RED kind of ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ratio of red and FAR-RED changes in
full sun versus shade conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full sun has equal red and FAR-RED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under plant shade, most of the red is
used, but the FAR-RED will reach the
[SPEAKER_00]: shaded plant, as you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So direct sunlight is our canopy shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get to that FAR-RED spectrum,
we notice that amount relative of photon
[SPEAKER_00]: flux density percentage increases
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will induce shade avoidance by
changing morphology and can induce early
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering in some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shading from another plant reduces both
the light intensity and also changes the
[SPEAKER_00]: light quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Changes in quality include red to FAR-RED
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in direct sunlight, the ratio is about
1 to 1.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the shade, the ratio is only 0.23.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a massive shift in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now FAR-RED plant shade impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's that same comparison here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the FAR-RED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal morphology should be a plant that
looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a shade avoidance plant,
it's grown in kind of a shady location
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're kind of looking at the
wavelengths here or under the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we see shade avoidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have small leaves that
are going to stretch quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're a shade tolerant plant,
this same amount of light or kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: filtered spectrum of light they're going
to have a much shorter compact kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology and the leaves will become a
little bit wider as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this under the shade, remember
direct sunlight, where all these leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: are getting the direct sunlight,
under this tree are going to be what's
[SPEAKER_00]: called the canopy shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that spectrum definitely shifts and
changes for those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this example, so their
morphologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at petunia ceiling,
growing under different light for another
[SPEAKER_00]: little source of comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: B is blue, R is red, FR is FAR-RED,
micromoles, per meter squared per second
[SPEAKER_00]: is the subscript number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And high versus low light intensities of
red and FAR-RED while keeping blue light
[SPEAKER_00]: intensities constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see kind of some great kind of
images here in comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue light, their subscript,
is consistent through all of these trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that the plants look very
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're changing or in this study
changed the amount of red and FAR-RED that
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants were receiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that intensity is the subscript number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see that in this case,
it was given twice as much red versus
[SPEAKER_00]: FAR-RED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it was given equal red and FAR-RED.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can definitely see the changes in
morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: They measured specifically plant height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives you that nice little
comparison to see what impact the
[SPEAKER_00]: different wavelengths can have on the
morphology of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now interaction of red and FAR-RED and
PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember that's photosynthetically
photon flux density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transplanted seedlings from previous slide
to a greenhouse now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of the seedling stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go a little bit longer in their
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: All grown under the same conditions
including light after transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's kind of an interesting note is
that while these plants started here and
[SPEAKER_00]: they got different light treatments,
they were then all moved to a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: setting and they all got normal light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does this seedling environment
impact the flower cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that there is some
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants flower faster under high light
intensity light and also when grown under
[SPEAKER_00]: FAR-RED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that shift there when they had
equal blue and red.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't even flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see a shift in the days to flower
from transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the blue and the intense red and
FAR-RED being the quickest here for days
[SPEAKER_00]: to flower after transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just an interesting note that in the
seedling stage the wavelengths that plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are given can have impacts when they get
older even if there's a transition point
[SPEAKER_00]: where then they're all given consistent
amount of lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least here in petunias.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the impact on yield with adding
FAR-RED since that's probably like
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting thing to kind of take a look
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: FAR-RED is in the 700 to 800 nanometer
wavelength range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is outside of the PPFD range of
measurement which only takes into account
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 to 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lettuce is a leafy green that shows great
response to FAR-RED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically growing it for that kind of leaf
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduced PPFD in FAR-RED trials attempts to
provide all plants with consistent PFD of
[SPEAKER_00]: 350 micromoles premier squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at dry mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is again looking at lettuce yield
with FAR-RED added.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry mass data here was normalized to have
the 350 PPFD trials be in even 100 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So normalized here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were set at 100 so we can have a
much easier visual comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both trials had FAR-RED added improved
yields with the white or full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: light having the largest yield overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is in comparison to the red-blue
only wavelengths compared to the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: white wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we see here not only are we having
an increase in overall yield but in
[SPEAKER_00]: addition we're being able to diagnose
potential plant problems with this full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum LED light as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So better yield and better to diagnose
disease overall probably a more favorable
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we add FAR-RED again getting that
increase in dry mass as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a side note in the study that they
were run at 300 because they were assuming
[SPEAKER_00]: another 50 was coming from the FAR-RED to
keep that 350 amount of intensive light
[SPEAKER_00]: the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only changing the spectrum that those
plants were given.
[SPEAKER_00]: So added FAR-RED light can increase cell
expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So control in FAR-RED we see with tomato,
soybean, cucumber, and spinach the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in morphologies pretty stark
and different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even here just looking at them we can
definitely see that there is overall an
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in plant height when we add that
FAR-RED there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now common light sources in percent
FAR-RED produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's just some you might be familiar
with CMH lights or high pressure sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as a note sunlight does produce 20%
FAR-RED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: However when we saw the comparison before
why don't all the plants super stretch at
[SPEAKER_00]: a very high amount when we're looking at
sunlight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well keep in mind sunshine also has high
levels of blue light about 27% in UVA
[SPEAKER_00]: which reduce cell expansion and
stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's kind of that like balancing
effect there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these other lights are just
producing more of that FAR-RED with
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in that blue wavelengths and
that's why you tend to get some more of
[SPEAKER_00]: that stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's FAR-RED's impact on cannabis
production?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well FAR-RED can cause cannabis plant
stretching so is advised to be of greater
[SPEAKER_00]: importance later in the growing cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: FAR-RED exposure may also induce earlier
flowering times in cannabis so that should
[SPEAKER_00]: be make note of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When growing outdoors the high 20% FAR-RED
is countered acted by the very high 27%
[SPEAKER_00]: blue light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't say oh sunlight's got 20% FAR-RED
let me give my plants 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember sunlight is giving a bunch of
other spectrums as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When measuring light at PFD meter will
take into account UV and FAR-RED light but
[SPEAKER_00]: this should only be done with LED lights
and not high pressure sodium lights due to
[SPEAKER_00]: the strong infrared spectrum they also
produce which might give you an
[SPEAKER_00]: artificially high reading of PFD if you're
taking into account those additional
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you want to learn more where this
kind of information came from special
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks to all of the researchers shown
here sharing their information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're able to glean some
information from what I've kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: summarized and presented here as a way to
kind of better understand light's impact
[SPEAKER_00]: on cannabis plants.
