[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another video here on Tobacco
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video we're going to be looking at
hair and its relation to DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here's a long braided hair and
here is the double helix of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now DNA analysis is only possible if the
bulb at the base of the hair is intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that bulb region is down
here closer to the root end of the hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hair bulb forms at the base of the
hair follicle and in the hair bulb living
[SPEAKER_00]: cells divide and grow to build the hair
shaft.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's important for DNA
analysis because the blood vessels that
[SPEAKER_00]: nurse the cells in the hair bulb deliver
more hormones that modify hair growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: structure at different times so that can
be useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition those growing cells are more
likely to contain that important DNA when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at trying to take hair which
is a class characteristic and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: get it more in the chance but being in the
individual characteristic category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it different growth stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that advancements in DNA
profiling can now individualize human
[SPEAKER_00]: hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: The probability of detecting DNA at the
hair roots is more likely for hair being
[SPEAKER_00]: examined in different growth phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have the different growth
phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have the early growth phase
which is always referred to as the antigen
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the middle growth phase as
the ketogen phase and then the telogen
[SPEAKER_00]: phase which is the final phase here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here in DNA specifically when hair is
forcibly removed often a follicle tag
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a translucent piece of tissue
surrounding the hair shaft may be present
[SPEAKER_00]: and it kind of looks like this right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a root with a follicle tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other roots surrounded by tissue this will
have nuclear DNA and this has proven to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a rich source of that nuclear DNA
associated with the hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind if you're finding a hair
piece without the follicular tag here the
[SPEAKER_00]: root is club-shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be basically no nuclear
DNA located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of the gold mine here for
finding that DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have those cells around that kind of
root of the hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at hair in the mitochondrial DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mitochondrial DNA is found outside the
nucleus and is transmitted only from the
[SPEAKER_00]: mother to child.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ideally nuclear DNA is what we want to
find but mitochondrial DNA should not be
[SPEAKER_00]: overlooked because mitochondrial DNA can
be extracted from the hair shaft.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a rule all positive microscopic hair
comparisons must be confirmed by DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again why the mitochondrial DNA may
only be tied to the maternal line still
[SPEAKER_00]: can be important information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can still help eliminate potential
suspects on a list to try to get to that
[SPEAKER_00]: more individual characteristic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when we're collecting hair as a
baseline and ideally the general rule
[SPEAKER_00]: forensics hair comparisons involved either
head hair or pubic hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So head hair ideally we're looking to
collect about 50 full length head hair
[SPEAKER_00]: samples from all ears of the scalp will
normally ensure a representative sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pubic hair we're looking at about 24 full
length pubic hairs or should cover the
[SPEAKER_00]: range of characteristics present in pubic
hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hair samples should also be collected from
victims or suspicious deaths during an
[SPEAKER_00]: autopsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times if you're just
investigating a crime scene without a body
[SPEAKER_00]: you may find hair samples but it may be
difficult to find 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're looking at particularly an
autopsy or have the ability to collect
[SPEAKER_00]: hair and have access to 50 head hair
samples or 24 pubic hair samples those
[SPEAKER_00]: would definitely be advised because it
would help determine or reduce the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: range of hair variability to allow you to
kind of get a little bit more closer to
[SPEAKER_00]: that individual characteristic when we're
looking at identifying different hair samples.
