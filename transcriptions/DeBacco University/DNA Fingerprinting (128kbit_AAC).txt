[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, DNA fingerprinting, as the name
implies, is a unique look to DNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, the fragments.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see here on the screen,
it looks like, of course, I touched the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen there and it's a big fingerprint
here, but we'll clean that up a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking here at deciphering out DNA and
how it can be unique to particular
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals and what that can tell us.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so our fingerprinting,
each person's DNA pattern different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good question to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have actually sections of what's
commonly referred to as junk DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really encode for proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made of repeated patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each person may have different number of
repeats, and many sites in our 23
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes have different repeated
patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: These different patterns, just like the
patterns on our fingers, give us what we
[SPEAKER_00]: call the DNA fingerprint, identify us as
unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an example here of looking at
all the different Gs and Cs, the different
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns that do occur, and how different
individuals, if these two individuals have
[SPEAKER_00]: different repeated patterns here,
and how those ingredients hopefully stand
[SPEAKER_00]: out a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So DNA patterns for DNA fingerprints.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have allele one, and I've indicated a
couple things here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our cut sites, remember our restriction
enzymes are cutting at very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: sites, and these in red, in red,
are the same cut sites, the same
[SPEAKER_00]: restriction enzyme will cut at both of
those sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cut the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice here, try to separate out,
cut the DNA there a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our section one, our section two,
and our section three.
[SPEAKER_00]: How this would look when we run a gel,
section one, section two, and section
[SPEAKER_00]: three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the yellow one here and our two
other darker regions here for allele one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, difference between two people,
now we have person two with more repeats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we go through, we cut that section
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our section one, our section two,
and our section three, and as we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: here, we're getting a different run of
gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two cut sites, one and three,
are the same size, but this section two is
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more junk DNA essentially here,
causing it to be a different run on the
[SPEAKER_00]: gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our DNA fingerprints are comparing our
blood samples of defense clothing on that
[SPEAKER_00]: of a victim.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here's mom, here's dad,
and then we're looking at other potential
[SPEAKER_00]: matches here on the offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are gonna be differences in
offspring comparing because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: through the common DNA, through crossing
over, through independent assortment and
[SPEAKER_00]: all that, you're gonna get slightly
different DNA sequences, but you're still
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna notice odds are some similarities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the example here comparing the
defendant's blood, the victim's blood,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then potential blood from defense
clothes, we're able again to develop this
[SPEAKER_00]: fingerprint to get sort of a comparison
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see where victim's blood may
have gotten cross contaminated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some of the power of genetics
that's used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this process is what used to determine
if two samples are from the same source.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at DNA of two sources of
fragments with restriction enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember those restriction enzymes cut at
very specific regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fragments are separated using the gel
electroporesis and transferred to the
[SPEAKER_00]: filler, and then here we're able to probe
and compare them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also used for evolutionary relationships,
compare DNA samples from different
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms to measure how closely they may
be related genetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our DNA for sample two,
sample three, sample four, and sample
[SPEAKER_00]: five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the larger segments are up here,
the smaller ones are down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this allows us to see how a turtle,
a snake, a rat, squirrel, and a fruit fly
[SPEAKER_00]: all may interrelate on what commonalities
they may have, what may be similar,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what might be more distinctly related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So medical diagnosis comparing normal
alleles to a disease allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a chromosome with normal allele and
a disease causing allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we run those alleles on the gel and
we see that they do cut at different
[SPEAKER_00]: regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The example would be one of Huntington's
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking to identify those different
alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you say, well, they're the same
length, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can there be different sizes to DNA
fragments if they're the same length?
[SPEAKER_00]: While they are in total the same length,
there's different sequences in those
[SPEAKER_00]: restriction enzymes are going to cut this
at different portions, giving it to
[SPEAKER_00]: different fragments than this allele here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forensics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we commonly associate things
with comparing samples from a crime scene
[SPEAKER_00]: of the suspect and a victim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our suspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our crime scene sample,
I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Volunteer here, or our victim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at three different
suspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the victim typically will volunteer
with their sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the crime scene sample,
and now we need to determine potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: which one of these three subjects if
there's any correlation or matching that
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suspect one, suspect two, suspect three,
comparing to the crime scene sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking for commonalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially we look at this one and we
say, well, suspect two and three both
[SPEAKER_00]: share this.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we need to compare all of the
bands to ver the true fingerprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see as we get down here,
suspect two matches not only this band,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also this band, this band,
and this band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and suspect two is a very close
match for the sample at the crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is different than the victim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our suspect two is the most likely
match here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So RFLP restriction fragment length
polymorphism and electrophoresis is used
[SPEAKER_00]: in forensic science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could be getting a semen sample from
a rapist and a blood sample from the
[SPEAKER_00]: suspect, running it against the standard
and allowing us to develop a sense of
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison of what may match up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because DNA fingerprint are unique,
this can allow us to eliminate other
[SPEAKER_00]: potential suspects and get close to
identifying an individual or determine
[SPEAKER_00]: whether an individual of interest has left
DNA behind and has a potential to be there
[SPEAKER_00]: on the scene and contribute something in
some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the RFLP again, these are just markers
that are used and we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: different cut sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember those restriction enzymes are
going to read right along and cut at very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we see here, there are more cut sites
indicating smaller fragments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here there's only one cut site,
a very large fragment not running very far
[SPEAKER_00]: in the gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can just do a real world example
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a Myrtle trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think the suspect is guilty?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our standard and here's what
we're comparing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So blood sample one from the crime scene,
blood sample two, blood sample three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And try to indicate here, again,
I did get this PowerPoint on line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll look in the description for the
links, where I take the sources here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I added some pictures, which are also
indicated as far as where I got those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at, it's a little faint,
might be a little hard to initially see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we look at these regions right
here, we can clearly see there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: bands occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to mark those with some arrows there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blood sample two from the crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless there's a greater collection here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And blood sample three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of those three matching,
this matching, and this matching.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we compare blood sample one and
three, we see a lot of commonalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blood sample two, not as many.
[SPEAKER_00]: So blood sample from the victim.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little hard to see again on this image,
but very closely matching the blood sample
[SPEAKER_00]: number two listed above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blood sample from the victim here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed a little bit of a different
pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And blood sample from the suspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see again, the circles and the
colors, hopefully try to match it up a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the blood sample here was from O.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simpson.
[SPEAKER_00]: The victim here was Nicole Brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Ron Goldman, myself up here a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see where our suspects and
victims and crime scene, how we're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting now to develop a pattern of what
we're kind of seeing, what matches up with
[SPEAKER_00]: what.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some of the power that the DNA
kind of can serve.
[SPEAKER_00]: To try to help us correlate if someone was
potentially there because of the unique
[SPEAKER_00]: fingerprints that individuals have in
their DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Nicole Brown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how gel looks in real life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, as you saw in that example,
they may not always be perfectly clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's typically a DNA ladder loaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that tells us what the size the bands
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That allows us to compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: These thicker bands here, and again,
there's more DNA of that particular size
[SPEAKER_00]: present in the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here, they're not always
super easy to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for paternity test, here's mom's DNA,
here's the child's DNA, and we have two
[SPEAKER_00]: potential father figures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at determining which father,
if any of these, match up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's father one, there's father two,
compared to the child.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice the child shares these bands and
these commonalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting father two, in this case,
is the most likely father of the child.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, whose DNA has been sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this was helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some other great videos on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also go through, and if you click
on these links, again, the links to these
[SPEAKER_00]: are provided in the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the slideshow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually try the process of PCR
yourself, virtually, and also
[SPEAKER_00]: electrophoresis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have videos posted on both of these that
you're welcome to look at to hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: supply you with some good information to
develop a good understanding of the process.
