[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBacco University video,
I'm going to go over glandular trichrome
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and biosynthesis to give you a
better appreciation for the formation of
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into a review of the
articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are two articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the first one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, some great information provided in
these, as well as the citation provided
[SPEAKER_00]: here, as well as in the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one and then this is the
second one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on the slide, I'll cite what
source it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, kind of like this general
summary slide here, it kind of gives you
[SPEAKER_00]: an idea of a little bit of the
experimentation as well as the progression
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long they spend in kind of that long
day vegetative stage compared to the short
[SPEAKER_00]: day conditions where they're flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when the researchers recommend
applying that silver nitrate treatment as
[SPEAKER_00]: we look at the development of the growth
cycle of the plant, as well as some other
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific studies that they looked at and
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just good for timing and good general
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at the researchers and what
they provide you with the kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: general timelines there in more of a word
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I provide you some general pictures
here, but cannabis does exhibit a
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively short growth cycle lasting only
about two to five months.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seedling stage is defined for
somewhere in that three to 10 day range
[SPEAKER_00]: post germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the vegetative growth stage,
we're growing the leaves and the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 20 to 30 days and this is when
the plant is focused really on that root
[SPEAKER_00]: and shoot development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rapid growth of the upper part of the
plant is maintained for 10 to 30 days and
[SPEAKER_00]: then of course there's the focus on
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pre flowers, we can see right here,
our shoots as cuttings are suitable for
[SPEAKER_00]: asexual propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowering is initiated in cannabis can
be induced by subjecting the plants to a
[SPEAKER_00]: short day conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not talking about auto flowers,
but this short day conditions could induce
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering at any stage or any age.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be careful and it's why I show
those timelines is that's when it's most
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous because you want a plant that
can actually support flowers for the end
[SPEAKER_00]: result.
[SPEAKER_00]: After approximately a week, flowers begin
to appear at the top of branches post
[SPEAKER_00]: switching it to a short day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowering phase typically lasts for
about a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at the growth
experiment, which I mentioned the silver
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: When treating with the hormones or silver
nitrate, female plants can be transformed
[SPEAKER_00]: into male plants, which is great for
breeding purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The harvesting of inflorescence for
cannabinoids is typically done when the
[SPEAKER_00]: pistols have withered and some of the
trichomes are an amber color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other videos going into that in more
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: If female flowers are pollinated during
the flowering phase, seeds can be
[SPEAKER_00]: collected after approximately a month when
they should be mature and allowing you to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow the next phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: New varieties with high CBD yield can be
obtained through harmonization breeding or
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular breeding techniques,
which is great ways to get new varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always seeing new things come into
the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now different types of glandular
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So GT when you see that abbreviation,
that's going to stand for glandular
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind for that
abbreviation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, scanning electron microscopy
analysis, illustrating the different
[SPEAKER_00]: glandular trichomes types on the surface
of various tissues in our cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see type one, type two, type three
and type four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see them defined right here
where type one is that caputase stocked
[SPEAKER_00]: glandular trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type three is a caputase sisal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glandular trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three is the bulbous and four is the
non-secretory there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see in the flowering primary
trichomes in this area of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to find potentially all five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely as you get later into harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bracts here are also going to find a
five in that top portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the stem you find primarily just the
type four, which don't secrete any
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and the leaf also primary
type four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just because you're finding
trichomes don't mean that they're the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes that contain the cannabinoids
and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many growers are seeking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So regulatory network.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get too much into the
detail of this, but this is a summarized
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptional regulatory network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want you to take away from this
is the complexities of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this isn't done actually on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done actually on tomato and sweet
wormwood, which also have trichomes which
[SPEAKER_00]: are analogous or similar to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to see some more of that cannabis
specific research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is providing our starting point
because we need a starting point because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now where we see the arrows those indicate
an up regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where we see the kind of ended kind of
blunt lines there that indicates a down
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation or inhibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certain things, certain components can
up regulate things and certain things can
[SPEAKER_00]: down regulate or suppress things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's how these are interacting,
which is really important to better
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the full development of these
trichomes in the cannabinoids and terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: that they contain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking a little bit more at the
details here of the biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to break these apart into a little
more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the basic structure,
which you're hopefully visually used to
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we're going to go into a little
bit of that kind of that zoomed in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just what's occurring in this region is
a zoom in version of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just what's occurring in this region
is zoom in of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see again how you want to look
at it macroscopically as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially microscopically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is another schematic model here
showing the structure trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, different researchers showing how
it formations on that epidural normal area
[SPEAKER_00]: there and kind of forms a little bit of a
bulb and then kind of forms that stalked
[SPEAKER_00]: region eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, zoomed in versions of different
regions there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great diagrams to pause the video,
take a look at, go back to the original
[SPEAKER_00]: study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, structural diagram here of those that
are secreting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those cannabis glandular trichomes are
distinctive secretory structures that are
[SPEAKER_00]: critical in the production and reservation
of cannabinoids, primarily found in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bracts, flowers of female cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, those found on the leaves,
those found on the main stems,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't really secrete anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now mature glandular trichomes showing the
extracellular storage cavity and secretory
[SPEAKER_00]: cells on the large multicellular stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now following glandular trichome
inhibition, post-dermal cells
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiate into secretory abscission
and stalk cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're having here is this
development, these specialized structures
[SPEAKER_00]: as we're developing this stalked region on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically causing the droplet to form
on the top or the cavity to form on top
[SPEAKER_00]: where all those droplets are going to be
added to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's going to swell up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where a lot of those storage
areas are going to be kept distinctly and
[SPEAKER_00]: physically away from the leaf and plant
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, this is what they look like
kind of if you're looking at, used to
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at through a magnifying loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are known as the plant chemical
factories.
[SPEAKER_00]: These areas here where they're secreting,
synthesizing, accumulating, and storing
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple secondary metabolites,
for example, cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: These structures are primarily found on
the bracts and flowers of female cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we could see them in high
density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the isolation analysis of glandular
trichomes, CBGA and THCA are produced in
[SPEAKER_00]: both bulbous glandular trichomes and
stalked ones as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see here's bulbous ones,
very, very small, and then the stalked
[SPEAKER_00]: ones, which are probably more familiar
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBC and CBN were specifically detected in
bulbous stalked trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these are the ones here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stalked glandular trichomes have
higher accumulations of mono terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is based on auto fluorescence
studies that were conducted there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as a reminder, it's THCA and CBGA
because that's the plant form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's kind of the acid form that
then needs to be decarboxylated to make
[SPEAKER_00]: the active form for the receptors in
humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now cannabinoid synthesis, the synthesis
have greater metabolic efficiencies in
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrophobic environments compared to
aqueous ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lipid-based or fat-based environments
are going to be the ones that are more
[SPEAKER_00]: favorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The metabolite polysaccharide wall-bound
may be a favorable micro environment that
[SPEAKER_00]: is well suited for THCA biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could explain the abundant
synthesis and secretion of cannabinoids in
[SPEAKER_00]: these glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the ability of these glandular
trichomes, which again, are small in
[SPEAKER_00]: physical size, to produce and secrete
these significant quantities of secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites still remains a mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot that still needs to be
studied, a lot that still needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: better understood about these specific
pathways of how these plants go about
[SPEAKER_00]: producing these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the stock glandular trichome
development and development trajectory of
[SPEAKER_00]: stock glandular trichomes from the
prodermal initiation, which is on the left
[SPEAKER_00]: here, to the sessile-like intermediate
with a small metabolite droplet to the
[SPEAKER_00]: mature, over-mature trichomes all the way
on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know a little bit about the
formation of the physical structure of
[SPEAKER_00]: these and how they go about those
distinctive stages, but understanding more
[SPEAKER_00]: about the intercellular and the gene
regulation is definitely needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that trichome development,
again, the first step of that trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: development is a differentiation of those
cells, trigger a series of cell divisions
[SPEAKER_00]: resulting in that epidermal outgrowth,
that stocked formation, that physical
[SPEAKER_00]: stocked tower-like look.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exact regulatory mechanisms that
trigger the development of these cells in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, at least, is still unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we know what kind of what
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't know what triggers it,
what initiates that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other species, as I said, like tomato and
sweet wormwood, are providing useful
[SPEAKER_00]: comparisons, but we need to research
cannabis a little bit further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the cannabinoid and terpene
biosynthesis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So secretory cells form this
interconnected syncytium responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid and terpene biosynthesis,
transport and storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This syncytium is a single cell or
cytoplasmic mass containing several nuclei
[SPEAKER_00]: formed by fusion of cells or by division
of the nuclei.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the formation of this storage cavity
will occur through the elimination of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we can see again this zoomed-in
portion, kind of what's occurring right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got all these important organelles
within the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at these particular regions
here or where this is occurring,
[SPEAKER_00]: giving us an idea where to start focusing
some of the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now distributions of the placids here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at the distribution
of placids in the secretory stage of these
[SPEAKER_00]: glandular trichomes, placids move between
cells via apertures in the glandular
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like little spaces or gaps,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is right below the cell wall and
leading into that storage cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're taking this very zoomed-in
kind of approach here, but we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at understanding at least initially where
some of these distributions are occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the formation of the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where CBGA likely partitions into
the plasmid membrane bilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabinoid biosynthesis occurs at the
disc cell wall where THCA synthesis or
[SPEAKER_00]: CBDA synthesis catalyzes CBGA to produce
THCA or CBGA respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that that CBG is that
precursor molecule that then is made by
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant's direction into THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it gets very complex here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trying to give you a general overview
and hopefully just an appreciation for
[SPEAKER_00]: what's occurring, even though we tend to
only look at those end products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids form the lipophilic
metabolite droplets within the apical cell
[SPEAKER_00]: wall, creating a storage cavity in space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, that's where it's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we start to look at our
trichomes going from that clear to clarity
[SPEAKER_00]: to potentially amber colorations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the cannabinoid biosynthetic pathway
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, looking at a little bit more detail
from the other researchers provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those metabolites interact with the
specialized cell wall components to form
[SPEAKER_00]: small metabolite droplets that basically
coalesce into a large central droplet and
[SPEAKER_00]: mature in the trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high resolution electronic miscarriage
demonstrates that these cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: secretory disc non-photosynthetic
plastids, which are producing all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: GPs, contain unusual crystal-like lattice
structure at the core.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically this kind of physical
structure, which looks like basically a
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern that you might see on a weave
pattern of, for example, of a fabric.
[SPEAKER_00]: The immunoglob TEM transmission electron
microscope using antibody-specific THCase
[SPEAKER_00]: localized THCase on the surface of cell
walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we kind of know where to look at
those surface of the cell walls,
[SPEAKER_00]: those secretory disc cells underlying the
storage cavity, but are not the
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-clinical or basal cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're developing this understanding to
kind of have this delimitation zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: this area of where things might be
occurring, or at least eliminating some
[SPEAKER_00]: areas where they're probably not
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the formation of these extracellular
cavities occurs by the delimitation and
[SPEAKER_00]: separation of those disc cells walls,
resulting in the wall layer that remains
[SPEAKER_00]: continuous with the plasma membrane,
which is the surface of the cell wall,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a second that remains continuous with
the cuticle, subcuticle layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at these different
layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at the building of
these structures, we're having these
[SPEAKER_00]: layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cell is starting to develop these
separate pockets or the separate
[SPEAKER_00]: categories there, allowing those certain
compounds to accumulate in different
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's these very specifically directed
specialization areas that those genes that
[SPEAKER_00]: are being activated to start to cause
these separated and distinctive regions
[SPEAKER_00]: are important to develop an understanding
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now extracellular storage, again,
to some cool macroscopic pictures here,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid and terpene products are
warehoused in the extracellular storage
[SPEAKER_00]: cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: These compounds are stored essentially
outside and away from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Important kind of key step here,
hopefully you've tuned in this long,
[SPEAKER_00]: where these compounds are very physically
separated from the plant, physically in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, made by the plant, but stored kind of
as far away from the plant as possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is an interesting kind of plant
evolutionary aspect of why is it developed
[SPEAKER_00]: these compounds and why are they kept so
far away from the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Final multicellular stocks rise to
glenotrichum heads above the epidermis,
[SPEAKER_00]: giving the cannabis flower their frosty
appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while this is a really zoomed in look
to it, that's what a bunch of these kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of this high density is causing that
frosty look to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go from that clear kind of that milky
white kind of appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now lastly, trichomes mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microscopy did show that once
trichomes have reached maturity,
[SPEAKER_00]: turning an amber like color, as we can see
here, resin droplets are secreted on the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface of the glandular head and the
cuticle collapses inward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the point at which we're
looking at peak maturity of those
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes, of those kind of secretory
compounds put there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know this was a little bit of a
detailed look.
[SPEAKER_00]: The research article is going into more
detail, but gives you an appreciation for
[SPEAKER_00]: that color change or those structures you
might be looking at and hopefully looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at in great detail what the plant's
actually doing and also a little maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: little shocking to try to understand the
research that still needs to continually
[SPEAKER_00]: be done to better understand this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
