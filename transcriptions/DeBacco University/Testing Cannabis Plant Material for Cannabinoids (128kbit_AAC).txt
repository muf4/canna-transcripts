[SPEAKER_00]: So in this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go into testing cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material for the all-important
cannabinoids, looking at some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical procedures that are done and
the importance of doing this on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at testing cannabis
plant material for cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, here's the research
article where a lot of the information is
[SPEAKER_00]: pulled from, so you're welcome to look at
this in more detail if this is of great
interest to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one reason why growers would test for
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, growers want to know how potent
their plant material is because the
[SPEAKER_00]: composition of certain chemical compounds
can largely impact the value and expected
[SPEAKER_00]: price paid for their produced end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how you can start to see some
different values here, different amounts,
[SPEAKER_00]: different costs, because it can relate to
the potential of the concentration of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and also potentially the
terpene profile present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is testing for cannabinoids
important just in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other testing that goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, you don't want to forget
about microbial testing and mycotoxin
[SPEAKER_00]: testing and heavy metal testing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why is cannabinoids important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's increasing evidence that the
ratios of CBD relative to other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids as well as endogenous
chemicals such as terpenes and flavonoids
[SPEAKER_00]: exhibit desirable entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important as far as looking at
the potential benefits to this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: The synergistic interactions between
cannabinoids and other chemicals may be
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for the medical benefits in
the actual individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why in part it's important to test
for these, not just to claim the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: or particular numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis testing and the pharmaceutical
testing practices is kind of like a merger
[SPEAKER_00]: between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we've talked about all the
importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a simplified version.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at kind of what an
analytical report can look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis has cannabinoid percentages
that are relatively high compared to other
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical compounds that may use
bioanalytical trace analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it's common to dilute cannabis or
hemp plants extracts by a hundred or a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand fold or more to reduce the
concentration of targeted cannabinoids to
[SPEAKER_00]: levels appropriate for the analytical
quantitative determination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means cannabis, relatively
speaking, to other pharmaceutical products
[SPEAKER_00]: has relatively concentrated, requiring it
to be diluted down to be able to perform
[SPEAKER_00]: with some of the proper analytical tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: These analytical procedures need to be
amended from current protocols to maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: the information content that is obtained
to ensure the information you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: as a consumer is accurate and
representative of the actual plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now current popular technique when
determining potency is HPLC, high pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid chromatography using a photodiode
array detector is commonly used in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry because it's relatively
easy and inexpensive to employ.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the different peaks will represent in
different compounds and there's different
[SPEAKER_00]: columns that can be used, column sizes,
mobile phase buffer solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of information goes into those
proper analytical techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the SIM LCMS technique, which is the
selective ion monitoring liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatography mass spec technique can
reduce the potential for unknown
[SPEAKER_00]: interferences due to co-illusion,
which can cause go unnoticed with the HPLC
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques that are used.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is simply providing a little bit more
of a precision way of analyzing those
[SPEAKER_00]: particular compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this liquid chromatography UV
chromatography compared to this different
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis, we can see a little comparison
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is some of the data presented in
that research article.
[SPEAKER_00]: This analysis of the sample shows much
improved selectivity and absence of
[SPEAKER_00]: interfering chromatography components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is that, when we go back here,
that selective ion and monitoring liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatography analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is due to the increased selectivity
techniques where only the protonated
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules of the targeted cannabinoids are
monitored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting a higher degree of
specificity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're seeing this standard method
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here we're seeing the selective
ion method employed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the analysis of the same
extract in comparison where in A the
[SPEAKER_00]: protonated molecules of the targeted
cannabinoids CBDA and CBD along with THC
[SPEAKER_00]: and THCA were monitored.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see a greater degree of precision,
hopefully a little bit more accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: results to get rid of some of what's
called the data noise that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: employed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, just looking at HPLC compared
to the two here, again, important to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like research and kind of have an idea
of the testing methods available and what
[SPEAKER_00]: the lab that you're getting tested from
results from might be utilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in contrast, to the HPLC method,
if either the LC or the LC-MS,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is liquid chromatography mass spec
analysis of the same samples performed,
[SPEAKER_00]: the considerably higher selectivity of
either of these techniques could
[SPEAKER_00]: facilitate qualitative identification of
unknown compounds, as well as mitigate the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for unexpected chemical
interferences for the quantitative
[SPEAKER_00]: determination of the targeted compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's more precise at looking at
very specific compounds, which can be very
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial when we're dealing with a plant
material that can have a whole host of
[SPEAKER_00]: potential other chemicals or background
noise there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be very selective in a sense
ensure we're getting a quality result,
[SPEAKER_00]: a targeted result and a very selective
result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while this might seem a little
complicated to studying, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the analytical equipment, it is part
of you being an informed consumer for
[SPEAKER_00]: typical products that you may look at
purchasing or as a grower or looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: getting submitted to a lab for analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
