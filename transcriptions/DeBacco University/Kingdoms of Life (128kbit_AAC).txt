[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at the
kingdoms of life and we're going to use
[SPEAKER_00]: this simple and basic six kingdom system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice we have our Eukarya up here
and our Prokaryotes down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are still classified and each is its
own independent kingdom and all supports
[SPEAKER_00]: life in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kingdoms of life, the designation
of kingdoms has changed over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to focus on one particular
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally there were only two kingdoms as
more organisms were obtained and the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers of kingdoms increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: The taxonomic level regarding higher than
a kingdom has also been recognized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that the domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a broader category or way to
categorize things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's some different approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to use this Woe's example from
1977.
[SPEAKER_00]: This six kingdom system where eubacteria,
archaeobacteria, protozoa, plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi, and animals is what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you'll notice way back if you watched
some of the previous videos talked about a
[SPEAKER_00]: simple two kingdom system or simple plants
and animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have since learned there's more
divisions than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way up to potentially eight
divisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice that just because we're choosing
this six kingdom system does not mean
[SPEAKER_00]: there's other six kingdom systems that
also exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to fit our purposes for our
class, but I want you to realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are different ways to potentially
classify living organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one we're going to most widely
use definitely in this class.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our phylogenetic tree of life,
you'll notice our bacteria, our archaea,
[SPEAKER_00]: and our eukaryote.
[SPEAKER_00]: What classifies as certain categories for
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is again just an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the branch points and the closer
things are to one another, the more
[SPEAKER_00]: closely they are related.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to spend a couple videos on
different organizations of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are more closely related to each
other than either is to bacteria because
[SPEAKER_00]: if you notice this branch point here,
both of these stem from the same area.
[SPEAKER_00]: These branch out earlier indicating these
bacteria are more distantly related than
[SPEAKER_00]: these two are to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the six kingdom system, that universal
ancestor, that common ancestor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we branch out and this is a one
stick figure way of presenting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of the bubble way and this is
another way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like this one I used when you've
seen it in some of the other slides
[SPEAKER_00]: because it kind of puts little pictures of
an animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the example of literally an animal
like a fish here, fungi, looks like a
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom, plants kind of looks like a
leaf, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see our protista, our
eubacteria, and kind of this gives a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of description, a very brief
description of what each is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does this look in the diagram of
relationship among the six kingdom system?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our original cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're noticing division points beyond
there and whatever shares a same division
[SPEAKER_00]: point shares that common ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these archaea, these three different
archaea are very closely related and very
[SPEAKER_00]: distantly related to say bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll notice here though we see our
mitochondria and our chloroplasts kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: bridging this gap from bacteria to kind of
the kingdom of eukarya.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are symbiotic events.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are events that occurred in both our
photosynthetic bacteria and also our
[SPEAKER_00]: purple bacteria with the mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the theories we talked about,
the endosymbiotic theory, where
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondria and chloroplasts were once
free-living bacteria that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporated into eukaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This example here again of our six kingdom
system provides the domain, the kingdom,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell type, the structures,
the number of cells, the mode of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition, and examples of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are different ways we can classify
them in ways that we can see how each is
[SPEAKER_00]: unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cell type, remember our prokaryotes
versus our eukaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eukaryotes are membrane-bound organelles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prokaryotes are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: This domain of eukarya is very broad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within eukarya there's protists,
there's fungi, there's plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice our domain of bacteria and archaea
are separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course we have our pycnoglycan
walls for our bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember what we did, we talked
about the gram stain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unicellular, both of these are
unicellular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these are multicellular.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be a couple that are
unicellular within the fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, eukarya, as far as plants and
animals goes, those are all multicellular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, here's some examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a nice little kind of comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you be able to compare or understand a
little bit about what makes the
[SPEAKER_00]: classification for each of these kingdoms
unique and different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
