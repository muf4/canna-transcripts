[SPEAKER_00]: So this is intended to be a very brief
overview of photosynthesis which is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: complex process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to break it down to the most basic and
simple terms here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this picture is as basic as I can make
it where we have a plant receiving
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight, carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere, water being absorbed through
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots, and as a result it's producing
oxygen and also sugar molecules here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the chemical kind of equation
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll look at this in just a little bit
more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a little different
representation of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's taking in carbon dioxide from
the air in the atmosphere specifically,
[SPEAKER_00]: H2O or water being absorbed in the roots
and root hairs specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is occurring in the presence of light
which is allowing the chlorophyll in the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf to synthesize carbohydrates,
a sugar molecule, and releasing oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: back into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now while we think about this occurring
with terrestrial plants, which is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important, also can't forget about the
oceans and the plankton that's occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: there producing basically half of the
amount of oxygen that we need to breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you'll notice also in this picture
ATP, Calvin cycle, light reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to get into details for
this lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very complex process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going over a very basic overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the general equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So photosynthesis is producing sugar,
which is glucose, and oxygen as
[SPEAKER_00]: byproducts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taking in carbon dioxide and water
and using light energy to assemble these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can familiarize yourself with
this basic equation of photosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully it gains a little bit greater
appreciation for the complexities of this
[SPEAKER_00]: process that plants are going through
allowing us to have the oxygen that we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to breathe.
