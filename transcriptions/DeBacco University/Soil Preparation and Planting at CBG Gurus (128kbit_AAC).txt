[SPEAKER_00]: In this Debaco University video,
we're going to go on site at the CBG Gurus
[SPEAKER_00]: establishment here to see their soil
preparation and also their planting and
[SPEAKER_00]: see the methods they imply to grow their
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great to allow for Sean and Jacob
to allow me out on their fields and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully teach you a little bit about
what they do in their hemp production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, who are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've got Sean here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Jacob of the CBG Gurus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their goal is to produce quality product
and manufactured instability in alignment
[SPEAKER_00]: with nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use, as we'll see, a layer of wood
chips to help maintain and improve soil
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also work with Korean natural
farming methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of idea and concept is to
kind of use kind of some of the modern
[SPEAKER_00]: science, allowing for sustainable and
abundant cultivation of crops worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can be applied more to than just
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Provide some of their contact information
here in their website if you want to take
[SPEAKER_00]: a look at them further.
[SPEAKER_00]: That microbial solution they're using,
and we'll hear a little bit about that
[SPEAKER_00]: described, it's called the JDOM microbial
solution or abbreviated JMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's looking at bringing back,
bringing farming back to farmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: restoring farmers' sovereignty and
technology, speed up the ultra low cost
[SPEAKER_00]: farming, and ultimately open a new world
where farmers, consumers, and mother
[SPEAKER_00]: nature are all in harmony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Provide some good links here if you want
to take a look at it a little bit further.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as the basic recipe here so you
can get a little bit of an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to explore that further,
take a look at these information provided
[SPEAKER_00]: here as well as in the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's go out to the field and see
exactly Sean and Jacob in action at the
[SPEAKER_02]: CBG Gurus.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we prepare our field with cardboard,
which decomposes first and kills the sod,
[SPEAKER_01]: covered in wood chips, which will
decompose second, kind of over time we get
[SPEAKER_01]: this really rich organic matter heavy and
kind of very worm casting heavy topsoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see if I hunt through a little
bit, I'm sure we'll find some worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we're trying to disturb them as
little as possible ideally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's one of the big advantages to
the back to Eden style farming is over
[SPEAKER_01]: time you're building really, really
organic matter rich topsoil and really
[SPEAKER_01]: helping the worm populations grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of other microbes and insects as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited as time progresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all really turns into that rich
topsoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's only been three years at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's probably an old row.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some really crazy increases in
organic matter from our first year to the
[SPEAKER_01]: second.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're doing the back to Eden style.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like more than more than like,
I think it was like two, 2.3% organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter increase in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the cardboard that we use to kill
the sod, we kind of figured that like,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it seemed as we were preparing the
holes, the sod decomposes really quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's still pretty alive,
has some nitrogen stored in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that gives you like an immediate kind
of boost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do have like grass, you know,
lawn or hay field can work quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the JDOM microbial solution,
which is really incredible for soil
[SPEAKER_01]: building and just like soil health in your
lower soil layers and the anaerobic
[SPEAKER_01]: layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing we learned from young son Cho at
his, he's the founder of JDOM is that the
[SPEAKER_01]: only the top two inches or so of your soil
is actually an aerobic environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So under that is really anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of like, you know, mycorrhizae
can thrive in a system like ours with all
[SPEAKER_01]: of the wood chips available for them to
eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also really important for soil
health to have your anaerobic environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like microbes deep down in the soil
breaking apart those minerals and rocks
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he created a recipe just using boiled
potatoes, salt, water, and then some soil
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look it up online, the JMS JDOM,
the JDOM microbial solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you let it ferment in like a bucket or
a barrel or tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: For about 24 to 36 hours watching as these
kind of rings of bubbles accumulate on
[SPEAKER_01]: top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once they are kind of concentric
circles in the tank, you can dilute it
[SPEAKER_01]: with water and pour it over your whole
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can do it when there are plants in
the ground, but it's a great soil prep and
[SPEAKER_01]: soil building technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: We heard Preston Smith speak about how he
built two inches of topsoil in three
[SPEAKER_01]: months using just JDOM microbial solution
and wood chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's just such a, it's just
such an efficient way of fermenting
[SPEAKER_01]: indigenous microbes that you can really
just get like insane levels of
[SPEAKER_01]: decomposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really amazing too for like
remediation can be done totally,
[SPEAKER_01]: cheaply, pretty easily anywhere in the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so Sean has drilled with the auger
these nice deep holes, hopefully about
[SPEAKER_01]: like two and a half feet or so deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm gonna come back in with a
pitchfork.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the holes are about eight inches
wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just gonna stick the pitchfork about
45 degree on the edge of the holes,
[SPEAKER_01]: kick it down and really just try to loosen
up some of that soil down there on each,
[SPEAKER_01]: on all four corners, all four sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll go around it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really trying to get like underneath the
wood chips and not really pull any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: wood chips into the hole so they don't sap
any of the nutrients, any of the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then once I kind of get around it,
I want to go back in and really loosen
[SPEAKER_01]: that soil up with the pitchfork.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty nice big hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big loose hole, little rock in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got the dunk bucket over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we made a big concoction of a,
the base of it was the Korean Natural
[SPEAKER_01]: Farming Seed Soak Solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the base four parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, okay, I can try, I think I can
remember what we got going on here in this
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the bone char in vinegar,
which is water soluble calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to some vinegar as like a
cleanser and take the pH balance has some,
[SPEAKER_01]: has a scoby in it too as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's the food element,
which is the fermented plant juice,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we just extract from fresh,
live, local foraged plants with like a raw
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use demerara sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, the last component is
the Oriental Herbal Nutrient, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: tincture of the five Chinese medicinal
herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have licorice, ginger, garlic,
angelica and cinnamon tincture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tinctured with vodka, two parts angelica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you keep them separate, but when you
do a dunk or a spray or mix it up and
[SPEAKER_01]: dilute it, you combine them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can combine them, you know,
for about a month ideally before.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what Mastercho says.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have some other beneficial microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got like a bio-tera from Biosafe
Systems, who's a nice organic company out
[SPEAKER_01]: of Connecticut that does like IPM
solutions and a couple other like
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial things mixed in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The air pruning on the sides, I think does
a nice thing maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they, the plants and deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the other thing that we found with
like the five inch versus the four inch
[SPEAKER_01]: pots, the depth just like really stunted
the growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were grown together for like two,
two and a half weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then by week three, like you can see
the taproot would hit the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_01]: small pot and then it would like slow
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas like the other one keeps sending
that taproot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the deeper the pot,
the more ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so we're going to take this
plant here with a flip, loosen that pot
[SPEAKER_01]: up, slide right out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see here, the like root growth is
perfect on these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they're not wrapping around the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going straight down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking pretty white and nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to take her and dip her
in here for a couple of seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there she goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a beauty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sour Tangy number three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like, we love these big pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're rocking.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant just grows so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially these clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got definitely some good genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one was some very tall, tall plants
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just going to wrap up around here
and give a little wood chip mulch and a
[SPEAKER_01]: little circle around her.
[SPEAKER_01]: To try to keep the wood chips a little bit
away from the beast, but she's also pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: big.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't really have to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice and woody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bag them and tag them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sour Tangy number three.
Thanks for watching.
I'll see you next time.
