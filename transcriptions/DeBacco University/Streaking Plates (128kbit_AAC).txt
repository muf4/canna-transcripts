[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over a proper
technique to streak plates so you get
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful plates that look like this when
you try to isolate and or grow bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal of plate streaking,
if done properly, you'll be able to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: small sample and either multiply it or
separate it into isolated samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're just looking at multiplying
it, and here we're looking at trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate individual colonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look a little closer here,
you can see these colonies are definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: different than these.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be able to pick one of these and
then go through and multiply that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the goals of plate streaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Required tools are a petri dish,
agar, the culture you're dealing with,
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculating loop, and also a flame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to be flaming the
inoculating loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're using a Bunsen burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to keep in mind that the
top of that middle cone is the hottest
[SPEAKER_00]: portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be way up here when you're
sterilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be way down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That very top portion of that center cone
is the best and hottest part when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at sterilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're inoculating loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: To transfer the culture, you want to
sterilize the loop, as I showed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: previous slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to just go directly from
the hot flame to the culture because
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll burn and kill them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after it cools, you want to pick up
the culture from the stock plate,
[SPEAKER_00]: spread the culture using a zigzag pattern
on only one portion of the petri dish,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of this back and forth motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that's going to do is it's going to
allow through friction cultures to be
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred to the media on that petri
dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're looking at spreading that
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to sterilize the loop,
allow it to cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting that cooling, I can't stress that
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Streak through the original area and
spread cultures using that same zigzag
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern on only one portion of the petri
dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat this process, dragging through for
most recent streak you left off on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here was our initial streak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can see our next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We dragged through that initial one and
the zigzag pattern again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resteralized the loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleaned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it back down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went through that initial streak and again
back and forth, back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a way to help ensure we're
spreading that bacteria and spreading it
[SPEAKER_00]: out well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be gone into what's
called a T-streak, which is kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: formal term for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very common pattern used in
microbiology labs because it looks like a
[SPEAKER_00]: T.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll zigzag back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll end here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll go through and you'll drag
through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll kind of go through another area and
re-sterilize the loop into a third time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here is our initial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We dragged through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another spreading and then a third.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it comes out properly, it'll look like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great when you're looking at
isolating bacteria and individual
[SPEAKER_00]: colonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This then allows you to pick those
colonies and then transfer it and multiply
[SPEAKER_00]: it on another plate at a later date.
It's a very common pattern used in
microbiology labs.
