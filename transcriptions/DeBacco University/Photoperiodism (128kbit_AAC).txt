[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to investigate the
topic of photoperiodism.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this is, is the impact that day
length can have on the flowering of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have certain plants that are called
short-day plants and certain ones called
[SPEAKER_00]: long-day plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to investigate what causes
plants to flower and when.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, the purpose of flowering,
just in the general sense, is the goal is
[SPEAKER_00]: to allow the plants to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: This needs to happen in sync with
pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants want to be in sync with their
pollinators, because if they're not,
[SPEAKER_00]: then these bees will be able to transfer
the pollen and that individual will not be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poinsettia plants and chrysanthemums are
short-day plants, with poinsettias
[SPEAKER_00]: requiring even longer nights or,
when thinking about it, shorter days to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why typically we see these grown
and produce their vibrant colors in the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lilies, for example, are long-day plants
and they flower in the spring as the
[SPEAKER_00]: nights shorten in the days of length.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's investigate these short and long-day
plants a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first part is, plants are being able
to perceive this long and short days.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they tell time?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have two different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytochromes are leaf pigments that enable
plants to sense light and dark periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps the plant determine the
photoperiodism, which is plants' response
[SPEAKER_00]: to the length of light and darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phytochrome system is a biologically
inactive form of the phytochrome,
[SPEAKER_00]: or PR, is converted to the biologically
active form called PFR, as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under illumination with red light,
far-red light and darkness convert this
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule back to the inactive form.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, far-red light is referring to
light that's kind of beyond the 700
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of getting out of the area
where we can see normal, visible light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a little bit of lower of energy,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This active form, in periods of darkness,
will transfer over into the PR,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the inactive form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we can use far-red light to help make
that process go quicker, or we can use red
[SPEAKER_00]: light to help create an inactive to an
active form very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: These changes is initiating this cellular
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at this again here,
our phytochromes in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have both the active and inactive
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, the inactive form is the PR,
and it's converted into the active form
[SPEAKER_00]: when it absorbs red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here, here's our inactive PR form,
absorbing red light, particularly in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 660 nanometers, converted to PFR.
[SPEAKER_00]: The active form of the phytochrome,
the PFR, is broken down into the inactive
[SPEAKER_00]: form when it absorbs red light,
we see here, for a quick conversion,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the active form can gradually revert
back to the inactive form in the absence
[SPEAKER_00]: of light, or that darkness period.
[SPEAKER_00]: This transfers that occurs here,
this slower version back to the inactive,
[SPEAKER_00]: is how plants can help tell the length of
night that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, again, how they tell time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can trick them with different lights,
but naturally, when the sun sets,
[SPEAKER_00]: our active PFRs are slowly going to
convert to PRs, the inactive form.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant will simply measure this and be
able to tell how long it's been night.
[SPEAKER_00]: One key important factor to all of this is
that plants classicize short or long day
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, however, the critical factor to
determining their activity is night
[SPEAKER_00]: length.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we use the term short day and long
day, plants can only determine the length
[SPEAKER_00]: of time of continuous darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how they're telling time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an important aspect because this
can help influence or impact plants'
[SPEAKER_00]: abilities to sense the length of the quote
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, they're only able to determine the
length of night.
[SPEAKER_00]: A way to think about this is as soon as
the sun sets, plants start to stopwatch.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they see light, as soon as the
sun rises, they stop that stopwatch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look at that amount, and they're able
to then tell whether it's a short day or a
[SPEAKER_00]: long day, but they're only able to tell
the length of continuous darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put this in a graphical format.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be easier to understand here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at our short day plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They flower when days are short.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to think about this is if days are
short, well, the night period is longer
[SPEAKER_00]: than what we call the critical length.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our short day plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that the night was short,
meaning a long day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants do not flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The short day plants' PFR inhibits
flowering, and hence, flowering requires
[SPEAKER_00]: low levels of PFR, resulting in long
nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our critical length, and here's our
long night now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That long night equates to a short day,
and the plant will flower because the
[SPEAKER_00]: night time, or the length of night,
the length of continuous darkness was
[SPEAKER_00]: greater than the critical length.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it gets a little confusing here is
where we have a long night, but in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle, for whatever reason, we have a
flash of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice the plant doesn't flower during
this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because plants see a long night of
uninterrupted night light.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, remember, plants have that
stopwatch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start the stopwatch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, light comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stop that stopwatch, and they look at
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's less than the critical length,
and they restart again, and they count
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and they look at it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they won't flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a summation in total.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to have continuous hours of
darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that evident here, that
continuous hours of darkness is greater
[SPEAKER_00]: than the critical length.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we have that little burst of light,
and that's causing them not to flower
[SPEAKER_00]: because each of these parts is less than
the critical length.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, they don't flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Short day plants really mean long night
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These short day plants, require periods of
darkness to be greater than the
[SPEAKER_00]: uninterrupted critical period.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants traditionally will not flower
during the summer months when night
[SPEAKER_00]: lengths are short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horticulturists, though, can trigger
flowering in these plants by covering the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants with an opaque black cloth for
about 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chrysanthemums are an example of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone wants them to bloom at the right
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what botanists can do is simply block
out the light, causing the night to be
[SPEAKER_00]: longer in this case, and causing the
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in comparison to our long day
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see, again, that comparison
between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to discuss these now and
hopefully provide a little bit of an
[SPEAKER_00]: example between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our long day plants, they flower when
days are long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they require a night period to be less
than the critical length.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Night length is shorter than the critical
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: They flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our night length longer than the
critical period.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting here is we have
that burst of light again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this has created now is sections
of continuous darkness to be less than the
[SPEAKER_00]: critical night length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those plants will actually flower
during that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So long day plants, the PFR, activates
flowering, and hence flowering repairs
[SPEAKER_00]: high levels of PFR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this results in the short nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, here we have a long night.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that burst of light in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can call the plant the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of putting it together, hopefully
this picture here makes a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those long days, we see long day plants
require periods of darkness to be less
[SPEAKER_00]: than the uninterrupted critical length.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants will traditionally not flower
during the winter and autumn months when
[SPEAKER_00]: night lengths are long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where colors can trigger flowering in
these plants by exposing the plant to a
[SPEAKER_00]: light source during the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're exposing those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exposing those plants is a bright light in
the middle of the night breaking apart
[SPEAKER_00]: that continuous hours of darkness causing
the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carnations are an example of a long day
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, even though they're listed as
long day and short day plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to keep in mind that plants can
only tell the hours of continuous
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how they're determining whether
they flower or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Short day plants will flower during
periods of long night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long day plants will flower during periods
of a short night.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can influence that with a burst of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're breaking that cycle in the
short day plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're breaking that hours of
continuous darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here with the burst of light causing long
day plants to flower and suppressing
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering in short day plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, there's some things called day
neutral plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these plants will flower independently
of a photo period, but they may require a
[SPEAKER_00]: period of cold in some instances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rice is a prime example of what's called a
day neutral plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll flower regardless of a lengthening
day, a shortening day, a burst of light or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a prime example of a day neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neutral plant.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
