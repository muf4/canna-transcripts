[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
we're going to go over soluble salts
[SPEAKER_00]: importance in a soil test report.
[SPEAKER_00]: This image kind of shows some negative
impacts of high soluble salts here,
[SPEAKER_00]: where this sidewalk has probably been
treated with some salt maybe in the
[SPEAKER_00]: wintertime and here it is the springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see an area here where the grass is
not growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an indication here that the salts
might be really high, preventing this
[SPEAKER_00]: grass from being able to survive and grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into soluble salts importance
in a soil test report.
[SPEAKER_00]: So causes for elevated salt levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to cause this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw previously where it could be
near a walkway, but let's look at this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of from other aspects that could
cause this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, soluble salt levels might be
elevated in areas close to roads,
[SPEAKER_00]: where salt compounds are used for deicing,
where excessive fertilizer has also been
[SPEAKER_00]: applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be in the form of traditional
chemical fertilizer, but also organic
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments as well as such as manure can
also has elevated salt levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some cases, organic amendments may
be added at levels that increase soil salt
[SPEAKER_00]: levels greater than those using commercial
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes to a shock to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone thinks that just the commercial
fertilizer is what's causing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: salts, but keep in mind natural manures
can also contain high levels of salt and
[SPEAKER_00]: if excessively added can cause salt levels
to be higher than those using commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So elevated salt levels impact on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, high soluble salt levels can cause
severe water stress and nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: imbalances in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's causing the water to
essentially leave the root, causing it to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like dehydrate the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So want to keep in mind that we can see
here of control and increasing salt
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a certain point where plants can
become stunted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can become yellowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That root structure will be poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these can lead to reduced harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So salt levels, what do the numbers mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do take a soluble salt level,
what are we looking at as far as numbers?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they kind of translating to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's an electrical conductivity
that's typically given.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see this MMHO over centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is electrical connectivity unit that
stands for millimho per centimeter that
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially measures total salts in
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we're talking for mineral soils,
low saline is considered less than 0.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slightly saline is 0.4 to 0.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might cause some injury in salt
sensitive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moderate saline is 0.81 to 1.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will restrict growth of many plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say restrict growth, reducing root
structure, therefore reducing top growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see any numbers above 1.2,
this will likely result in severe plant
[SPEAKER_00]: damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Levels can be reduced by repeated
rainwater or irrigation is known to be
[SPEAKER_00]: have low EC levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this does not mean it's necessarily
detrimental to the plants forever when you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to go through and dilute those total
salts or basically flush them out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will help them to go back to the
normal levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming you catch this early and salt
levels aren't extremely high and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a very salt sensitive crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep this in mind for those
using commercial fertilizer, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: those which often forget this,
using organic fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well, your salt levels can become
elevated just as easily.
