[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here, we're going to be looking at
determining glass density and what it can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell us about evidence that might be found
at a crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So glass density and refractive index are
both used most successfully in classifying
[SPEAKER_00]: glass particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a class characteristic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to keep this in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an individual characteristic,
it's only a class characteristic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows us only to exclude glass
fragments that may have originated from
[SPEAKER_00]: different sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't tell us it came from the front
window, it can only tell us it came maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: from a window compared to maybe glass that
might be in a canning jar, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a mirror, for example, might be
different types of glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this density can allow us to classify
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at different densities,
or a little chart here of different
[SPEAKER_00]: densities, window glass does not have a
uniform density.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to take some samples from
different locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The edge of tempered glass is denser than
the interior, so keep that in mind if you
[SPEAKER_00]: are looking at tempered glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a database of glass samples
for comparison, so I've just provided you
[SPEAKER_00]: with a couple densities here of various
materials just for the sense of
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind the densest is that flinter
optical glass, and it's got 7.2 grams per
[SPEAKER_00]: centimeters cubed, all the way down to
sand being only 1.52 grams per centimeters
[SPEAKER_00]: cubed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we determine the density,
how do we go about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which type of glass has specific density
to allow for these comparisons to occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: Density, capital D here, is calculated by
dividing the mass divided by the volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that the reason why this
is in a heart, we want to think about kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like M over V.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at the very top here,
the top of the heart kind of looks like an
[SPEAKER_00]: M, and the bottom side here kind of looks
like a V.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an easy way to remember it's
mass over volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to do this by kind of getting
the weighing the substance, getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: mass of the particular glass that we have,
and then the volume is usually found by
[SPEAKER_00]: the displacement method because its shape
tends to be irregular.
[SPEAKER_00]: The formula for calculating density then
can be applied and you can get the density
[SPEAKER_00]: of the glass and that can help you
potentially or at least narrow down what
[SPEAKER_00]: type of glass you have found and are
looking at identifying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the way to do it.
