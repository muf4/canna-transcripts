[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tobacco University video,
we're going to get into how and where are
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting into some really in-depth
scientific research articles as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: which might be a little bit more advanced
than some people may want to know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at least here you can get some good
detailed information, look at some good
[SPEAKER_00]: images, and if you just want the basics,
that'll be provided here also on this
[SPEAKER_00]: video lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the detail on
how and where are cannabinoids produced in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, here's a great research
article that you're welcome to take a look
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: The images will be provided from here,
and again, provided with that extra level
[SPEAKER_00]: of detail than just a quick, simple
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I realize many of you are
probably here for that quick and simple
[SPEAKER_00]: answer, so when we're looking at where
these cannabinoids are produced,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, phyto-cannabinoids are synthesized
in the capote-like stocked granular
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes, or the CSG, as they'll be
referred to, and this is kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: structures that they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the quick answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's all you wanted, you're welcome
to depart from the video at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot more detail to get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I've provided here is some great
images to be able to really look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: details provided in these trichome
structures, and we're looking at light
[SPEAKER_00]: microscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And A and B, so typically what you might
be used to seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking kind of a side shot as well
as looking at like a top-down shot there
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cross-sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're also getting into some SEM,
which is some scanning electron microscope
[SPEAKER_00]: images, which provide great level of
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost looks like something kind of from
space here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing kind of the scale bars to
give you an idea of size.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at some of the definitions
here of all the letters correspond with
[SPEAKER_00]: basically the caption presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go through and read it all,
but it does give you, if you do have an
[SPEAKER_00]: image you're really interested in,
match it up over here, and you can find
[SPEAKER_00]: out some more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little more detail than maybe you want
to understand, but basically trichomes is
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're looking at here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the trichome development to
kind of pull back, if you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: chemist trichomes because as a sessile
glands lacking a stalk, and they start
[SPEAKER_00]: near the surface of the floral or leaf
epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember epidermis like our epidermis is
kind of the outer skin on both the adaxial
[SPEAKER_00]: and adaxial sides, the top and bottom of
the leaf surface and plant surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: These sessile glandotrichomes are present
on the vegetative plant, but they are not
[SPEAKER_00]: expressing the synthesis for cannabinoid
production or monoterpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce primary subsequent terpenes
there, kind of like the early,
[SPEAKER_00]: early stages there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of shows you just some great
images here, really looking at some detail
[SPEAKER_00]: with on the cannabis leaf surface at those
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now production of these cannabinoids will
only occur at certain points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they only occur when the plant reaches
floral maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do these sessile trichomes begin to grow
stalks, kind of see here, and become that
[SPEAKER_00]: CSG kind of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only during this phase does it begin
to produce cannabinoids as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why we don't want to harvest
plants too early because if the trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: are underdeveloped, well, so are the
cannabinoids, so are the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be very low in
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trichome example image, you know,
kind of looking at kind of the large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of more of a zoomed in version.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little crystals on the flower are
actually those caputase stalked
[SPEAKER_00]: glandotrichomes, those CSGs, which sparkle
when they catch the light, especially when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the structures we really want to
be careful with as far as avoid damaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can kind of see that zoomed in version
right here of how the density of the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes is quite high in this particular
image.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these CSGs, close up picture here,
within the glands are secondary metabolite
[SPEAKER_00]: excretions, which are the primary,
the cannabinoids are going to be present
[SPEAKER_00]: in these structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these are raised structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are three dimensional.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to do any damage to these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why that handling of the final
dried flower is so delicate and important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, more detailed images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I think these are also great to
kind of give you that kind of really
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced level look at some trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at the flowers here and
are kind of staying in different images.
[SPEAKER_00]: These stalked granular trichomes have
mature cannabis flowers, have a
[SPEAKER_00]: proliferation of cells in their secretory
discs, looking at kind of the interior
[SPEAKER_00]: portions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These sessile trichomes with greater than
eight gland cells will develop these CSGs
[SPEAKER_00]: and are typically located on the calyx,
which is the structure of the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only CSG trichomes produce cannabinoids
and monoterpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important we have as many of
those as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since they're the only structures
responsible for producing the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: For looking at the details of these
images, again, you're kind of not looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the side, you're kind of looking at the
top and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see the kind of description
provided here for all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it also provides a little bit
more of a macroscopic image in
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciation for the level of detail
provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's granular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, looking at another great kind of
detailed image there of some of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: These granular trichomes exhibit distinct
intrinsic inflorescence and metabolite
[SPEAKER_00]: organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: CSGs develop from those sessile granular
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're seeing some side shots as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sessile trichomes produce predominantly
the terpenes, these subsequent terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: and minimal cannabinoids and produce red
auto fluorescence that we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CSGs produce cannabinoids and
monoterpenes and produce blue auto
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescence that we kind of see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that staining also goes through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see them kind of average intensity
here of our intrinsic fluorescence in
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes, different wavelengths being
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see the degree and there are some
variations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's just, this is a
perfect curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some degree of variations there,
but just to kind of get an appreciation
[SPEAKER_00]: for different wavelengths, average
intensity here and the intrinsic
[SPEAKER_00]: inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we're looking at the images,
some great images, some great really
[SPEAKER_00]: detailed images, again, the kind of
caption provided here below to provide you
[SPEAKER_00]: some of that detail as presented in that
research article to kind of show you that
[SPEAKER_00]: level of advanced level of complexity
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another kind of morphological kind of
look here, these SEM images, scanning
[SPEAKER_00]: electron microscope images, really
detailed images of the morphology of three
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of granular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have again, D, E and F here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the stocked sessile and then the
bulbous located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind we are looking at the
epidermis there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at structures that are
raised from the epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unique features of these particular
trichomes, we can kind of see image right
[SPEAKER_00]: here, the cannabis CSG trichomes are
responsible for cannabinoid and
[SPEAKER_00]: monoterpene biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the sites where those are being
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does require gland cells and a
secretory cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within those structures, what you're
looking at, you know, that cloudy
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance, their amber appearance or
clear appearance, this is kind of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on inside of those regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's genetic mechanisms regulating the
biochemical and morphological changes that
[SPEAKER_00]: occur during the CSG trichome development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really they're not that well
understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that they occur, but not really
well understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an area great for future scientific
research to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can kind of see the location really
close to the eight disc cells here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we see that building of that
initial stock and that true stock
[SPEAKER_00]: developed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's what's occurring within here that
the plant is regulating that development
[SPEAKER_00]: of those cannabinoids as well as those
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So exactly the genes that were responsible
for that, again, not well understood,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a great area here for scientific
discovery going forward in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's just kind of a zoomed out
version of kind of a granular trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, occurring on that leaf surface,
these Cecil Glanier trichomes have
[SPEAKER_00]: secretory vesicles encapsulated by a waxy
cuticle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind the outside portion of plants
is waxy, lipid based and has to be water
[SPEAKER_00]: repellent, much like our own skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We produce a lot of oils and lipids very
water repellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This waxy cuticle will contain several
smaller vesicles, which are extracellular
[SPEAKER_00]: components separated by apoplastic space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of getting that development
of these three dimensional structures
[SPEAKER_00]: within or on top of that epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire vesicle apparatus is attached
to a rosette of gland cells, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves connected to the rosette of
striped cells, which are connected to a
[SPEAKER_00]: basal cell, which is connected to the
stock cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're having these multiple kind of
building blocks to create that stocked
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stock contains cells, which are
designed to pump substrates into the
[SPEAKER_00]: secretory cell rosette, which again,
in this area up here, where typically
[SPEAKER_00]: growers are looking to be, whether it's
cloudy or amber color, this is the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: location they're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are they looking to coloration change?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's some indication to when
the cannabinoids are being produced within
[SPEAKER_00]: those glanier trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now hopefully if you stuck together this
long, our last little bit here,
[SPEAKER_00]: our secretory cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plastids within the secretory cells
produce the CBGA and terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are then transported through the
cell wall into the secretory vesicles
[SPEAKER_00]: where they form all we're described as
high lean areas, which form secretory
[SPEAKER_00]: vesicles in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: These little bubbles are where the
secondary metabolites are synthesized and
[SPEAKER_00]: then stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBGA is produced in the secretory cell
plastid and then exported into the
[SPEAKER_00]: secretory vesicle for further manipulation
by proteins called synthases, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at enzymes, all occurring in that
one little top bulbous category there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most growers just look at, is it cloudy,
is it clear?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot going on in that region,
a lot more than I think most growers
[SPEAKER_00]: realize and maybe appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully future scientific discoveries
can unlock some of the pathways here so we
[SPEAKER_00]: can better understand exactly what's going
on in these trichome structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
