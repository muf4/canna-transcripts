[SPEAKER_00]: You might be familiar with DNA structure
being this double helix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get into a little bit more
detail of just explaining the structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: or what does this actually, what are some
of the components that give DNA this
[SPEAKER_00]: double helical structure?
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the discovery of the
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, DNA specifically is made of
nucleotides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each nucleotide has a five carbon sugar,
as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a phosphate group, which has a
negative charge, and then an organic base,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case based on nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, discovering the structure of DNA,
there's two main types, or two
[SPEAKER_00]: classifications of these nucleotides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the large bases, the purines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're known as adenine and guanine,
abbreviated with the letter A and G.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have apuramidines.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are smaller bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice these only have one ring,
and the purines have two.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purines only have one ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's cytosine and thiamine,
assuming we're talking about DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: For RNA, we got to remember uracil is only
found in RNA, and thiamine is only found
[SPEAKER_00]: in DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cysteine is found in both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's important to remember is that a
purine will always bind with a pyrimidine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to see exactly how that
occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our purine binding with this
pyrimidine, how does this look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's an adenine with a thiamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: A binds with T.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have two hydrogen bonds between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: G and C will bind together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guanine and cytosine have three hydrogen
bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they hold their structure just a little
bit stronger than between A and T.
[SPEAKER_00]: How I try to remember it is G and C both
have these kind of semicircle curves to
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would fit together very nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a stronger bond because they
have three hydrogen bonds versus adenine
[SPEAKER_00]: and thiamine only having two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, this is about DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look back for a second,
adenine binding with thiamine,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, adenine would bind with uracil if we
were talking a double-stranded RNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: which does occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, ribose compared to deoxyribose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at the second carbon for H and OH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is kind of the area we're
looking at comparing ribose with
[SPEAKER_00]: deoxyribose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So deoxy simply means without oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has just a hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ribose has an OH group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, ribose stands for, is responsible for
RNA, which is ribonucleic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: deoxyribose DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here with DNA, we see that kind of
second carbon there, deoxy without oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's ribose.
[SPEAKER_00]: With oxygen, we can see that oxygen atom
right here in the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, key observations about DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosalind Franklin uses X-ray diffraction
experiments to reveal that DNA had the
[SPEAKER_00]: shape of a coiled spring or a helix.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of looking top down at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see kind of that coiled
appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of put it in that 3D rotation,
but this image is kind of looking down and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of give the first indication
that DNA may be this spring look or this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of helical shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watson and Crick get the accolades for
kind of developing the double helix
[SPEAKER_00]: official structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They based a lot of it off of Rosalind
Franklin's research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Watson and Crick kind of came up with
this idea and they used kind of finger toy
[SPEAKER_00]: models to kind of develop this structure
that it was this helical shape,
[SPEAKER_00]: this double helix component.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, two strands of DNA are held together
by weak hydrogen bonds and they have
[SPEAKER_00]: complementary pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, appearing in a
permanent binding together, those are
[SPEAKER_00]: example of complementary base pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A binds with T and G binds with C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are complements to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here, G binding with C and A
binding with T, two bonds and three
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I talk about that complement,
we're talking about the original sequence
[SPEAKER_00]: and the other sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it is not an identical sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a complement.
[SPEAKER_00]: A binds with T, T binds with A,
A binds with T, G and C.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I mean by when I say a
complement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each chain is complementary or a mirror
image of one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either it can be used as a template
when a DNA goes to produce itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, through that process of
replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, working with DNA, there's many
different ways scientists will work with
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's PCR, Plumice Chain Reaction
Amplification, where we're upregulating a
[SPEAKER_00]: small section of DNA to be used and run
through potentially a gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: In DNA fingerprinting, used to identify
particular individuals or specific
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences within a genome.
