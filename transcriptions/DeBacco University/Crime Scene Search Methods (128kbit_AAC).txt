[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here in this Debaco University
video, we're going to be looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: crime scene search methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple pictured here to give you
a general idea of the pattern you should
[SPEAKER_00]: be going through, but we're going to look
at this in a little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, when conducting a search,
it's the whole point of conducting a
[SPEAKER_00]: search is for evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This must be thorough and systematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not want to make assumptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to consider any pertinent
evidence and do not overlook little
[SPEAKER_00]: details because failure to do so can lead
to accusations and negligence or covering
[SPEAKER_00]: up evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't want to kind of like look up
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to assume there's just three
because we look on kind of the other side
[SPEAKER_00]: over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like there's four.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be trying to impartial but also
thorough systematic in detail oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now field evidence technicians are the
person responsible for conducting the
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence search.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're mainly looking for fingerprints,
footprints, tool marks, hairs,
[SPEAKER_00]: fibers, and also possible trace evidence
carriers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should also be photographed in the
crime scene documented because this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: really important part, especially
depending on the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: This searching for evidence is a critical
part for any scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now before the search can even begin,
before we even get to that stage of
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for that evidence, we want to
ensure the scene is controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also includes briefing all searchers
involved, establish the speed and areas of
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone kind of has a game plan going
in or hopefully a limited number of
[SPEAKER_00]: people, but so even those that are in
there, so no one interferes with anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one else's area in their searching.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to determine a starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to establish a command post.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to maintain communication between
all people involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to ensure if anything comes up that
everyone is aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to rotate people through areas to
ensure more than one person looks at each
[SPEAKER_00]: area to reduce the chance that a detail is
missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's going to probably miss some
little detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to have a ton of people
going in there, but having someone go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and do a second sweep of an area
is definitely well advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these search patterns, so exactly how
you're going to search a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's something called a spiral
search method and this starts at an outer
[SPEAKER_00]: point and gradually moves toward the
center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it could start at an inner point and
move outward from that center as we kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of see the images here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on the room, depending on the
area, depending on the scene may influence
[SPEAKER_00]: what type of search method you use,
but this is one example and this is called
[SPEAKER_00]: a spiral search here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now moving on from a spiral search,
we also have a grid method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the grid method scene is divided into
grid and each grid is segmented in the
[SPEAKER_00]: search just as the name implies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have this kind of very boxy like look
and you're searching and focusing on those
[SPEAKER_00]: different boxes within that overall grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to a line search, which is
crime scene divided into strips and each
[SPEAKER_00]: strip is searched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this could be based on limiting
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just another search pattern that
can be used line or parallel search here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into what we call a zone
search and this is a quadrant search.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zone search kind of has similar properties
to the grid method, but in this case the
[SPEAKER_00]: scene is divided into quadrants in each
quadrant in search.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit broader based here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is again more important documenting
where North is involved to know where the
[SPEAKER_00]: zones are actually located in a room and
what evidence might be found in those
[SPEAKER_00]: areas or how that room might be set up can
influence whether this one is selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The search pattern selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, kind of those are the
general overview about how we actually go
[SPEAKER_00]: about selecting or determining which one
we're going to use is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can come down to the size,
type of location of the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it an indoor location or is it an
outdoor location?
[SPEAKER_00]: How big is it if it's an indoor compared
to an outdoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of trees in the outdoors,
an open park, things to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the personnel and equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: What equipment is needed and what do you
have access to?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we all like to have the ideal
amount, but a lot of times we're limited
[SPEAKER_00]: and restricted, so that's going to
influence what search we may select.
[SPEAKER_00]: The type of crime that was committed,
if we can establish that or have an idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of that early on, this can impact the type
of evidence that's going to be collected
[SPEAKER_00]: and that can also influence what pattern
you choose so you can be most effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now evidence from the victim themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be collected by a medical
examiner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evidence often includes from the actual
victim would be fiber from their clothing,
[SPEAKER_00]: hair from their head and pubic areas,
blood, hand swabs for gunpowder if that
[SPEAKER_00]: was suspected to be part of the crime,
and also photographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a lot of information just from
the victim, never mind the surrounding
[SPEAKER_00]: area as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep these in mind when we're kind
of going through and establish and search
[SPEAKER_00]: a crime scene to be effective and
efficient because it is only a one-time
[SPEAKER_00]: shot at getting that evidence undisturbed.
