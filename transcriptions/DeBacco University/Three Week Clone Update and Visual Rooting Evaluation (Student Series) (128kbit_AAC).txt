[SPEAKER_00]: All right, welcome to this Tobacco
University student series video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be taking a look at
three-week-old clones, giving you an
[SPEAKER_00]: update as well as a visual evaluation of
their roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you can tell by the image,
it turned out quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so before I get into the
three-week clone update and visual root
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluation, I just want to give you some
background information here very briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, there was a light change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went from a fluent spider plus 660-watt
LED to the Agrobright Designer T5s running
[SPEAKER_00]: at 260 watts, and those are fluorescents,
and we see both of those in the image
[SPEAKER_00]: right here, and links down below for more
information on both of those lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, just kind of the clone age
comparison did have some difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: age.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the three-week-old clones here
on the left that you can see in the cloner
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of the zoomed-in images here,
and then week-and-a-half-old clones here
[SPEAKER_00]: on the right, just so you can see the
difference between that week-and-a-half to
[SPEAKER_00]: three-week-old clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, the water conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were basically left untouched for
about the three weeks there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the pH really needed some slight
adjustment after some more water was added
[SPEAKER_00]: because you want to make sure you're
keeping that at the proper height for the
[SPEAKER_00]: cloner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's get into the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an update since the last time
we've came and seen our clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much since the last time we
switched out our lights from the Fluence
[SPEAKER_01]: LED lights to some fluorescent lights from
Agrobright.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be taking a live comparison
of our LED versus fluorescent lights to
[SPEAKER_01]: show you why we opted to use our
fluorescent lights for our clones rather
[SPEAKER_01]: than the more intensive LED lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at plant level here, I'm reading at
240.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now remember, we have two of our lights
off up here, so only four of our lights
[SPEAKER_01]: are going, but 200 is a perfect level for
clones of this size versus, at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: plant level, an 800-par meter rating over
on this side with our LED lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there is no reason to really have this
much light penetrating our baby clones
[SPEAKER_01]: here, so it would make much more sense to
opt for the 200-par reading as opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: 800.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also took some more clones from
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were taken about a week and a half
ago in comparison to the original ones we
[SPEAKER_01]: took three weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at our monitor for our
conductivity and pH, we're seeing that our
[SPEAKER_01]: conductivity is at 710, which is a little
high, but it's good enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our pH is at 7.1, which is a little more
basic than how we would like it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could add some of our pH down to
make it more acidic and maybe bring it
[SPEAKER_01]: down to a good 6.6.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're going to check our clones to see
how well they're rooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, this side is a lot more
developed than this side, and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: because these have been developing for
about a week and a half more than these
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to have to wait and see.
