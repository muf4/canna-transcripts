[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, a lot of times you'll hear where I
was talking about pH and maintaining pH or
[SPEAKER_00]: checking for pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because it's very important to
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does it impact plants so much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this kind of graph right here is
very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll look at this in a little bit more
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, why is it important to
agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, pH impacts nutrient availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some nutrients become unavailable to
plants at low or high pH levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a soil range, an extreme soil
range of pH of 4 to pH of 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thicker the bar is, the more
available that nutrient is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here in this blue, this slightly
acidic kind of column here, that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: we typically like to keep most pHs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now notice if we kind of follow down this
range, most nutrients are available in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's important to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at nitrogen, for example,
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we get a pH kind of below 6,
especially 5.5, its availability becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: much less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing as if we get that pH soil above
8, the nitrogen in soil inherently becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: less available to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the opposite here with some
nutrients that are more for acidic loving
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, boron, very thick here,
and to 5, still maintains very thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, if we're a pH 8 or above,
becomes a lot less available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron is kind of like the opposite triangle
here, where once we get a below pH of
[SPEAKER_00]: around that 6, 2 to 6 and lower,
we see it's a maximum amount availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But molybdenum is kind of the opposite,
where it's more available at a basic
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants such as blueberries that like
that more acidic range, well, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: liking the iron in particular,
and some copper, and some of the metals
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why pH is so important,
because you can see over different ranges
[SPEAKER_00]: how these nutrients availability is
greatly impacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's how it kind of looks on the
large scale, because the pH can determine
[SPEAKER_00]: the amendments that need to be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can indicate if it's advantageous or
nested.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's necessary to adjust pH level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes if there's nutrient
deficiencies or nutrient issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: one, it could be low amounts of that
present in the soil, or it could be low
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of that nutrient available to
plants in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes simply adding lime or sulfur
to correct pH can correct nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies, because those nutrients that
are already present in the soil become
[SPEAKER_00]: plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why pH is so important.
