[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to explore
aeroponics, which is a form of
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it can take on many forms,
I think utilizing the EasyClone cloning
[SPEAKER_00]: system is a great example of aeroponics,
because this is a true form and it is used
[SPEAKER_00]: for the cloning process, but this same
form can be used to grow plants for longer
[SPEAKER_00]: term than just cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now aeroponics system offers the highest
performance possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of the EasyClone setup where we have
a water reservoir here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a water pump going to a spray bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Creating these jets of water that come out
and fall down back in the reservoir and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of recirculate through.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, there's no growing media used
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are simply supported by this
foam here and in the cloning operation,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no roots initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the roots will be allowed to form here
through the constant spraying of water and
[SPEAKER_00]: also allows some form of aeration of that
area as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here's some recent clones on
the left and some older clones on the
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes because this is a cloning
operation with no roots, they will start
[SPEAKER_00]: to yellow a little bit, but oftentimes
once they start to develop roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will start to green back up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now roots are suspended in a dark row
chamber, that's down in here, inside this
[SPEAKER_00]: EasyClone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a nutrient solution constantly
being sprayed to create a continual spray
[SPEAKER_00]: of that nutrient solution on those newly
developing roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air is also present to allow the roots to
breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why this can become a very
efficient system here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall is that the roots' growth can
limit its ability to spray to come into
[SPEAKER_00]: contact with the growing roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as those roots become denser and
clump together, when there's initially
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of one or two, there's a lot of
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, as those become denser and start
to grow, one can kind of reduce the spray
[SPEAKER_00]: contact of the other roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another downfall is if the pump fails,
the entire system can be lost,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you are dependent on that water pump
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always good to keep it in an area where
you can constantly hear it, or always
[SPEAKER_00]: check on it multiple times during the day
if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it was to go out, you could catch
that immediately and not risk losing all
[SPEAKER_00]: of your plants growing under this
aeroponic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's a beneficial system for cloning,
as we see here, the clones also have a
[SPEAKER_00]: water monitor here, keeping and assessing
the conditions, in addition to a ceramic
[SPEAKER_00]: metal halide light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is great for cloning,
but often full season growth is not
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended, especially for large scale
production facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this system is dependent on
electricity 100% of the time, so that also
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be taken into consideration so
that we're not having any sort of pump
[SPEAKER_00]: failures leading to the entire loss of the
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
