[SPEAKER_00]: I think this title presents a question
that a lot of people have, and that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, what is cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to look at and investigate
a little bit of the background for what
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis actually is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what does the name mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Illegis cannabis is probably indigenous to
the wet habits of the Asiatic continent
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably likely where it was
originated or grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple of links here for some
sources if you want to go ahead and take a
[SPEAKER_00]: look at some of the information that I
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to present a summary of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where did cannabis originate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cannabis has a long coexisted with
mankind, which led to early domestication
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's shown up in a lot of old records.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been around human interactions for
a very long period of time because
[SPEAKER_00]: probably one reason why it's been around
is it's diverse amount of uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be used as textiles for fibers
such as hemp, clothing, or in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: a hemp bag, also on narcotic or
psychoactive compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of serves potentially two
different purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's the difference between
cannabis, hemp, and marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very kind of key and
important distinction here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, the plant is tall with a stiff
upright stem divided into serrated leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: and these collateral hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used to produce hemp fiber and also a
psychotropic drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, specifically hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is kind of a broad category
that includes both hemp and marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp, specifically, the cannabis plant
grown for fiber or other non-psychoactive
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically has a high medical value due to
the CBDs, which the cannabinoid produced,
[SPEAKER_00]: and needs to have less than 0.3% THC to be
federally classified as hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a plant called marijuana may look
very similar to hemp and almost
[SPEAKER_00]: indistinguishable.
[SPEAKER_00]: What defines it as marijuana is a cannabis
plant that is high in THC and is currently
[SPEAKER_00]: federally legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So THC is that psychoactive cannabinoid
that gets you the typical, what's
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with cannabis or marijuana is
the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp is at less than 0.3% THC and
typically grown for its fiber or its
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal CBD value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hemp and marijuana are both classified
as cannabis hemp is going to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: by far, our focus here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, current or modern cannabis is
represented by many cultivated varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: that are often unstable taxonomic
foundations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll hear these names, for example,
some called Green Crack, all these crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: names, very unstable taxonomic
foundations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The names are very variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets into how do we name cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, an application of the taxon system
to the genus cannabis together with sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: and indica distinctions should be avoided.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sativa and indica, not really a great
correlation to the plant, may indicate the
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology of the plant, but doesn't go
much beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole goal here is kind of to use the
International Code for Nomenclature for
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivated Plants abbreviated the ICNCP.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not mandatory to use specific
epithets, so sativa or indica or a
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of the genus name and cultivar
epithet in any language and bound by
[SPEAKER_00]: single quotation marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an example would be cannabis and then
in single quotation marks would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar that would be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this defines the name of that cannabis
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been literally hundreds of
cannabis cultivated varieties developed
[SPEAKER_00]: and named by medical patients and also
recreational users.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall to utilizing or adopting this
system is that few of these have been
[SPEAKER_00]: treated as the real cannabis cultivars and
having been regularly named and registered
[SPEAKER_00]: according to the proper channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the names such as seer super lemon,
big bud, the green crack, skywalker,
[SPEAKER_00]: are all kind of just names used by
recreational users and really don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: any core meaning as far as the proper way
to name a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lack of a standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is causing a major issue,
particularly with marijuana strains that
[SPEAKER_00]: lack an adequate description.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this reason, their names cannot be
accepted as cultivar epithets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any strain that has not been formally
described as a cultivar, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: the so-called sour diesel, should be named
as follows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis strain sour diesel with their
popularized name without single quotation
[SPEAKER_00]: marks, having in mind that their names
have no taxonomical validity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because sour diesel is a very
common high THC form of cannabis on the
[SPEAKER_00]: East Coast, really that names is kind of
tossed around and doesn't have that true
[SPEAKER_00]: taxonomical background because there's a
lack of a standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So see here a bud of sour diesel,
here's a bud of argo blackberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really these names are just kind of out
there and used, but aren't really
[SPEAKER_00]: scientifically backed.
Thank you.
