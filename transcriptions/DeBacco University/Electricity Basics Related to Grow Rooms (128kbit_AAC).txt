[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so when looking at setting up a grow
room, typically there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity involved around lights and
fans and cooling, heating and monitoring
[SPEAKER_00]: devices, so you want to be well versed in
electricity basics related to supporting
[SPEAKER_00]: that grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, basics of circuits will
depend on the lights and electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment chosen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll impact the total capacity that
that room will need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically a 15 or 20 amp electrical
circuit will be necessary for common
[SPEAKER_00]: household 120 volt systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind if you're buying balusters,
typically the 120 volt and also the 240.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're buying a 240 system,
you want to make sure that you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate connections for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Average households run on 120.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful to calculate your power needs,
so no circuit should run over 80% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stated rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's make it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a 10 amp circuit, 80% of that
would be 8 amps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a 20 amp circuit would be running at no
more than 16 amps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have that little bit of a
buffer effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a 20 amp circuit, you don't want
to run it all the way to 20 amps there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now know what your electrical equipment
draws in amps, so it's a system of
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the labels, make sure your circuit
boxes can handle it, make sure you're
[SPEAKER_00]: separating everything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy to plug things in,
but you've got to account for what those
[SPEAKER_00]: draw.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all your electrical components,
know what it draws in amps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add these numbers up and determine that
you're not overloading the circuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you keep adding something,
you keep adding one more thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: one more thing, one more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very easy to overdraw in amps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assume everything's going to be running at
the same time to create a worst-case
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you may say, well, my lights are
going to come off, and then this is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to come on, and then those are going to go
off, and that's going to consider a
[SPEAKER_00]: worst-case scenario, just in case
everything does go on or is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to run into issues there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be plugging into GFI outlets.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are ground fault interrupter
certified outlets, and these are typically
[SPEAKER_00]: installed where high humidity conditions
or where water environment would be,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as near a sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means each has its own built-in
breaker to cut power.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the short, and they can be tested,
see this little red dot here, or these
[SPEAKER_00]: little buttons that you can push to make
sure they're functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little light here will indicate the green
light indicates it's on and functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you'll also be able to note,
while these are important, should be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a system to check these,
because they can trip unexpectedly,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so be sure to check them so you don't
suddenly lose power to an outlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each should be this typical three-pronged
outlet component so that you are also
[SPEAKER_00]: accounting for the ground wire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, to these outlets, we're
plugging in extension cords.
[SPEAKER_00]: Running extension cords long distance,
though, is not as advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, all extension cords are not
considered equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a mess in this little box here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When purchasing extension cords,
get the shortest that you need to complete
[SPEAKER_00]: the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have a bunch of coiled, leftover
extension cords.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to get the smallest gauge or
the thickest wire possible to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance and chance of fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, this is going to come at
increased cost, but it is well worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gauge of wire, this throws a lot of
people off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thicker the gauge, as you can see
here, the thicker the gauge, the smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: the number.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're buying, for example,
comparing a 14 gauge wire to a 10 gauge
[SPEAKER_00]: wire, that 10 gauge wire is going to be
much thicker than that 14 gauge.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 21 gauge would be really, really thin
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: An 8 gauge would be really thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it sometimes is counterintuitive
where the smaller the number, the larger
[SPEAKER_00]: the gauge, and that will help reduce the
chance of fire, reduce the heating,
[SPEAKER_00]: and allow you to be able to run longer
distances if you need to, even though you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to try to keep them to a minimum.
Thanks for watching, and have a great day.
See you next time.
