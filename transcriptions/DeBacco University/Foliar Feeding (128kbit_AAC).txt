[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here looking at foliar feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this, just as the name implies,
involves feeding the leaves or feeding the
[SPEAKER_00]: foliage of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go over a little bit about
some of the basics of this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, it involves the simple act
of applying fertilizer on the actual leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often diluted application rates of 1 to
100 or greater are often suggested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything higher concentration than that
when you're applying it to the leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending again what product you're using,
but you increase the odds of burning the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be mindful when applying
things to the leaves that the odds of
[SPEAKER_00]: burning can increase, and there's ways you
can go about reducing that, and one is
[SPEAKER_00]: through dilution rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now then, it's the equipment you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the finer the water droplet,
the better the coverage the plants will
[SPEAKER_00]: get in the more efficient application of
the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hand pump sprayers are very entry level,
they're easy to get, they're very cost
[SPEAKER_00]: effective, but they tend to produce larger
water droplets.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at misters or foggers,
they're often recommended because of that
[SPEAKER_00]: fine water droplet that they're creating,
increasing the interaction of that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular product and the leaf surface,
which allows it to be taken up much more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at the time of day that you
apply is also an important consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to watch out for periods of high
heat and light intensities, as these can
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the odds of burning the leaves no
matter what product you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically early morning or late evening
for outdoor growers is recommended to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the burning, but also increase the
efficiency due to the higher percentage of
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves in the leaf stomata being open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stomata basically pours in the leaf,
and if they're open, you can get that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular product that you're applying
into the leaf a lot more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned this is for outdoor growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early morning, we're looking at for indoor
growers, we're looking at soon before
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe lights come on, or definitely at
least not during peak lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe just kind of before they come on,
or just after they go off, maybe other
[SPEAKER_00]: options for indoor growers to maximize
foliar feeding and minimize the damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also for foliar feeding, you can use
spreaders and stickers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a spreader is, is it reduces the
surface tension to allow for the applied
[SPEAKER_00]: products to reduce flat droplets to
increase the amount of leaf surface
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally, if this is a normal water
droplet, it spreads that out to create
[SPEAKER_00]: that nice interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, here's our entire
product, we're only having this level of
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're having ideally the same volume
of water, but a lot greater interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the extreme example here,
where we're having again that minimum
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction, that spreader will help
spread that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because leaves have a waxy surface
to them, which is hydrophobic,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is repelling the water, so the
spreader helps kind of negate some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: negatives of the polar compounds of water
and helps spread them out to increase that
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also something called stickers,
and these reduce the chance of water
[SPEAKER_00]: splash from washing off the plant leaf
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: It literally will help them adhere or
stick to the leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a spreader-sticker
combination, then only you're getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: higher contact of our spreader,
but this sticker is actually making it
[SPEAKER_00]: adhere to the leaves a little bit more
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: The benefits of these spreader-stickers,
again, help increase the contact between
[SPEAKER_00]: the liquid and the leaf surface,
makes the products more effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be a great way to maximize that
use of the product and ensure that that
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf is getting a very even coverage
throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the drawbacks is some products
are not recommended to be mixed with
[SPEAKER_00]: spreader-stickers, so know what product
you're using and know if there is any
[SPEAKER_00]: potential negative interactions with
adding such product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spreader-stickers can make some products
work what's called too well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It increases the odds of burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if you're using a
spreader-sticker, you're going to want to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase that dilution rate a little bit
more and cut back on maybe go with a very
[SPEAKER_00]: small amount or smaller amount as you work
your way up to reduce the chance of spray
[SPEAKER_00]: damaging or grower-induced plant leaf
burning through the use of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be effective at increasing,
especially if there's deficiencies,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we want to be mindful of some of the
concerns that are also associated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, this is a little bit more of a
quicker fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be managing the vast majority
of our nutrients through the growing media
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're choosing to use.
Thank you.
