[SPEAKER_00]: So this is intended to be a short tobacco
university video for those considering or
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for the pros and cons of growing
your own cannabis clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are some of the advantages?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are some of the disadvantages?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned and you'll learn about them
here in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the video here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off growing on cannabis clones,
what's the advantage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you want to consider this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you allow you as a grower to know
the source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows you as a grower to also control
the timing of when those clones will be
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to grow into the next stage of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also be known in a consistent
supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to rely on anyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are a lot of the kind of pros or
advantages here that growers seek and why
[SPEAKER_00]: they would consider growing their own
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, with any decision or any decision
you're looking at, there's not always all
[SPEAKER_00]: just positives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the disadvantages if you do decide
to grow your own clones is that the time
[SPEAKER_00]: and resources required or needed to be
devoted to production of those clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's easier just to buy the
clones instead of going through this
[SPEAKER_00]: process of having all these materials and
timing all set.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost of setting up that clone
production has to be weighed to determine
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not that is going to net a
positive yield in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also not only the cost, you also have
to consider the space and environments
[SPEAKER_00]: required to be able to ensure you have the
proper cloning environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a waste of time so that you
actually have good odds of producing
[SPEAKER_00]: quality clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you're thinking about growing
your own clones, hopefully this has
[SPEAKER_00]: provided you with some of the
disadvantages, some of the advantages,
[SPEAKER_00]: and has given you some background so you
can make an educated decision on what you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to implement for your growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
