[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to go over properties
to find good water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for plants, we're typically wanting to
irrigate with good water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what does that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that contain?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go over some of those
properties here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with potable or drinking
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is water that has a high clumbiness
rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the symbol for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what potable means, not only can it be
used for drinking, but it can also be used
[SPEAKER_00]: for cooking or food preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tap water meets the drinking water
standards, but this does not mean all
[SPEAKER_00]: water is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this means is that just because it's
drinking or potable, that means you can
[SPEAKER_00]: drink it, but it doesn't mean that there's
any set standards for exactly what it
[SPEAKER_00]: contains.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certain levels that needs to meet
to be defined as this drinking water,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there could be different levels of
chlorine or cloramide or other kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: properties in it that would still classify
as drinking water, but can have other
[SPEAKER_00]: adverse effects if you're looking at
adding microbes, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good water is critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, what defines that good water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, potable drinking water, as I say,
is a good start, but you're also looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for properties such as, has a neutral pH
around seven, low EC or electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: conductivity, and minimal additives,
such as chlorine, because chlorine is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to kill some microbes and could
cause some other issues with growing
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that would be perfectly fine,
say, for drinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that drinking water,
potable water, is a good place to start,
[SPEAKER_00]: but here's some other properties you
should be checking.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something called gray water,
and this is second grade water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like perfectly clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of got this grayish look to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is typically used for flushing
toilets, but it can also be used for
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you have to use potable or
drinking water for irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gray water is often used for irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if it is used, there can be risks
associated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it needs to be used with caution,
and in different situations, it may be
[SPEAKER_00]: more advantageous than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good, whether it's drinking water,
gray water, or whatever irrigation water
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using, is to get it tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good for multiple tests and multiple
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just take one test at one time and
consider that good for the entire year,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using city water, you can get a
report from the place where you get it
[SPEAKER_00]: from, the municipality.
[SPEAKER_00]: MDC, the Metropolitan District Commission
of Connecticut, is one in the local area
[SPEAKER_00]: here that's great at providing testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the MDC, they prepare water quality
reports annually, provide summaries of
[SPEAKER_00]: past year's water quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: They test 130 potential water
contaminants, reservoirs, treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, 47 state-approved sampling sites
throughout 12 town and service areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they distribute an average of 50
million gallons of water per day to a
[SPEAKER_00]: population of about 400,000 located in the
state of Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've personally just called them up,
and I was able to get a water sample
[SPEAKER_00]: report for water samples that they had
pulled the previous day in my local area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, reach out to where you're
getting your water from if you are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: it from a tap water source.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can provide you with the reports,
not only annual, but sometimes very
[SPEAKER_00]: current.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also test it yourself to ensure
that you have properties that constitute
[SPEAKER_00]: good water.
