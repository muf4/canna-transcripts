[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tobacco University video,
we'll be looking at impacts on insect
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while there are many, we're going to
focus on a few very important key ones
[SPEAKER_00]: here related to forensics to take into
consideration when we're trying to time
[SPEAKER_00]: out the development of certain insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that stages follow a
pattern within insect development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because there's a progression of the
insect life cycle that follows this
[SPEAKER_00]: predictable and known pattern,
as a result the rate of stage transition
[SPEAKER_00]: can be altered by various conditions and
knowing what that alteration may be can
[SPEAKER_00]: allow us to kind of develop an idea of
exactly the time or backtrack that time to
[SPEAKER_00]: when the original first kind of time of
death may have occurred, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: important when investigating crime scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind temperature is kind of one
of the major ones we want to keep track of
[SPEAKER_00]: because insects are ectothermic,
meaning they're cold-blooded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their body temperatures are largely
dictated by the outside temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only when the outside temperature warms
and insects internal body temperature to a
[SPEAKER_00]: critical level can the insect become
active.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's becoming active.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's allowed to do is it can eat and
grow at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that temperature is
something we definitely want to be making
[SPEAKER_00]: note of and potential previous temperature
for looking at multiple days going back in
[SPEAKER_00]: time to try to determine the time of
death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now insects to calculate the post-mortem
interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well insects can be used to estimate the
time between death and discovery of the
[SPEAKER_00]: corpse, which is called the post-mortem
interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: To increase the accuracy temperature data
and identifying the presence of drugs in a
[SPEAKER_00]: corpse in addition to if the corpse was
wrapped in a material and the conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: it was exposed to externally should also
be documented because all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: variables can be kind of factored in to
try to develop the closest possible
[SPEAKER_00]: estimation to that original on point or
time of death.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here definitely how the
incubation temperature and time in hours
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely can have an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keeping in mind knowing the weather
conditions we're talking outside but also
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing the conditions the corpse was in
and the conditions that the corpse was
[SPEAKER_00]: found and was it wrapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example some sort of external wrapping
can also influence this intervals as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now drugs can also impact the presence of
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any drugs present in the corpse at the
time of death can be ingested by the
[SPEAKER_00]: insects themselves and affect the rate of
maggot development.
[SPEAKER_00]: A drug like cocaine speeds up the
development while some poison such as
[SPEAKER_00]: arsenic and glycosides can also slow it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So important to know and identify what
drugs may have been present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see hands of a person being
exposed to arsenic poisoning through
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminated water over an extended period
of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all flies keep in mind are not the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not all fly species are found
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Identifying and document the species is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example the skipper fly is only found
in urban settings and the house and blow
[SPEAKER_00]: flies are flesh flies that can be found in
both urban and rural settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result knowing not only the
general species but also getting to the
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific name can also be important
because the flies aren't all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said oh flies were present.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where an entomologist would come
in and specifically identify that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular fly which been really important
for the investigative process.
