[SPEAKER_00]: Have you considered adding manure tea to
your canvas plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this Tobacco University video will
provide you with some information and some
[SPEAKER_00]: data to look at how applicable this may
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into using manure tea for canvas
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, here's the research article,
and I would invite you to kind of go
[SPEAKER_00]: through, find the article, look at it in
more detail because there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: presented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to provide you again with a
brief overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the study specifics, as far as the
overview of kind of what they went through
[SPEAKER_00]: and looked at, they evaluated the
individual and combined effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial synthetic fertilizer,
humic acids, manure tea, and bioinoculants
[SPEAKER_00]: such as inorganic, organic, and biological
resources respectively on cannabis growth
[SPEAKER_00]: and physiological parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's some pictures of plants from
their study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what were the treatments?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of shows some of the data
table that they provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the two biological fertilizers
was micro grow, which is a Brazilian
[SPEAKER_00]: patented product categories as manure tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So micro geo is this manure tea
specifically that was looked at in this
[SPEAKER_00]: study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bio-fertilizer is composed of organic
components, active endormant cells from
[SPEAKER_00]: various microorganisms, and metabolites
and organo-mineral chelates that are
[SPEAKER_00]: produced through continuous anaerobic
fermentation in a liquid medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at kind of what's
presented here, we can kind of see some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the siting of sources as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that bio-fertilizer category,
which will be focused on the micro geo and
[SPEAKER_00]: micro geo supreme bioinoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is this here?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a water soluble powder containing
several strains of bacteria and fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: including 11 different mycorrhizal species
and microbial foods as well included in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of follow these through
this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what are the effects of these
biological stimulants on cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the micro geo products did increase
shoe in root biomass as this was generally
[SPEAKER_00]: not different from the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this may have been due to the reduced
stress and not the overall improvement of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So important note to make there.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there is still change for
improved CBD content, even though this
[SPEAKER_00]: data was not collected in the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this is showing here is a
different groups and different treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the shoot biomass, the root biomass,
and then the total.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind means within a column
followed by the same letter are not
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly different at the 0.5
probability level of statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could pause the video here and take
a look at some more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely some consistencies
here, sadly not showing a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what were the researchers' general
conclusions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, their general conclusion was the
combination, the combined application of
[SPEAKER_00]: humic acid and bio-fertilizer resulted in
additive but not synergistic increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: the measured parameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What their core ideas was that cannabis
height, chlorophyll, and photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: were affected by bio-fertilizer and humic
acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis biomass was really affected by
the application of bio-fertilizer and or
[SPEAKER_00]: humic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now clear evidence found in the additional
benefits from the combination of
[SPEAKER_00]: bio-fertilizer and humic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, bio stimulants may contribute
to cannabis stress mitigation and
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind if you are growing plants,
and hopefully maintaining their
[SPEAKER_00]: environment so there is not a lot of
stress on the plants, then the really
[SPEAKER_00]: effectiveness of adding some of these bio
stimulants such as manure teas may be
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good if they're in a stressful situation,
but in this case or this study,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're keeping the environment well,
keeping the growing environment very
[SPEAKER_00]: supportive, the effectiveness of these bio
stimulants may be greatly reduced to the
[SPEAKER_00]: point it's not worth the extra labor,
time, and money to add them to your
[SPEAKER_00]: growing operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
