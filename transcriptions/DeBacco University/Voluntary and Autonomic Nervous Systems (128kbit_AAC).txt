[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're looking at the voluntary and
the autonomic nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how this relates and connects to
the central and peripheral nervous
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at down here, our autonomic and
our somatic systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of key here, the green is the
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for our central nervous system,
the main structure is the brain and spinal
[SPEAKER_00]: cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the function of those is to
integrate as control centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking specifically at our autonomic
and our somatic nervous systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is relating to systems that we
have voluntary motor control over and
[SPEAKER_00]: involuntary control over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So voluntary control will be an example of
impulses from the central nervous system
[SPEAKER_00]: going to skeletal muscles for the movement
that we have control over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then involuntary, these would be
muscles such as smooth muscle that do move
[SPEAKER_00]: and do contract, but are not under our
direct control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now specifically, the voluntary nervous
system relays commands to skeletal muscles
[SPEAKER_00]: and can be controlled by conscious
thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, reflexes are rapid involuntary
movements.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're rapid because the sensory neuron
passes information directly to the motor
[SPEAKER_00]: neuron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here at the kind of the knee jerk test
where if you hang your knee over like a
[SPEAKER_00]: chair or a table and take a little hammer
and you hit the tendon just below the knee
[SPEAKER_00]: cap, that will be a prime example of this
process and your leg will kick out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This must involve a single connection to
interneurons between sensory and motor
[SPEAKER_00]: neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, the prime example is here
and you could try this for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, we also have within the
autonomic nervous system, we have two
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a parasympathetic pathway and a
sympathetic pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our parasympathetic nervous system
specifically is relating to controlling
[SPEAKER_00]: normal functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also is related to conservative energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that with reducing heart rate,
stimuli activity of digestive organs,
[SPEAKER_00]: constricting urinary bladder.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, our sympathetic
nervous system, this pathway, is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can increase the heart rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can kind of inhibit activity of
digestive organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're noticing that stimuli
activity of digestive, here we're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: having an inhibition effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither of these can be controlled by
conscious thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, your pupils constricting or
dilating don't have direct control over
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compulsive elements that act in opposition
to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the key point here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a way to constrict the pupils of
your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a way to dilate the pupils of your
eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to increase your production of
saliva.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a way to inhibit that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these kind of play off one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sympathetic pathway typically
dominates in a time of stress and it
[SPEAKER_00]: controls the fight or flight reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also increase blood pressure,
heart rate, and breathing as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now comparing our autonomic and our
somatic efferent pathways, we kind of see
[SPEAKER_00]: them evident here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of these are kind of operating
along the same lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're essentially the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's different is what branches that
they're involved in, what exact
[SPEAKER_00]: connections that they make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, our autonomic efferent
pathway here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this connection between the neuron
to the ganglion, which then forms a second
[SPEAKER_00]: projection from the ganglion to the target
effector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially here, there's an
intermediate that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this kind of connection,
an intermediate, before we're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: getting to the target effector.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, smooth muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example here, our somatic
reflexes, for instance, involve a direct
[SPEAKER_00]: connection from the spinal cord to skill
to muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is allowing this direct
connection here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's our synapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no intermediate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be, example here,
the target effector is a smooth muscle
[SPEAKER_00]: having this intermediate ganglion neuron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have this direct connection
between our spinal cord and our skill to
[SPEAKER_00]: muscle, which would be under voluntary
control.
So here's our synapse.
