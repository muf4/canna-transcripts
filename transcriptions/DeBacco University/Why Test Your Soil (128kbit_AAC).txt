[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of states the obvious
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why test your soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear a lot of people doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's advised by a lot of agriculturists
and consultants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why should I test my soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something just to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be simply you just don't know
about the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a new site.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a new field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be new soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be something you're looking at
testing or screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may help you develop a baseline to
work from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just kind of looking at a field,
looking at an area that everything may
[SPEAKER_00]: look the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a lot of underlying question
marks here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just what is the pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the nutrient levels?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one reason why you would test
your soil just to learn about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go beyond just visual.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have a problem area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're attempting to use this as a
diagnostic tool, you could use sample the
[SPEAKER_00]: normal area separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can act as an area of comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have the picture here of the little
barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I notice here it's nice,
consistent green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm noticing in this area much lighter
coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It continues into a couple of pockets
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I may want to go through and sample
this area differently than this area to
[SPEAKER_00]: see if this is a real problem area related
to soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it could be drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that could be another reason why
you're looking at soil testing is
[SPEAKER_00]: investigating a problem area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also recheck an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you had an area that was kind of
bad, was a problem area, keep the original
[SPEAKER_00]: test with your records and the additions
that you added.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then retest is a great way to
determine the trend of your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you getting to that fair, hopefully
that better or improve those good
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the timing of your recheck is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to allow time for adjustments to
have time to be incorporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if you notice your pH is
low and you add lime, don't go out the
[SPEAKER_00]: next day and test your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a while for that lime to kind of
activate and adjust that pH range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do retest it the day after,
a week after, that might give you a false
[SPEAKER_00]: reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some nutrients, especially in for pH
changes, if using lime, you want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: careful and allow time for that to
sufficiently break down, retest,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you get a more accurate
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, you could test your soil because
someone told you to.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means clearly you have good friends,
but hopefully your reasons fit one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: previously mentioned categories to allow
you to have that information and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: that self-looking at your soil as a way to
improve your overall crop health.
