[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here we're going to look at grow
nutrient formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, you'll see companies market the
word grow on their fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_00]: as these four have, and what that kind of
equates to is a larger amount or
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of nitrogen that they contain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, it's nitrogen fosters
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 1266, this is a 633,
a 795, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no set fertilizer ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, grow nutrients will simply just
have more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is containing more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to produce a greater plant
growth, more leaf growth, more top growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, though, if you are planning
on cloning the plant, you may want to
[SPEAKER_00]: watch how much nitrogen you feed your
plants, because that can potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: negatively impact your ability to clone
that mother plant going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that nitrogen I mentioned,
this nutrient is very quick-acting,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's better to focus on feeding just
enough, because it's easy to overfeed with
[SPEAKER_00]: this nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are suspecting a nitrogen
deficiency, add some nitrogen-based
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer, water it in so it gets to the
root zone, and wait about three to four
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see a change in the plant response,
then it was nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't, then move on to something
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't keep adding nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also comes in different forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have urea here, calcium nitrate,
and blood neo.
[SPEAKER_00]: All kind of ways of delivering nitrogen,
very different amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 13%, and this one is 46% nitrogen,
so that will adjust the amounts that you
[SPEAKER_00]: do add.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that growth formulations may have
higher nitrogen number, but there's other
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients to consider, phosphorus and
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not simply apply for the nitrogen and
ignore the other nutrients that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This must be taken into consideration as
you plan your long-term growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, this nutrient here says grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would think it's high nitrogen,
and it contains 7%, but 4% phosphorus and
[SPEAKER_00]: 10% potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were just focusing on the nitrogen
here, you could be over-adding on the
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium end of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why you got to look at the entire
nutrient blend and applying it as part of
[SPEAKER_00]: an entire program for the growth cycle,
and not just focusing on one particular
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, there's something called flushing
the media, where plants may involve adding
[SPEAKER_00]: water, just like the toilet bowl here,
where you're flushing with about three
[SPEAKER_00]: times the volume of the media to help
remove excessive salts and nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: buildup that may have occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is in part where careful
additions are important because you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to selectively add your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help reduce the chance of
building up excessive salts, which can
[SPEAKER_00]: damage the root system and reduce your
need to flush the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're flushing the plants here,
you're potentially wasting out some
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, so if you want to be very
careful on your feeding program throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire growth cycle, so you're as
efficient as possible in minimizing waste.
Thank you.
Thank you.
