[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
we're going to go over the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: cariophylline in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the terpene
guide to cariophylline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see in the image here is some
black pepper because that's kind of what
[SPEAKER_00]: represents this particular terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at the scent
location and general properties of this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular terpene, it has a spicy peppery
woody kind of scent to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we had the black pepper image
at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Foods that it contains, obviously black
pepper, rosemary, oregano, cloves,
[SPEAKER_00]: and other dark leafy green herbal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find cariophylline in lavender,
black pepper, and cinnamon leaves as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cariophylline will selectively bind to CB2
receptors, which are actually found
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the brain and other parts of
the body, resulting in possible
[SPEAKER_00]: classification as a cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of an interesting tidbit there as
far as how this might be classified in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But currently it is classified as a
terpene simply because it's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive component of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably what's causing it to
fall into the terpene category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the medical benefits of this
particular terpene is that it does bind to
[SPEAKER_00]: also CB3 receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be highly useful for inflammatory
disorders such as arthritis, multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: sclerosis, and chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cariophylline can also be beneficial for
treating anxiety and depression without
[SPEAKER_00]: the overwhelming mental effects found from
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're looking for what strains
that might have a little bit higher of
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular terpene, here is some
general information provided, along with
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the structure and some other
general information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, these are just some to
initially start looking at as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: strains go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's many others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also kind of a little summary slide here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you liked this video, we have other
ones on various other terpenes here on
[SPEAKER_00]: DeBacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
