[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over a basic
sleep overview that hopefully you'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: to experience after this video and not
during the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, there's different types of
sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two major types.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's what we call non-rapid eye
movement, which is NREM, and rapid eye
[SPEAKER_00]: movement, which is abbreviated REM.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll pass through four stages of NREM
during the first 30 to 45 minutes of
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep, and REM sleep occurs after the
fourth NREM stage has been achieved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these different stages, I'll go over
them in detail in a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's important to see, if you look at
this graph, that we don't just go to one
[SPEAKER_00]: stage and stay there the entire night.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually cycling through different
stages multiple times, potentially through
[SPEAKER_00]: even just one night's rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the importance of sleep, it's
important that we get enough sleep,
[SPEAKER_00]: which does change based on our age,
and I won't tell you what time I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: recording this video, but slow wave sleep
is vital for restoring the body's hormones
[SPEAKER_00]: and maintaining your overall health.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why even if you eat three meals a
day, you still can become tired,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though you're consuming energy,
because your body's hormones are not in
[SPEAKER_00]: the proper balance to maintain your
overall health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those deprived of REM sleep become woody
and depressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: REM sleep may actually be a reverse
learning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, information that you may have
acquired throughout the day is purged from
[SPEAKER_00]: the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're basically not putting that into
long-term memory storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daily sleep requirements do decline with
age, with newborns being zero to three
[SPEAKER_00]: months, requiring the most amount of
sleep, 14 to 17 hours, and older adults,
[SPEAKER_00]: those classified as six to five years and
older, requiring the least amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep, suggested between seven to eight
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's different stages of sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, we're looking at an EEG,
which is kind of a brainwave map.
[SPEAKER_00]: The different stages in the activity of
the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stage one is introduction to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where your eyes fight to stay
open, which you may be experiencing just
[SPEAKER_00]: watching this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your muscles begin to relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: The physical world starts disappearing
around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is stage one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we progress to stage two,
which is the beginning of sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light dreamless sleep, our relaxation
takes over the body as it prepares for
[SPEAKER_00]: dreams that are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: From stage two, we progress to stage three
and four, are considered slow-wave sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is considered the deep sleep,
building up a physical and mental energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is where the body gets its rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here, the brainwave activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, that REM, or that rapid eye
movement, is the dreaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: This improves brain function and creates
long-term memories, as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the brainwaves, again,
compared to that awake state.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here, that awake state jumping around,
very intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here, even though there may be higher
peaks and valleys, it's stretched out over
[SPEAKER_00]: a greater time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's REM sleep here, creating the least
amount of brainwave activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you might be wondering, how do whales
and dolphins sleep when they're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: swimming in the ocean here?
[SPEAKER_00]: They still need to breathe, they are
mammals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, both whales and dolphins,
only one brain hemisphere falls asleep at
[SPEAKER_00]: a time, allowing them still to surface
from the water so that they can breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the left hemisphere for a while,
and then transfer over and then rest the
[SPEAKER_00]: right hemisphere while the left hemisphere
becomes awake.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so they can also maintain that
proper hormone balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, here are some sleep disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Narcolepsy is the lapsing abruptly into
sleep from an awake state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insomnia is chronic inability to obtain
the amount or quality of sleep needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be because of things that we're
doing, keeping us up at night,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of spilling over, closer to the
morning that we may like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Narcolepsy here, where we're maybe
studying and then all of a sudden just
[SPEAKER_00]: fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe on a microscope, for example,
for those taking biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also something you may have
heard of called sleep apnea.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a temporary stopping of breathing
during sleep, and this could occur because
[SPEAKER_00]: of a closure in breathing passageways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are three common types of sleep
disorders that you may have heard about or
[SPEAKER_00]: may have even experienced a little bit of
yourself.
Thank you.
