[SPEAKER_00]: You ever wondered what the best conditions
are to store your cannabis seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here at Tobacco University,
we're going to answer that question,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at some scientific literature,
looking at cannabis seeds in particular,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how best to store them for the
greatest longevity.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the video on how
to store your cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, here is the reference
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of can give you that more
detailed information if you want to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the actual article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to provide you with a brief
overview of this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, how does storage temperature
impact seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this study was performed on cannabis
seeds, so great for no need to make any
[SPEAKER_00]: analogs or any comparisons was actually
done on cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seedling lengths measured in centimeters
were compared across the following number
[SPEAKER_00]: of storage months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was basically zero storage
months, three, six, nine, 12, 18,
[SPEAKER_00]: 24, and up to 36 months in this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, each storage month,
the moisture content of the seeds was also
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluated, and moisture content of the
seeds was five, seven, eight, 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 12%.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is performed across three different
storage temperatures, ambient,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it started off at 10 degrees Celsius
or 50 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter
[SPEAKER_00]: months, and then went up to 40 degrees
Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit in the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer, and then fluctuated between those
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others were stored at a consistent 15
degrees Celsius or 59 degrees Fahrenheit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and another set was stored consistently at
negative 20 degrees Celsius or negative
[SPEAKER_00]: four degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this ambient storage conditions where
there was those difference between the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter and the summer months.
[SPEAKER_00]: This continual temperature fluctuation did
reduce the storage time across all seed
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture contents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 5% moisture content seeds were able
to have germination past nine months of
[SPEAKER_00]: storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see the seedling length in
centimeters measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see only that 5% had any sort of
basic germination beyond nine months.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the other seven, eight, 10,
and 12% moisture, basically they all
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially perished or became non-viable
after that six month time frame there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those stored at a consistent 15
degrees Celsius or negative 20 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under these temperatures, if the moisture
content of the seeds was under 10%,
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling growth could still occur for up
to 36 months of storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if the moisture content is 7% or
less, then seeds have similar seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: lengths there, which is important to note.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking that kind of drier the seed,
the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're noticing that those higher moisture
content above that 7%, we're seeing a
[SPEAKER_00]: noticeable drop off in the seedling
lengths in centimeters as those storage
[SPEAKER_00]: months progress at both the 15 degrees
Celsius and also the minus 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, to less extent the minus 20
compared to the 15 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about this seed
moisture, you might be wondering,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, what seed percent moisture are my
seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're purchasing seeds,
you should be getting some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: information with the seeds that you're
purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, you typically can find the
moisture content.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just two random examples I
pulled off the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see here though, this one has a
moisture content of 3.68% and this one
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.31%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go back to the data, we were just
looking at, those numbers are well below
[SPEAKER_00]: the 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good sign that those are
quality seeds that have the potential to
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate to 36 months and beyond assuming
proper storage of their environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions that you keep them under.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the great scheme of things,
the kind of summary here, how should you
[SPEAKER_00]: be storing your cannabis seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the best conditions to go through
and store?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, low moisture content seeds under 10%
with 5% being suggested is advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool conditions, which would be under 15
degrees Celsius or 59 degrees Fahrenheit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also dark conditions would be advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking though to keep your
seeds for the long term, then taking the
[SPEAKER_00]: extra step to store seeds in an
environment that is minus 20 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius or minus four degrees Fahrenheit
is justified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get that increased odds of
germination and producing a seedling as
[SPEAKER_00]: far out as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very important if you're looking at
storing those seeds for a long duration of
[SPEAKER_00]: time there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this again shows some
comparisons here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Effect of the moisture content and storage
period percent germination at ambient
[SPEAKER_00]: storage A, which is where it was
fluctuating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it drops pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 degrees Celsius and then minus 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that being the most consistent
in both conditions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the effect of seed moisture
content and storage period on seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, A representing those ambient
conditions was fluctuating summer and
[SPEAKER_00]: winter times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the 15 degrees and then the minus
20 degrees Celsius there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, hopefully this helps provide
some scientific literature and research
[SPEAKER_00]: background to what temperature and
moisture content should be looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: your seeds for the greatest germination
and over the longest period of time.
