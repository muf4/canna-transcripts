[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Tobacco University's video
presentation of Pollen's role in forensic
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we may not consider Pollen to be
a vital role in forensic science,
[SPEAKER_00]: those that are very detail oriented and
can discover this, it may play a very
[SPEAKER_00]: important aspect of the evidence
collection for pinpointing a crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Pollen's main role, and Pollen is
simply that small little tiny almost
[SPEAKER_00]: dust-like appearance that flowers will
produce for the goal of pollination to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Pollen's used to help provide those
links.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can take on different forms,
but the goal is to aid in allowing to
[SPEAKER_00]: strengthen a case with increased evidence
linking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it may not be the only thing
used, it can help strengthen a case and
[SPEAKER_00]: really provide an investigator some solid
evidence and information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make note that the same
concepts can be also applied to spores
[SPEAKER_00]: that are applied here as shown for Pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what is Pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Pollen is simply the male
reproductive cell of flowering plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: those angiosperms, and cone-bearing
plants, those gymnosperms, found nearly
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere, which makes it great to
consider for crime scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pollen has many unique shapes and
sizes when viewed with the aid of a
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may see it here as this all this kind
of little tiny yellow particulate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under a microscope, it can look vastly
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the same genus, there are often
similarities, but between different plant
[SPEAKER_00]: species, there's definitely some
noticeable differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: As this Pollen can be kind of like
nature's snapshot, which what does that
[SPEAKER_00]: mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Pollen can help identify the area or
the region that a particular crime may
[SPEAKER_00]: have occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can produce a Pollen fingerprint,
meaning what plants exist in what area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we find that Pollen, we know that on
that individual, that garment or that
[SPEAKER_00]: clothing will have to be present in a
certain region.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also help us pinpoint potentially
the time of year, meaning what Pollen is
[SPEAKER_00]: found, what flowers bloom during certain
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there might be a limited window for
certain plants, and that might really help
[SPEAKER_00]: determine the time of year that that
garment was found or that clothing was
[SPEAKER_00]: present at that crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Pollen can be used to determine if
the body was in a particular place at a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific time frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also identify the season the crime
was committed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if a body is discovered and contains
non-native Pollen, it was likely moved
[SPEAKER_00]: prior to its present location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these can be vital information
that can be gathered to, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: help strengthen a case when we're looking
at developing what may have occurred at a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I mentioned, Pollen can have very
different looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what do you look for?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to visually inspect with a
microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to look at the Pollen shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to look at the size, the surface
texture, and not knowing anything about
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the images located down
over here, we can definitely see there are
[SPEAKER_00]: some distinctive visual differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good investigator would compare
specimens from the crime scene with that
[SPEAKER_00]: on the suspect and or victim to determine
if there's a similar Pollen signature or
[SPEAKER_00]: the likelihood of there being a match
between those two.
