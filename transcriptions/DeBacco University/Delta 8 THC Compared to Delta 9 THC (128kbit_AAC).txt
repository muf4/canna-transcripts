[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you may have heard of Delta-8 THC
and Delta-9 THC and wondered what the
[SPEAKER_00]: differences were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here on this tobacco university
video, we're going to go over and compare
[SPEAKER_00]: just what Delta-8 THC is compared to what
Delta-9 THC is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you find this information
useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into Delta-8 THC
compared to Delta-9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, Delta-8 THC can be
classified currently as hemp, where
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta-9 THC is what can classify a
cannabis plant as marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, let's explain the Delta-9
THC, something you might have heard a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more, might be more familiar
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an activator of the CB1 receptor,
the Delta-9.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's commonly known as THC and is the main
intoxicating component to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC intoxication has been shown to
increase blood flow in the peripheral
[SPEAKER_00]: frontal cortex region of the brain,
which is responsible for decision-making,
[SPEAKER_00]: attention, motor skills, and other
executive functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: When THC binds to a CB1 receptors in the
brain's reward system, it can trigger the
[SPEAKER_00]: feelings of euphoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much of THC's ability to relieve pain is
due to its interaction with the CB1
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors in the midbrain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to talk about Delta-8 THC,
but here's just a little comparison of the
[SPEAKER_00]: structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see at first glance, pretty
similar, look almost identical,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the key part here is the double bond
here, the double bond here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the difference between your Delta-9
and your Delta-8 has to do where that
[SPEAKER_00]: double bond is located.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's also great benefits and
that's a switch of a double bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also some differences in how these
molecules interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at the Delta-8 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta-8 is an isomer of Delta-9.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned here, it's a changing of
where that double bond is located.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only differs from the placement of that
atomic double bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only a structural difference,
at least on a molecule basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, this chemical is produced in a
lab and not extracted directly from the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is actually synthesized from a CBD
isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This creates a legal loophole though,
because the product is being sold as hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: derived, even though it's actually
chemically produced THC isomer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important kind of distinction
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why there's some of the
confusion and why there's some companies
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising a lot of Delta-8 THC compared
to Delta-9.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at the kind of extraction
difference here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Delta-8 THC is a major cannabinoid that
can be found in abundance and is easily
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In comparison, when we look at extracting
Delta-8 THC, it is more challenging simply
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a minor cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at the challenge
parts of Delta-8, it's simply less
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore it's a minor cannabinoid,
it's a little bit harder to extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting article published,
and what is the difference between Delta-8
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and Delta-9 THC here, that we'll be
going through some of that information as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as what you've heard already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're synthesizing Delta-8 from
CBD, Delta-8 can be synthesized entirely
[SPEAKER_00]: from CBD with the use of solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deriving Delta-8 from hemp ensures that
the final product is under the 0.3% THC
[SPEAKER_00]: level to be federally legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a key point there is that
you're staying under the federally
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated 0.3% THC levels, because that's
referring to Delta-9.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's classifying it as hemp,
because marijuana would be anything really
[SPEAKER_00]: above 0.3% THC from a federal standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you see these large signs,
Delta-8 THC, because a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with the letters THC,
but this Delta-8 is classifying it
[SPEAKER_00]: currently to be hemp, which has much more
legal options to be sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you want to know the steps to
synthesize Delta-8 THC from a CBD isolate,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are basically listed right here from
a patent from the website link here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it kind of goes through a little bit
of the process, and this is not a
[SPEAKER_00]: completely easy process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to dissolve the non-polar solvent
choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common solvents include a heptane,
add a Lewis acid, and add a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to maintain certain temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to stir for a long period of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the chemical reaction is complete,
under phase separation, you want to watch
[SPEAKER_00]: and neutralize a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to test for purity and
contaminants using high pressure liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatography, and then the conversion
still, despite all these very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific steps, is still never quite
100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not something necessarily easy to
derive.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, there are different effects
from Delta-8 THC versus Delta-9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta-9 is considerably more potent
effects than Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paranoia, delusions, mental fog,
impaired motor skills, and increased
[SPEAKER_00]: feelings of anxiety typically associated
with Delta-9.
[SPEAKER_00]: In comparison, Delta-8 is reported to
provide a more muted experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: with most users feeling a great sense of
common clarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, many have reported a definite
high to the experience, but not enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: impair the ability to form coherent
thoughts or focus on activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also provides a little comparison
there of Delta-9 versus Delta-8 listed
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, again, a little bit more from
anecdotal information, but it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: gives you that little bit of a quick
comparison between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also some similarities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the onset time is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Delta-9 has an onset that's more rapid
and instantaneous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta-8 works slowly and gradually as it
eases users to a more mellow state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep that in mind that Delta-8
can have a little bit more of that delayed
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of effect there, hopefully not for
your airline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar end products are being produced
from both, because both can be smoked as a
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, inhaled through vaping,
consumed as an edible form, also a wide
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of topicals, capsules,
tinctures, edibles, and other products as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, which you'll see the Delta-8 usually
predominantly listed on the label or
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we get into legality of things,
and it's always subject to change,
[SPEAKER_00]: but currently Delta-8 THC in any amount
over 0.3% is not legal at the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: State level depends entirely on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta-8 is still technically legal at the
federal level, simply because the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: way that the 2018 farm bill is written,
which legalizes hemp production,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there is nothing within the bill that
prevents deriving Delta-8 from hemp and
[SPEAKER_00]: creating products with that particular
compound, at least as it's stated and
[SPEAKER_00]: currently in the books right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this creates that hazy area,
as I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: The psychoactive nature of Delta-8 has
prompted a fair number of bans at the
[SPEAKER_00]: state level though, so keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're currently, as this particular
video and in the article cited,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are 15 states that restrict the sale
and use of Delta-8 products, with another
[SPEAKER_00]: six states where legal action is currently
pending.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while Delta-8 is more widespread at the
moment than Delta-9, how long will it last
[SPEAKER_00]: is yet to be determined, simply because
it's caught in that loophole of the
[SPEAKER_00]: current 2018 farm bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the availability of this, so when we
look at the availability, Delta-8,
[SPEAKER_00]: since it's federally legal, can be shipped
across state lines, unlike Delta-9.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more online retailers for
Delta-8 products as a result, because they
[SPEAKER_00]: can ship it and move it across state lines
without a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, just remember that Delta-8
products are not regulated by the FDA,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's up to you to seek out lab results
tested from a third party to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're consuming and purchasing is
actually what you think you're purchasing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and is also safe to be using and
consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last little comparison, kind of that
Delta-9 versus Delta-8, Delta-9 might be
[SPEAKER_00]: considered the classic choice by some
within the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, Delta-8 is quickly gaining
popularity due to its milder effects and
[SPEAKER_00]: legal availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, since it's an isomer of Delta-9,
it's also likely to come under some form
[SPEAKER_00]: of regulation in the future, even though
that may not currently be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that simple flip of that double
bond there doesn't look like it changes
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here with the changing of
effects, but really how the current laws
[SPEAKER_00]: are written, kind of in that hazy loophole
area, but hopefully this provides you a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more of an educational
background so you can understand better
[SPEAKER_00]: the difference between Delta-9 THC and
Delta-8 THC levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
Thank you.
