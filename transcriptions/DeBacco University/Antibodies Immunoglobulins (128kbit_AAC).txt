[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to look at antibodies
or immunoglobulins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both are interchangeable terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the image here on the title slide
with a constant region and a variable
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: The variable region here is referring to
the ends here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice these little cutaways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shape is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: These proteins need to bind to antigens,
and this is why there's a variable region
[SPEAKER_00]: up here is because of different shapes
these can take on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking specifically at the definition
of an immunoglobulin, these are a class of
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins of the immune system that are
also known as antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, they're kind of
interchangeable terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is an antibody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, antibodies are attached to foreign
substances to allow the immune system to
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to make note here that the
antibodies are not the ones doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: destruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're merely attaching to the surfaces
to kind of signal the immune system to
[SPEAKER_00]: come destroy this foreign substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're specific to each type of foreign
substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this variable region, these specific
shapes, match a very specific foreign
[SPEAKER_00]: substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, we have many different
types of antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can classify them into these five
main groups, IgA, IgG, IgM, IgE,
[SPEAKER_00]: and IgD, and the IgC for abbreviation for
the immunoglobulin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each or levels of each type of these
antibodies can give your doctor an
[SPEAKER_00]: indication about the cause of a medical
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we'll see in some, there's certain
tests we'll do for certain antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: To determine if your body's been exposed
to certain antigens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now within our classifications,
we have monomers, dimers, referring to
[SPEAKER_00]: two, and pentamers here, referring to five
different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only IgM's are pentamers.
[SPEAKER_00]: IgAs are dimers, and IgD, IgE,
and IgG are both monomer antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with IgA here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're found in areas of the body such as
the nose, breathing passages, and
[SPEAKER_00]: digestive tract.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important that these antibodies are
located in these regions because they
[SPEAKER_00]: protect body surfaces that are exposed to
the outside foreign substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is their specialty.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 10 to 15% of the antibodies present
in the body are IgAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a small number of people actually do
not produce IgA antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a rarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you need them to live?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but by having them, you're able to
better protect your surfaces that are in
[SPEAKER_00]: direct exposure to the outside
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have IgGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, the first G I should say
is lowercase, and the second G is
[SPEAKER_00]: uppercase.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're found in all body fluids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a monomer, and they're the most
common antibody found in the body,
[SPEAKER_00]: about 75% to 80%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important for fighting bacteria and
viral infections, and the only type of
[SPEAKER_00]: antibody that can cross the placenta in
pregnant women.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps protect her baby or fetus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also utilized here as we see this
Zika virus antibody test, IgG and IgM
[SPEAKER_00]: antibody test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're looking for someone that may
be exposed to the Zika virus, might be
[SPEAKER_00]: carrying it some way, we can test for the
antibodies to see if they're present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why the antibody test,
you see here and here, an IgG and IgM
[SPEAKER_00]: indication, referring to the antibodies
classification that this test is
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating if it's indicated its presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: IgM are found in the blood and lymph
fluid, are the first type of antibody made
[SPEAKER_00]: in response to an infection, and they
cause other immune system cells to destroy
[SPEAKER_00]: foreign substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: IgM antibodies are about 5% of all the
antibodies in the body, and they're the
[SPEAKER_00]: only ones that fall into the pentamer
class.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see our antibody level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have initial dose of antigen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see IgM, primary response increases
above IgG, and then goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our second dose of antigen, the IgM does
come back, but our IgG can see very
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So IgM are the first type of antibody made
in response to an infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The initial or primary response.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are made during the secondary dose of
the antigen, but you could see that in
[SPEAKER_00]: relation to IgG, their secondary immune
response is minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: IgE, if you suffer from allergies,
this is one that you can blame here,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're found in the lungs, skin,
and mucous membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cause it by to react against foreign
substances such as pollen, fungal spores,
[SPEAKER_00]: and animal dander.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're involved in allergic reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The levels of IgE are often high in people
with allergies and there's certain limits
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as what would be considered a low
level, moderate, high, and very high
[SPEAKER_00]: levels here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can classify them as such.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are more sensitive to certain
pollens or allergens, you can probably
[SPEAKER_00]: blame IgE for your reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: IgD is an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are antibodies found in small
amounts in the tissues that line the belly
[SPEAKER_00]: and chest.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, exactly how they work is actually
not 100% clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We acknowledge their presence,
they do have some very basic idea of their
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding, but exactly how they work
specifically is actually not clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as it goes to show, scientists are
continuing to do research on things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we may know exist, but we need to
understand better how they perform and
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: A way to remind device to kind of remember
these, it's called Gamed, so you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: forget any, G-A-M-E-D, and this is
referring to the different antibodies
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also a great summary slide to kind
of give you that review of what IgG does,
[SPEAKER_00]: IgM, IgD, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the five immunoglobin classes
here, we see the names, we see the
[SPEAKER_00]: properties, and associate with the
structure here on the right-hand side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just another way to help you review and
help you understand the difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: the different types of immunoglobin
present in your body.
Thank you.
