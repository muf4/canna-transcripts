[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we'll look at some probiotic
additions commonly added to soil or to
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to help protect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycorrhizae, azespirillum, root shield,
and actinivate are some common ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see this evident in like yogurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here soygurt, where we see the use
of probiotics to show that there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial microbes in this particular
product that has live cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, probiotics are beneficial
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding microbes are life to your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some companies sell blends so growers can
get a wide mix of microbes with one
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other companies favor monospecies by
trying to match a species with a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you have to look at some of the
labels and some of what they include.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at mycorrhizae, for example,
this helps increase root to soil surface
[SPEAKER_00]: area interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works best when plants are grown in
stressful conditions and there's two
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's endomycorrhizal fungi,
which grows within the roots and can form
[SPEAKER_00]: similar symbiotic relationships with about
85% of terrestrial plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: For cannabis, this is kind of what you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want an endomycorrhizal fungi species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ectomycorrhizal fungi live on the outside
of root cells and they mainly form
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships with conifers and other
hardwoods there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that cannabis is an annual,
so you want to be focusing here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: endomycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also your tomatoes, your squash,
pepper plants can also associate with
[SPEAKER_00]: endomycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a symbiotic relationship that works
because the fungi provides increased soil
[SPEAKER_00]: contact with the roots to benefit the host
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of this interrelationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fungus here is providing this
increased web, increased interaction with
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: As in return, the fungi is able to get
sugars from the plant, which is made in
[SPEAKER_00]: the upper leaf structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is kind of that symbiotic
relationship between these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungus provides increased surface area,
plant provides sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Azospirillium papillaceae is a
nitrogen-mixing bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often used in the early stages of
plant development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that this is a warm
weather-derived species, so applying it in
[SPEAKER_00]: cold soils will have little benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: With bacteria, they can go through this
very quick exponential phase as
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure they provide with
enough food and resources, otherwise
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll go through a very quick death
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick to rise, quick to fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, in soil environments,
this is typically associated with root
[SPEAKER_00]: structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it will increase with heat and
heat of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be mindful of that, that applying it to
cold soils will do a little good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a product called Root Shield,
Root Shield Plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made by BioWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains two active ingredients,
two different strains of trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It colonizes plant roots to help reduce
the chance of infection by a pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a granular and a wettable powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: The granular is preferred due to the
longer shelf life and ease of application.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like very, very fine sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wettable powder cannot be run through
drip irrigation systems and has a shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while they both have the same active
ingredient, same end result, the granular
[SPEAKER_00]: can be preferred simply because of its
longer shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be easily mixed into growing media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we have Actinovate made by
Valiant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains streptomyces, a particular
microbe in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have some supporting scientific
documentation, supporting the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: suppress disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be run through drip irrigation
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of an advantageous of this
particular fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these can be very expensive,
so you have to be mindful where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just want to give you some ideas of
some very common probiotics that should be
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially considered if you're having a
problem and you want to approach it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: biological way.
