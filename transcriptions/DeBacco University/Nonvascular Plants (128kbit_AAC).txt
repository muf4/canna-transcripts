[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, we're going to be
investigating nonvascular plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put in parenthesis here is bryophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a classification of plants that we
might commonly refer to as mosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more scientifically called
bryophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're considered very early or primitive
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about why that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start with, the reason why we say
they're primitive is they're not too far
[SPEAKER_00]: away from green algae in our cladogram
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are considered to be the first
successful land plants that have no
[SPEAKER_00]: vascular system.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, the maximum size of the plant
is greatly limited because all materials
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be transported by diffusion and
osmosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even under ideal growing conditions,
you'll see mosses are very short.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get very tall because they
don't have this vascular system and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything has to go through the process
of diffusion and osmosis, and this limits
[SPEAKER_00]: their overall height that they can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, diffusion is a net movement
of molecules from an area of high
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration to an area of low
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here with the food dye in the bottle,
it's diffusing throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we came back a couple days later,
this would all hopefully be a consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: blue color when everything diffused
through the water, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you another example of that,
here's high concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it going to low concentration over
time to the point that the molecules on
[SPEAKER_00]: the top and bottom side will equal one
another, and this is the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: diffusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Osmosis is a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Osmosis is the process by which molecules
of the solvent tend to pass through a
[SPEAKER_00]: semipermeable membrane from a less
concentrated solution into a more
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated one, resulting in equal
concentrations on both sides of the
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our solvent molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our solvent molecules can't pass through
this semipermeable membrane, but the water
[SPEAKER_00]: can, and that will result in a change in
the water height here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water molecules travel through this
membrane trying to even out on both sides,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to make even concentrations on both
sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Osmosis, as we saw in red blood cells,
we could see them causing the shrivel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isotonic is when equal water's moving in
and out, and hypotonic is when more
[SPEAKER_00]: water's coming in and going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In red blood cells, they could lyse or
break apart, and in hypertonic,
[SPEAKER_00]: think of it like making a pickle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get that kind of shriveled look to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see now we're talking about plants,
kind of the translation of that hypertonic
[SPEAKER_00]: situation called plasmolysis in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isotonic is called flaccid, and hypotonic
is detergid.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of water here, a lot of
water pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be important to hold plants
upright.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about nondesquial plants or
bryophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually some other
classifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liverworts, hornworts, and mosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what a liverwort, hornwort,
and moss looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chose mosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably most familiar with that,
but all of these, pretty much lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: vascular system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mosses has a very simple conducting
tissue, soft strands, but for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: part, these are all considered
nonvascular.
[SPEAKER_00]: The life cycle of a moss, not to get into
too much detail, the key part is because
[SPEAKER_00]: they are so low growing, and again,
transporting all their nutrients through
[SPEAKER_00]: diffusion and osmosis, they need water
transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a moss dries out, they are unable to
reproduce, need that sperm being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: swim to the egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we typically see them in
shaded, regions or areas that tend to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of moisture in that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilization process is the same,
sperm meeting egg, producing an embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sporophytes developed, we see a female
gametophyte, a male gametophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: These need to have a union between the
two, need to merge with one another with
[SPEAKER_00]: water present, and that will then form the
fertilization process that forms the
[SPEAKER_00]: embryo that goes around.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also involved a little bit of
alternation of generations that can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is in another video there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part with mosses being so low and
nonvascular, they typically are found in
[SPEAKER_00]: areas with high water content.
Thanks for watching.
