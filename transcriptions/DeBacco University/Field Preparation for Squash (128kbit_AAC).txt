[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to cover the basics
for field preparation for squash planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you could do the traditional disking
method here and tilling of the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: field, or some people are going to what's
called a no-till operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're spraying an herbicide down the
center path here where they'll be planting
[SPEAKER_00]: the individual squash seeds and allowing a
green kind of cover crop to exist in
[SPEAKER_00]: between the rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two different ways to approach
preparation for field for squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in general squash are native to the
Americas, considered the New World,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's part-wide perform well in the New
England climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tend to perform them quite well and
get good harvest with not necessarily a
[SPEAKER_00]: ton of special inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking for a growth site to
evaluate, we want a good field conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We define as those that have full sun,
well drained, and a near neutral pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now because they tend to do well in this
area and they tend not to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest return on investment,
in comparison say like a tomato,
[SPEAKER_00]: these crops are commonly planted in what's
called the next best plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been at the best, most ideal field,
but the next best field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we're preparing our fields for
squash, they don't have to be first on the
[SPEAKER_00]: list.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be later on the list because
squash perform warm field soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preparations are commonly done later on
the list or later in the season in
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison to other fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't stay as memorial day,
sometimes even slightly later,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into June, at least early June,
because they like that warm soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when planted, they kind of jump up and
get going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they may not be the first prepared,
but they should be in your rotation and
[SPEAKER_00]: wait until that soil gets warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plant them too early, they will not
perform well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're going to do.
So that's what we're going to do.
So that's what we're going to do.
