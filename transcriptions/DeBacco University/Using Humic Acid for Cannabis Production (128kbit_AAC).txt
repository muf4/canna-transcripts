[SPEAKER_00]: Interested in learning more about adding
humic acid to your cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've come to the right place here at
Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here, we're going to discuss this
very topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into using humic acid
for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what is humic acid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably should in general just define
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humic and folic acids are the final
breakdown components of decaying plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and animals found in prehistoric deposits.
[SPEAKER_00]: One source of humic acids is the
sedimentation of layers found in
[SPEAKER_00]: Li-Ardenite, and it's kind of this kind of
fine powdered black granulated form.
[SPEAKER_00]: This organic matter has not reached the
state of coal, but it kind of has some
[SPEAKER_00]: properties, or at least feels similar to
coal, and it differs from soft brown coal
[SPEAKER_00]: by its high oxidation degree, as in as a
result, the process of coal formation has
[SPEAKER_00]: no value as fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not going to like burn like coal,
but if you look at it and didn't quite
[SPEAKER_00]: know what it was, it has some similarities
to like a very finely granulated coal
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at the research article
here where they looked at the impact of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen phosphatassim and humic acid
supplementation, looking at the chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: profile of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm just going to provide a
brief overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the link.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can learn more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So humic acid and THC levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for example, the following humic
acid applications, THC levels at the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant was reduced from 11.8 to
7.4%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And consequently, concentrations
throughout the plant height did not differ
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're looking just again at the THC,
the top, center, and bottom portions of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant definitely seemed like there was
a reduction, which kind of seems a little
[SPEAKER_00]: odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our commercial, phosphatassim is
our humic acids, that there's an overall,
[SPEAKER_00]: this reduction from 11.8 to 7.8% THC
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit concerning here if we're
looking at trying to maximize some
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also see here with CBD and CBG,
some of the differences that occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a clear indication of what
occurred with just THC levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, more data here if you want to
investigate or pause the video right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going on to the impact of humic acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the nutrition treatments were
supplemented with humic acid, enhanced
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus fertilization, or enhanced
nitrogen phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humic acid was found to reduce the natural
variability of all of the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just kind of concerning there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The results demonstrate sensitivity of
cannabinoid metabolism to mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be mindful that adding more
inputs to your plants may not get you
[SPEAKER_00]: always more return.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's nutrients impact on the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phosphorus enhanced treatment did not
affect THC, CBD, CBN, or CBG
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations in the flowers from the top
of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 16% reduction of THC concentration was
observed in inflorescent leaves though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an important note.
[SPEAKER_00]: The complete NPK supplementation increased
CBG levels in the flowers by 71% and
[SPEAKER_00]: lowered CBN levels in both flowers and
inflorescent leaves by 38 and 36%
[SPEAKER_00]: respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is also where it comes important
as growers to understand what cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically you're looking to produce or
maximize because that can impact what
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers or what treatments you might
give to your plants rather than just
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to try something and hope for
better results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at targeting specific compounds
and how they are influenced by the inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: that the grower utilizes you can see here
has a great impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to do anything that's an
increased cost and time and labor that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to cause a reduction in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be an informed grower, do your
research, and make educated decisions on
[SPEAKER_00]: anything you choose to add.
