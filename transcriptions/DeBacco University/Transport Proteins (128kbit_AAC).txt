[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the topic of this video is transport
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking here at our phospholipid bilayer,
we see several proteins embedded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's remember, looking back,
diffusion can occur without any proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, here we're looking at transport
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these examples, we're looking at
substances that may need a protein to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to move them across the phospholipid
bilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this can be because of their size,
because of their charge, for many
[SPEAKER_00]: different reasons, but simply they need a
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, needing a protein does not
automatically mean it needs energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Passive transport can occur with channel
proteins and carrier-mediated proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, not all carrier proteins are part
of the passive transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some do require energy, and we call those
active transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at some of those in more
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting first with active transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: This requires energy from ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, adenosine triphosphate to move
substances against the concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example of this is up the concentration
gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this looks like here is if we look
at our membrane, and we have a high ion
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration here, and a low ion
concentration up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, if the process of regular
diffusion, just passive transfer of
[SPEAKER_00]: materials occurred, these materials would
diffuse across the membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, because we're looking at active
transport, this is where we're using
[SPEAKER_00]: energy, ATP, to pull these ions,
even though there's a low concentration of
[SPEAKER_00]: them, pull them across the membrane and
force them over here, even though they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like you not wanting to go
to class and being out in the hall after
[SPEAKER_00]: passing time, and someone has to come grab
you and bring you into class with all your
[SPEAKER_00]: fellow students.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an example of active transport
moving against the concentration gradient
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's a low amount of
concentration and being pulled across to
[SPEAKER_00]: this area of higher concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be advantageous to the cell if
they need this particular ion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, active transport requires the use
of carrier proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two types.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be a membrane pump or coupled
transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: So membrane pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see the word pump, think of a
normal pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a water pump requiring
electricity, requiring energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be petroleum products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part here is requiring energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In coupled transport, we're going to talk
about our co-transport systems here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, our active transport requiring
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ion pumps, they could move.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are sodium ions, potassium ions,
calcium ions, magnesium ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium and sodium exchange pump is a
very common pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: These proton pumps are moving hydrogen
ions, as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It uses photosynthesis or food energy to
create a proton concentration gradient
[SPEAKER_00]: that then is used to manufacture ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this higher hydrogen ion concentration,
this higher proton concentration,
[SPEAKER_00]: is what's being generated here and forced
through ATP synthase here to generate ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to generate our ATP,
we need our protons to want to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher concentration in this external
environment, in this internal membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving them across and forcing them over,
in this case, is allowing them us to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest the energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we see this example here,
and we see a lot of folds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember our surface area to volume ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of folds here indicate this could be
what a mitochondria does.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mitochondria is forcing concentration
of gradients and then harnessing that
[SPEAKER_00]: energy through its particular protein,
passing it only through one way,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as a result, taking ADP and a free
phosphorus to generate ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So proton pump moving hydrogen ions and
photosynthesis, when we go over that,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll see that in more detail,
or food energy, to create this proton
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration gradient that then is used
to manufacture ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's a lot of protons here,
they want to diffuse across the cell and
[SPEAKER_00]: it lets them go through one area,
and that's ATP is generated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking a little bit more at the membrane
pumps, carrier proteins use energy from
[SPEAKER_00]: ATP to move substances across the membrane
up its concentration gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a high amount of potassium ions
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see only one on this side.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pump is pumping them, in this case,
across, requiring energy to move them
[SPEAKER_00]: across, moving that concentration
gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see again, here's our potassium
coming in, and here's our sodium leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see ATP being broken down, indicating
energy is being required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sodium potassium pump is one active
transport system that's very common in
[SPEAKER_00]: cells, and again, it's moving the sodium,
which is the Na plus here, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium, which is the K, and there's
binding, and again, this is just
[SPEAKER_00]: representing a protein requiring energy
for this to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Active transports, carrier mediated,
one ATP, so one energy molecule,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, right here, is moving three sodiums
out and two potassiums in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not always an equal number
transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are our binding sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have three green molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, these represent the sodiums,
and two orange represent the potassium,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this ATP is causing this movement
across.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a transmembrane potential,
because it's creating electrical charge
[SPEAKER_00]: across the membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So across the membrane is transmembrane,
and this potential is an electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because these are both ions,
and they're moving not in equal amounts,
[SPEAKER_00]: causing a shift in the amount of charges
that occur on one side or the other side
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our proton pump, again,
mitochondrial membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cellular respiration, the proton pump
uses energy to transfer protons from the
[SPEAKER_00]: matrix of the mitochondria to
intermembrane space.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're simply taking our hydrogen ions,
and we're concentrating them on one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to diffuse across.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't get through this phospholipid
bilayer, but they can get through this ATP
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's this big black molecule here,
and because they're moving through,
[SPEAKER_00]: as they're moving through, they sell,
in this case, the ATP synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's harnessing that energy, and it's
using that flow of protons to take ADP
[SPEAKER_00]: plus the phosphorus to train ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an active pump that generates
proton concentration across the
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondrial membrane, because there are
more protons outside the matrix than
[SPEAKER_00]: inside, and that's the environment here
forcing them through.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of the reason why
mitochondria have so many folds in them,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're having a lot of these ATP
synthases in the membranes, allowing a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of energy to be generated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The co-transport mechanism here,
capable of moving substances either with
[SPEAKER_00]: or against their concentration gradients,
the key two terms here are symporters and
[SPEAKER_00]: antiporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uniporter, one-porter, just moving one
thing in one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Binding here, it's being released and
pushed to the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our co-transporter ports are a little
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We classify them in two ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example here, we have our symporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two substances move across membrane in the
same direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing, same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same co-transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: A and B on this side of the cell membrane
are being moved to the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, antiport system, just as the name
implies, two substances move across
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane in the opposite direction,
some anti-directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also called a counter-transport
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here the triangles moving this way,
and the green squares moving to the other
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case here, we see them both
binding to our protein, and they're both
[SPEAKER_00]: being released on the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this helps explain some
transmembrane proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
