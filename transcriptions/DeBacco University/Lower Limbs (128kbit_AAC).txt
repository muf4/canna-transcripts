[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to be looking at
the lower limbs here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here with the Wikovitch of the
West, lower limbs bone structure may not
[SPEAKER_00]: be matching what we're going to be
discussing here, but here's what we are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what we need to call the leg
bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the lower limbs, this has a nice
kind of listing of some of the major bones
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They consist of the thigh, the leg,
and the foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bones of the lower limb are the
femur, the patella, the tibia,
[SPEAKER_00]: and fibula.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tarsals, metatarsals, and phalanges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those might be terms you might be
familiar with or may not be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The femur is basically your thigh bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patella is your kneecap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tibia and fibula are the bones of the
lower leg here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tarsals are the bones of the ankle,
and metatarsals and phalanges are bones of
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with that femur,
that largest bone there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the upper leg, and it's the
largest bone in the human body and also
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the strongest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of pressure to kind of deal
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The femoral head articulates with the
pelvis to form the hip joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shaft descends in a slightly medial
direction that's designed to bring the
[SPEAKER_00]: knees closer to the body's center of
gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps increase your stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these bones, while they may
look perfectly straight, are not that way
[SPEAKER_00]: on purpose to help with the basic geometry
for maintaining stability or increased
[SPEAKER_00]: strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distantly, the femur exhibits two rounded
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the farthest point down here,
and they articulate with the tibia in the
[SPEAKER_00]: most anterior projection of the patella.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's getting into that knee region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that patella region, as we just left
the femur here at the bottom, that
[SPEAKER_00]: patella, patella is basically the knee or
the kneecap, and it's the bone between the
[SPEAKER_00]: fibula and the femur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two main functions is to protect the knee
from physical trauma, and it acts as also
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a leverage of the quadriceps and
tendon can exert on the femur,
[SPEAKER_00]: thereby increasing the muscle efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we see another bone being placed
to only protect portions of the body,
[SPEAKER_00]: that delicate joint, but also increasing
muscle efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tibia and fibula of the leg here,
so we're kind of in that lower leg region,
[SPEAKER_00]: the tibia is the smaller fibula bones
comprise the lower leg and articulate with
[SPEAKER_00]: the knee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tibia is the thicker bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of think of it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people confuse the tibia and the
fibula.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fibula is the smaller one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tibia, if you think T and thicker,
that can help you remember that in a quick
[SPEAKER_00]: visual comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spans the lower leg, articulates
approximately with the femur and patella
[SPEAKER_00]: at the knee joint, and distally with the
tarsals bones at the ankle joint that's
[SPEAKER_00]: down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a major weight-bearing bone of the
leg because it is the thicker one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fibula, you can think of being
fragile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the thinner one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also spans the lower leg, and although
approximately does not articulate with the
[SPEAKER_00]: femur or the patella, it's located right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Serves more as an attachment point for
muscles rather than a weight-bearing bone,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's why it tends to be more
fragile.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thicker tibia is doing most of the
weight-bearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the tarsals and metatarsals and
the phalanges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in humans, the ankle and foot bones
include the tarsals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your actual ankle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metatarsals are kind of your middle bones,
and the phalanges are the actual toes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like very similar to analogous
kind of being in your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see those same terms, the phalanges,
fingers, and toes being given here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to make that distinction
of where you are talking about when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using that particular term.
