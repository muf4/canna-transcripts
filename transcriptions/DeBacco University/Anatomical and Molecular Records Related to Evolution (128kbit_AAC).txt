[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm going to go through some of
the anatomical and molecular records
[SPEAKER_00]: related to evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it as some of the macroscopic and
some of the microscopic records related to
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, we have the presence of
vestigial organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're structures that are no longer in
use, such as the human appendix and wisdom
[SPEAKER_00]: teeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apes have much larger appendix that's
involved with the digestive process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these structures and we can easily
live without them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is evidence that they may have been
used at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, if we're born without them,
we have no negative effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molecular records will evolutionary
distance is one, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: New alleles arise by mutations that come
from predominance through favorable
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, we have this kind of
population before.
[SPEAKER_00]: After selection, we have the favor of the
red circles instead of the yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could relate to the resistance level
of something going on in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For whatever reason, the dark gray is
favored over the white coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we look at specifically these
molecular records and this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: divergence that is occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at kind of degrees of
divergence or how dissimilar two species
[SPEAKER_00]: may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evolutionary changes involve the continual
accumulation of genetic changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distance-related organisms accumulate in
greater number of evolutionary differences
[SPEAKER_00]: than closely related ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: This divergence is seen among vertebrates
in the 146 amino acid hemoglobin beta
[SPEAKER_00]: chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that kind of mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at hemoglobin, which humans,
monkeys, dogs, birds, frogs, and even sea
[SPEAKER_00]: lampreys have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing the amount of amino acids that are
different between this hemoglobin
[SPEAKER_00]: polypeptide compared to the human.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, the monkey has eight
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dog has 32, the bird 45, the frog 67
different amino acids, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: lamprey 125.
[SPEAKER_00]: This indicates that while all of these
organisms have hemoglobin, the lamprey is
[SPEAKER_00]: by far the most dissimilar because of its
high degree of variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the frog and the bird are more
distantly related to humans than the dog
[SPEAKER_00]: or the monkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at our molecular clock
and the difference between these.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same pattern of divergence is seen
with DNA sequences, such as at the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytochrome C gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this kind of refer to and
mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we have millions of years and
nucleotide substitutions, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: changes appear to accumulate at a
consistent rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This phenomenon is referred to as the
molecular clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means as mutations are occurring at a
relatively consistent rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note different proteins evolve at
different rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more complex we have, the least
amount of differences compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: greater amount of differences we have
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have, again, the human,
the pig, the duck, snake, fish,
[SPEAKER_00]: and moth species in the east.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these large divergence here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the molecular clock,
the degree of nucleotide substitutions
[SPEAKER_00]: that are occurring over this period of
time, we're seeing some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency to that pattern over a long
period of time, indicating this molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also something called homology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the eyes of these organisms are not
homologous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first kind of key point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the genes controlling the eyes are
homologous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's kind of look at this in more
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we are comparing the genetic
similarity to protein similarity of an
[SPEAKER_00]: eye-controlled gene across species,
that's what we're looking at in specifics
[SPEAKER_00]: here, the mouse is the comparison
standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, the genetic similarity and
the protein similarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So protein similarity to the mouse between
the eye of the mouse, the shark,
[SPEAKER_00]: the squid, and the flatworm is all 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what's different is the genetic
similarity to the mouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gets into genotype and phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genetic similarity to the mouse,
the shark only is 85%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The squid's a little over 78%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flatworm's 71.6%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing that there is some genetic
variability, even though this protein is
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this indicates, remember, there's
multiple ways you can make the same
[SPEAKER_00]: protein get to the same amino acid with
different genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetic code, different RNA,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within this molecular record, looking at
500 million years ago, an ancestor
[SPEAKER_00]: involved a switch for eye development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably a simple type of eye,
one pigment cell, one photoreceptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gene was passed on to its
descendants, and these descendants
[SPEAKER_00]: involved more complex eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we have this kind of light and
dark sensing, well, that's one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's more complexities being
developed, this is a way that that gene
[SPEAKER_00]: can be modified to development of kind of
the complexity to the eyes, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can sense a lot more than just light
and dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have lenses, colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of complexity just within
the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, again, shows that kind of basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's neurofibers and photoreceptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, getting to the development of a
retina, getting to the development of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cornea, developing a lens, being able to
kind of sense objects at different
[SPEAKER_00]: distances, being with night vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on what animal you're looking
at, a lot of complexities here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at dinosaurs as well, we could see
this high degree of complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's occurring and divergence between
them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have definitely a change that occurred
where a lot of them went extinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why did that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what, they clearly did not best
fit that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this just shows you that progression
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now molecular evidence, we have DNA-DNA
hybridization, it's called, where DNA is
[SPEAKER_00]: separated with sufficient heat to create
single strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: These then closely related sequences will
join together or what we call hybridize.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll stick together.
[SPEAKER_00]: More strongly since there are more
complementary bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of take the DNA, we kind of
separate it out, and we see what it may
[SPEAKER_00]: stick to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The closer the sequences are related,
the higher the melting temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: the TM, will be required to separate
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a kind of a way to tell this
hybridization how similar the genetics may
[SPEAKER_00]: be, because if they're more similar,
they're going to be bound tighter and take
[SPEAKER_00]: more heat to get them to separate out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now whale evolution is something else to
kind of look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: The evolution of whales beginning with
their ancestor, their descendants of
[SPEAKER_00]: terrestrial animals return to the seas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another example of evolution
doesn't mean getting more complex
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whales, distant relatives may have been
land-based with walking, and they may have
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly reduced those limbs to become more
flipper-like and to become more fin-like
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to best fit the aquatic
environment versus the terrestrial one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of evolutionary critics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seven principles of objectives,
that they have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not exactly demonstrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no fossil intermediates.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's intelligent design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evolution violates the second law of
thermodynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proteins are too improbable to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these objections are really without a
great scientific merit when you start
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at them to be kind of supported.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people bring up religion related
to evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just looking at Pope John Paul II
in November 19, 1996, an address that he
[SPEAKER_00]: made regarding evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the Catholic Church and evolution
tend to be thought to be very much
[SPEAKER_00]: conflict.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he stated that today almost half a
century after the publication of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Euclidean, new knowledge has been led to
the recognition of more than a hypothesis
[SPEAKER_00]: in a theory of evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's indeed remarkable that the theory has
been progressively accepted by researchers
[SPEAKER_00]: following a series of discoveries in
various fields of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes on to say the convergence neither
sought nor fabricated of the results of
[SPEAKER_00]: work was conducted independently and is
itself a significant argument in favor of
[SPEAKER_00]: the theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind it is a theory,
but in science theory is a very well
[SPEAKER_00]: established, well supported idea or
concept versus a theory that we may be
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with more in common everyday
world.
