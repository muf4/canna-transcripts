[SPEAKER_00]: A very common method of drying cannabis is
simply putting it out to hang to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on this tobacco university video,
I'm going to go over some of the details
[SPEAKER_00]: of plant hanging for efficient drying,
as well as show you some examples of
[SPEAKER_00]: actual cannabis plants going through that
drying process so you can make sure it
[SPEAKER_00]: applies to your particular growing
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into plant hanging drying system
regarding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see a drying room with some
cannabis being hung out to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We noticed that there is a lot of space
between the different areas here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is allowing good air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the fan running in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see temperature, humidity controls
here, very clean environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of giving you an indication
of what a true drying system operating at
[SPEAKER_00]: peak efficiency should look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the drying process is critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after all the work of growing and
harvesting, the goal is to maximize the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of the end product you're going to
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you cannot create high quality end
product in the drying process,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can certainly lose what started out as
a high quality product if you do not
[SPEAKER_00]: perform this correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of growers spend a lot of time
worrying about nutrients and plant care
[SPEAKER_00]: and pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, make sure you're also putting the
effort into a proper drying process to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow that final drying process of the
final product to show its true qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this hang drying method is very
commonly implemented and it's considered
[SPEAKER_00]: by some to be the preferred method for
preserving bud conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the quick method at time of harvest,
it does not require high labor investment
[SPEAKER_00]: of time to manicure the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the reasons why it's so
advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several buds in the same branch can also
dry together as we saw in the previous
[SPEAKER_00]: image, making it also a very efficient
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, different growers may choose to
remove different amounts or percentages of
[SPEAKER_00]: fan leaves but again, that amount does
offer the grower an option for the drying
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the hang drying downfall,
there's no method is absolutely perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this method does require that there's
plenty of space to allow not only the
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging of branches, but also sufficient
airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have all your branches
all packed in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that there is
sufficient airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see down in Iowa, above the
plants, below the plants, all of those are
[SPEAKER_00]: important areas to allow that air to be
able to mix evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be space between the branches
and also between the rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure not to overpack a dry room
because it's going to cause uneven drying,
[SPEAKER_00]: inconsistent drying and issues in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it can be cut and hung, but not
advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some growers will elect to take the
whole plant, cut it and immediately dry
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while each bud does not need
individual attention to the degree that
[SPEAKER_00]: the rack system would require,
talked about in another video,
[SPEAKER_00]: there should be some time spent to remove
some of the leaves around the buds on a
[SPEAKER_00]: branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is possible to simply cut the branch
from the original plant or even just cut
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant down and hang it for drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though this is not often advised,
as we see here, can be done, but not
[SPEAKER_00]: usually advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some care should be taken to remove at
least some of the fan leaves as this will
[SPEAKER_00]: help ensure an even and consistent drying
process and also reduce the initial
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity that will need to be regulated in
the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, you want to keep the
humidity as particular region,
[SPEAKER_00]: particular range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have dehumidifiers to
remove some of those fan leaves that are
[SPEAKER_00]: not needed anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're reducing the stress on the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your system can be able to maintain
those target humidity levels a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a dry hanging myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard some growers say that when
hanging the plants upside down,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant components will not,
and I stress the word not, drain into the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds that they're fixed in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, oh, drying upside down,
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the good kind of leftover cannabinoids
and terpenes, they're all going to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of work their way down through and
with gravity end up in the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fixed in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why we hang them upside down
here is simply because the ease and
[SPEAKER_00]: simplicity of this method, not because
we're using gravity to force anything down
[SPEAKER_00]: to the bottom here and concentrate it in
the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That simply is not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you want to be cautious of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're seeing that same image at
the beginning with the lights off,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it is mostly kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the hanging, drying method,
the spacing of plants for the purposes of
[SPEAKER_00]: increased air circulation also means
they'll be exposed evenly to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep that light minimal,
both the intensity as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that duration of light should be
minimum in the sense that you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to always keep them in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to run in there and get
something, go through something,
[SPEAKER_00]: go right ahead, but keep the lights on for
the least amount of duration and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not turning all the lights on,
just a minimum amount of light that you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to get in and get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind this does not mean that we
kept 100% dark the entire time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just be aware that light exposure,
they are getting it and keep it to a
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers will say, oh, I don't want to
go in there today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they're drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have to, then don't,
but don't think that you're forbidden from
[SPEAKER_00]: that area during the drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it short, keep it quick and it should
be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's go into and let's take a look at
a real world example of looking at some
[SPEAKER_00]: canvas that is going through the drying
process with this hang and dry method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully this will allow you to see a
couple of slightly different systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: the consistencies amongst them to see if
it applies to your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're noticing a plant that's
recently been harvested, flipped upside
[SPEAKER_00]: down, and it is now in the drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, while it is efficient to
flip them upside down and to dry them and
[SPEAKER_00]: to hang them this way, it does not
increase any of the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's common misconception.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they flip it outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all the good chemicals and juices
and terpenes all kind of get to the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're locked in the plant where they're
going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just very efficient, kind of easy,
able to hang them easily able to stack a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot in a small area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great way to go through and
dry your plants, but don't think by drying
[SPEAKER_00]: them this way, it's going to increase any
cannabinoids that might be in the stems
[SPEAKER_00]: and work their way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's simply not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this shows some nice drying here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're noticing, uh, this is all came from
the field and we noticed it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging on this deer netting, creating a
nice little area here down the hallway,
[SPEAKER_00]: which really helps drive very efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also creates a very nice visual effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The deer netting where we're drying all
the cannabis buds and the actual wall
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is important to maintain this
because we do want to have a certain gap
[SPEAKER_00]: here to allow air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: To come through the hallway is on this
side, but we did not put these up here
[SPEAKER_00]: against the wall, which is a good thing
because you do want to have that even air
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation to allow efficient drying and
also even drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they come on this side,
you can see the hallway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of get that hallway,
like the wizard of Oz kind of look to it
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're looking at the Emerald city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and here we have a nice green area
with all the cannabis buds drying and
[SPEAKER_00]: drying in a way that looks very nice and
also is very efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're seeing some cannabis that's
recently been harvested and is now looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at being dried, ready for the next stage
of processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by going through and hanging it like
this, we see a very efficient way to dry
[SPEAKER_00]: it, uh, and keep everything consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice how there's space under,
underside everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a walkway.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got humidity monitoring,
trying to maintain consistent conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot of air moving in this area,
all very important as well as the muted
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting to help again, us monitor the
plants, but also ensure that we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting direct sunlight on them that might
be doing any damage to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
