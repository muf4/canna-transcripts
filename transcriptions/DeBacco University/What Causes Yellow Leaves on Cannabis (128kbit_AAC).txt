[SPEAKER_00]: Ever wonder what causes yellowing leaves
in your cannabis plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this tobacco university video will
provide you with a quick visual guide and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can search the channel once you have
an idea of what deficiency your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: might be experiencing to get more detail
on that particular deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to give you a brief overview of
what causes yellow leaves on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, there are many potential
causes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted you to realize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while there may be a long list of
potential causes for just yellowing
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, this will attempt to provide some
common nutrient-related causes for that
[SPEAKER_00]: yellowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The location of the yellowing leaves is
important to try and determine the likely
[SPEAKER_00]: cause so you can implement corrective
measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, with all these,
search the channel for more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, if you have yellowing
towards the top of the plant, like these
[SPEAKER_00]: two images show, this is likely an iron
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to know how to correct that
iron deficiency, again, there's more
[SPEAKER_00]: videos on all of these deficiencies here
on Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people confuse though this iron
deficiency with nitrogen and that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: The upper leaves are yellowing both early
and later stages in growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellowing the plant leaves towards the
edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we see all these, the edge of the
leaves here is what's exhibiting that
[SPEAKER_00]: yellowing or in severe cases browning.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is usually a characteristic of what's
a potassium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit more common in the lower
leaves and a little bit more common later
[SPEAKER_00]: in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the interveinal yellowing
where we're having that kind of in between
[SPEAKER_00]: the veins, we're having that yellowing
that is occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more characteristic of a magnesium
deficiency and also commonly found more so
[SPEAKER_00]: on the lower leaves of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have yellowing of just those
lowering leaves in a solid kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: coloration of yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: No real pattern, just all of the leaves
kind of turning yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is indicative of a nitrogen
deficiency where the tops remain green and
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottoms yellow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen is a mobile nutrient and it can
translocate through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant is actually stealing it out
of these older lower leaves and pushing it
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the upper growth or the newer
leaves there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the newer leaves remain green,
lower leaves remain yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this is a very brief overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see something that looks familiar,
search the channel so you can correct that
[SPEAKER_00]: issue in your particular plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
