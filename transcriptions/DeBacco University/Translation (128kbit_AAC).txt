[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at the process of
translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here we're looking at maybe
translating one language into another
[SPEAKER_00]: language, back into the original language.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to look at translation in
this lecture series, is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: converting our mRNA sequence into an
actual protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we talk about translation,
we have to go over transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this refers back to the central dogma
of biology, where we're looking at DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: being replicated and transcribed and then
translated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transcriber, just like we see here,
someone typing on an old typewriter,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the process of taking DNA and
transcribing it into RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the process through RNA
polymerase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It binds to one DNA strand at the site
called the promoter region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the promoter region is kind of like the
initial like goat region.
[SPEAKER_00]: It moves along the DNA, pairing
complementary nucleotides and then
[SPEAKER_00]: disintegrates at the stop signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here, here's our DNA,
a double-stranded DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the sense strand, and here's
our mRNA and our RNA polymerase in this
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking a double-stranded region,
taking one particular sequence here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we are now producing an mRNA sequence
that will then be used in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this process of transcription,
the promoter region is where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: starting, and we're transcribing our DNA
into our mRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, keep in mind, DNA contains
thiamine and RNA will contain uracil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting to the actual translation,
what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's converting the order of nucleotides
of a gene into the order of amino acids in
[SPEAKER_00]: the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: mRNAs are the blueprint or copies of the
nuclear genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: mRNAs are read by the ribosomes in three
nucleotide units called codons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each three nucleotide sequence codes for
an amino acid or a stop signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at this again here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're transcribing our DNA to our RNA,
and we're translating our RNA to our
[SPEAKER_00]: actual amino acid sequence that will
ultimately generate our proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind these codons are these three
coding regions, and we don't read
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily each individual nucleotide one
at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually look at them in groups of
three, and these codons are what's
[SPEAKER_00]: referred to as generating the particular
amino acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see here our ribosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the protein-making factories of
the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have a large and a small subunit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use mRNA to direct the assembly of a
protein, and a ribosome is made up of two
[SPEAKER_00]: subunits, each composed of our RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to go back and refer to the
types of RNA lecture, you're more than
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome to because a lot of that comes
back and is involved here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see our tRNA sequences,
our mRNA, and this ribosome is made mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: by weight, at least, of our RNA,
which is ribosomal RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the basic process of making a protein,
the mRNA binds to a small ribosomal
[SPEAKER_00]: subunit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The large subunit joins to the complex,
forming a complete ribosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that large and that small subunit
join together, and that little gap in
[SPEAKER_00]: between there where the mRNA is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mRNA threads through the ribosome,
producing the polypeptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember polypeptide, polypeptide,
many peptide bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peptide bonds are what hold or link the
amino acids together, and a collection of
[SPEAKER_00]: amino acids will form, hopefully,
a functional protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So transfer RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: These bring amino acids to the ribosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have our anticodon region binding to
the mRNA, these three base pairs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and at the 3' end here, where the hydroxyl
group is, is where the amino acid will be
[SPEAKER_00]: attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the anticodon region,
again, binding to the mRNA, and the 3' OH
[SPEAKER_00]: is where the amino acid will be attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does look like a basic T-type
structure, and that's where it gets the
[SPEAKER_00]: name transfer RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like it's transferring,
but it also has a T-like shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: The normal process, here's our DNA,
transcription, transcribed to our RNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: translated to a protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: These large letters, capital letters,
represent different amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the genetic code converting a codon to
an amino acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important that you know how to read
and produce the proper amino acid giving
[SPEAKER_00]: the codon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember these occur in threes,
so you want to take the first letter and
[SPEAKER_00]: use this column here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll just say, for example,
the first letter was an A.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to put you into this row
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to do the second letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say it was a U.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in this row.
[SPEAKER_00]: The U will put us in this column where
they intersect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in this box right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third letter, if it was a G,
we're going to be in this row,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this column, and in this specific box
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be AUG.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be the C start codon here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice if our codon was UGA,
we would go U, we'd find G, we'd find A,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we see that corresponds with a stop
codon located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it could also be UAA, U, A,
and A.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would also be a stop codon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And UAG would be another stop codon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some redundancies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here there's a bunch that also
represent the same amino acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in certain cases, and technically rare
cases, we have some that encode for only
[SPEAKER_00]: one amino acid or only a couple encode for
the same amino acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as many redundancies there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a typical square or box type.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also is a very similar type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same but different, I call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in a circular format.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you'd start with the first letter in
the middle, and you'd work your way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you remember back here, some of our
stop codons, UAG, U to A to G,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this black circle means it's a stop
codon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our start codon was AUG, so we want to
find our A for our first letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our U, and here's our G,
and here's our start codon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see it reads basically the same
way, just presented in a slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: different form.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic process of our transcription,
remember our DNA, we're transcribing it to
[SPEAKER_00]: four form our mRNA, and our mRNA gets
translated into a basically an amino acid
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence producing a protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same basic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So necessary components for translation,
remember that's mRNA to a protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need our ribosomes, we need our tRNA,
we need our mRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember here's our anticodon region here
would be our amino acid, which would be
[SPEAKER_00]: very specific to that particular codon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would be our ribosome here,
where basically the protective structure
[SPEAKER_00]: is allowing this process to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now ribosomes and subunits attach and
start the translation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, MET is our start codon.
[SPEAKER_00]: tRNA carrying the first amino acid is
paired with the start codon of the mRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an A site, a P site, and an E site.
[SPEAKER_00]: The A site holds the tRNA carrying to the
next amino acid sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So A is kind of the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: P site holds the tRNA carrying the growing
amino acid chain, it's in the middle,
[SPEAKER_00]: and E site is where the tRNA exits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So A you could think is the first letter
in the alphabet where it starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: P site is kind of the middle one.
[SPEAKER_00]: E site is where it's exiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our A or P, and this would be
our E site here exiting out the tRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind when that tRNA is exiting,
it no longer has an amino acid attached to
[SPEAKER_00]: it, because I added it to the polypeptide
chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to go out and find another amino
acid and bind to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amino acids are joined by a peptide bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: These proteins are polypeptides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're made of many peptide bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're linked together with this bond,
and the first tRNA is released that is now
[SPEAKER_00]: missing the amino acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to go back and find that amino acid
before it can bind and come back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the same basic picture presented
slightly differently so you can hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: see the similarities and see the
differences are being developed a better
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ribosome continues along the mRNA
until the second tRNA is in the P site,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this allows the process to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this continual binding,
this linking, it's kicking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming back, repeat, repeat, repeat down
the whole messenger RNA sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growing peptide chain, if you notice,
the ribosome moves along the mRNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: and amino acids are continually added to
the ever-growing polypeptide chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stop codon detaches the polypeptide
sequence, and the last tRNA is released,
[SPEAKER_00]: resulting in the dissociation of the
ribosome subunits.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means we see is the same ball
here, but if we look back and remember at
[SPEAKER_00]: some of our previous images, there's
actually two subunits, we have our larger
[SPEAKER_00]: subunit, and basically stop region is
causing these to fall apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they fall apart, they release the
linear chain of amino acids, the
[SPEAKER_00]: polypeptide chain, where it can hopefully
go full to form a functional protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Translation process summary, again,
it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our initiation step, we have our
elongation step, we're basically growing
[SPEAKER_00]: that chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here we have our termination step,
our release factor, we have our AUGs at
[SPEAKER_00]: stop codon, and then the parts are
recycled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because these amino acids are growing
here, and just because all of a sudden our
[SPEAKER_00]: two rRNAs, our two ribosomal subunits,
dissociate, doesn't mean they're
[SPEAKER_00]: completely wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are allowed to reform and go through
the process again.
[SPEAKER_00]: These amino acids that are given up by the
tRNAs are used for the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, this tRNA that's released has
to go and find another amino acid and bind
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tried to process it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be familiar with this translation process,
and basically this is how proteins are
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: How this may look, DNA transcription to
translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw this in the DNA replication,
so you can see a very similar pattern
[SPEAKER_00]: here, except we're only forming a single
chain here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're noticing the presence of uracil,
indicating we're making RNA from our DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see our single strand forming here,
going right down and right along our DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our mRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This occurs in the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're exiting out the nucleus now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the cytoposm of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our two subunits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our tRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our bonds being formed,
our peptide bonds being formed,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're linking, putting together our
amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, we're forming a protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice that all of these are different
amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all coding and reading these three
codon sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, at the very end, this is our stop
codon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see our ribosomes dissociate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This moves on to another ribosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our peptide chain, hopefully
forming into a functional protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, structure determines function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Translation process summary again,
same basic process as we saw there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our two subunits binding to the
mRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: TRNAs are coming in, linking a bunch of
amino acids together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, the release factor or stop
codon causes a new protein to basically be
[SPEAKER_00]: formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great link here if you want to
look from DNA to protein, a 3D model.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process continues until the stop codon
enters the A site and the ribosome complex
[SPEAKER_00]: falls apart and the protein is released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way to show the translation
process, keep in mind certain portions of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, that transcription portion,
occurs actually in the nucleus,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the ribosomes are located in the
cytoposm or outside the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This RNA sequence, this mRNA, must exit
out through the nuclear pores.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to hear different videos from
different presenters, I put a couple links
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're more than welcome to check those
out.
Thanks for watching.
