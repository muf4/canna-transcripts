[SPEAKER_00]: So in this DeBacco University video,
I'm going to add some information to the
[SPEAKER_00]: question, can tissue culture remove
hoplatin viroids from cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, something many growers are
asking, can tissue culture remove hoplatin
[SPEAKER_00]: viroids from cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into a little bit more of the
complexities of this as we answer this
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this does not mean you can stop testing
or screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is still a needed component.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a very important part of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: By testing plants that are infected,
they can be culled out as even tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture does not ensure a clean plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something a lot of growers I
think have a misconception on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think, oh, by this tissue culture,
I can remove that small number of cells
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I can remove the positivity of
that plant and I can clean that tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, culturing from a clean plant and
producing known clean plants is a method
[SPEAKER_00]: that can lead to kind of a clean facility
as you select out those that are infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing or screening should still occur if
you have employees that bring other plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material in, plan on keeping a plant as a
mother, and you know you still should have
[SPEAKER_00]: a clean facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep this in mind that testing is not
removed from the operation, even if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going with tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But looking specific at tissue culture,
is this kind of the answer to this viroid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on hops, it is possible to clean
tissue and eliminate the passage of the
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid to new tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to take some plants,
tissue culture them, and then don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to worry about this viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the portion of the plant,
the samples taken, and the cultivar being
[SPEAKER_00]: used for the plant cells all have an
impact on the effectiveness of this
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when multiple rounds are done
with testing or screening in between,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is possible to rid a line of this
viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is possible, but it's not
necessarily one and done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people think, I'm just going
to tissue culture it and I'll be all
[SPEAKER_00]: clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, even tissue cultured, that plant
could still potentially contain the
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're looking at sampling,
the meristem or the top portion would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: preferred region.
[SPEAKER_00]: With tissue culture, all you need is a
small number of cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where should you take them from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, meristem culture is the very top
portion here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more advantageous compared to using
material from a node.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is possible to get a nodal tissue
culture, but you want to really go for the
[SPEAKER_00]: meristem if you're worried about opulating
viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that the viral load can vary by
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people think this is because the
plant grows quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as the plant's growing up,
we're kind of outgrowing where that virus
[SPEAKER_00]: is trying to go through and run through
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could potentially, this may be true
to some extent, but in reality the viroid
[SPEAKER_00]: is not very far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're talking about that
meristem, that very, very top portion,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that viroid is also going to be
running through that plant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take that into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common location based on tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when inoculated, it's more likely to be
found above rather than below the initial
[SPEAKER_00]: point of infection, at least initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very common in roots and this may be
where it initially concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get a point of infection up
here, it will probably accumulate in the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots first and then work its way above
that point of infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over about six weeks,
the data seems to show it infects the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, people are looking to potatoes
because a lot of them are vegetative.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're often grown in tissue culture to
produce virus-free plant stock that will
[SPEAKER_00]: be used for a number of years and then
tissue culture to repeat the process to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure clean tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that cannabis is slightly
different, the viroid is slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: different, but this is something to
consider that other plants are being used
[SPEAKER_00]: as an initial protocol and is showing
potentially some effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now why that meristem region, or let's
look at a really close version which you
[SPEAKER_00]: may not have seen of that meristem region.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the actual growing point of that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very tip of the plant has the fastest
growing cells, a lot of mitosis occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may be able to outpace the growth or
spread of a virus, or in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: a viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a guarantee, but it does help
potentially increase the odds of
[SPEAKER_00]: generating viroid-free plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it should be taken from the
meristem and not the bud region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's kind of outrun it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not always true, but if you're going to
sample from a region, that's where I would
[SPEAKER_00]: target and then still test those plants
because they still may show positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take another meristem region, another
tissue culture around, and hopefully you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get a clean plant and to create clean
plant stock.
Thank you.
