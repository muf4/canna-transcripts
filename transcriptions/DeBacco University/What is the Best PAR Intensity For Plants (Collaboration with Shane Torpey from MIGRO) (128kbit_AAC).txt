[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to this DeBaco University video
with yet another collaboration with Shane
[SPEAKER_01]: from Migro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we're going to be looking at what the
best PAR intensity for plants is.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the image shows here, the PAR intensity
versus growth rate will be compared.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, we'll get into carbon dioxide
enrichment and how that impacts plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as DLI, the daily light integral,
and providing you with an easy equation to
[SPEAKER_01]: do some calculations to determine what you
are giving your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, welcome Shane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we've got Shane from MicroGrow
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to be discussing optimum
PAR intensity and DLI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, PAR intensity and PAR, we have
another video released and going into a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more in depth on what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're basically looking at the intensity
of light, of range of spectrums.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we're going to be looking at how it
relates to plants in a little bit more of
[SPEAKER_01]: a specific way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting with plants photosynthesize.
[SPEAKER_01]: With this PAR intensity, is this basically
the same needed, no matter what plant I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: growing Shane, or is there differences
with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are definitely differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants have developed in nature to succeed
in different environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, there are plants which are
optimized to grow with relatively low PAR
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants that would grow, for example,
on a forest floor, where there would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: For cannabis, cannabis is able to use high
PAR intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been shown that there is continuous
increase in photosynthesis all the way up
[SPEAKER_00]: to about 1500 micromoles of PAR intensity,
which is a high level, after which you get
[SPEAKER_00]: a reducing rate of return.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that intensity is important because
it is trying to maximize all of our plants
[SPEAKER_01]: in production.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're growing a plant that needs a
little less, we can cut back on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're growing a plant that needs a
little bit more, well, now we can justify
[SPEAKER_01]: that more intense light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, with lighting, we're typically
growing in indoor environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives some growers the option of
adding CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear a lot about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's PAR, the photosynthetic equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: How may that change things when related to
PAR light intensity and plant production?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are absorbing the photons from
light, and they're using that energy to
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesis uses CO2 as part of that
chemical reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having enriched CO2 so higher than would
be available in the normal atmosphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is about 400 parts per million,
you increase that CO2 level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a closed system, and you're
supplementing that CO2 with either CO2 gas
[SPEAKER_00]: or a burner or whatever system you're
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can enrich that level of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been demonstrated that enriching
that up to about 1,200 or 1,300 parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million can increase the relative growth
rate by up to 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the same light intensity and
environmental conditions and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, you can have a relative increase
of growth with concentrated CO2 up to 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is quite extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that CO2 can definitely,
with the light intensity, definitely help
[SPEAKER_01]: increase plant production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind, as growers, you have to keep
your water and nutrients and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: else supplemented as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But lighting and CO2 is a big part of that
photosynthetic equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when we're talking about this
intensity of light, we're not just giving
[SPEAKER_01]: them a burst or a flash of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that's brought up is called DLI,
which is looking more about the intensity
[SPEAKER_01]: of light or the summation of light that it
experiences, the plant has over a day or
[SPEAKER_01]: the lighting period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you go a little bit more about this
DLI, maybe how it's calculated and how
[SPEAKER_01]: growers can better understand how they can
apply this to the plants they're growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so when we measure PAR, we're
measuring PAR at a moment in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that PAR intensity is measuring the
photons, the intensity of the quantity of
[SPEAKER_00]: photons over a meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: DLI is actually measuring the amount of
PAR that will accumulate over the light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say, for example, you're running at a
12-hour light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're multiplying the 12-hour light cycle
by the number of minutes in that hour,
[SPEAKER_00]: by the number of seconds in those minutes
by the instantaneous PAR intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give an example, if you're running at
about 800 micro moles of PAR over a
[SPEAKER_00]: 12-hour day, that generally would equate
to around 40 DLI, which is considered on
[SPEAKER_00]: the upper end of what a plant can absorb
over one light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be used, for example,
in tomato growing if you're supplementing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also can be related to cannabis growth
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's important to keep in note if
you're growing a photoperiod-dependent
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and you're switching it from an
18-hour light day to a 12-hour light day,
[SPEAKER_01]: that will impact your DLI as growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where people will use more
intense lights and flowering to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: make up for that loss of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be aware, it can only go so high.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants can only utilize it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would add to that as well,
Matthew, that with regard to we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: typically cannabis growers will be growing
either photoperiod plants, which would be
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering on a 12-hour cycle, but they may
also be growing auto-flower plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: which growers would often have a 20-hour
light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, I would recommend a lower
average PAR intensity for auto-flower
[SPEAKER_00]: plants because they're growing over a
longer day cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, they're going to be
absorbing more over that longer cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: hence the lower light intensity
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some people have explained it to me
and tried to do the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about like a rain gauge.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much water are you accumulating over a
day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus how much is falling right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's falling right now would be the
PAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: DLI would be that accumulation over a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the lights go out, empty the can out,
and then you can go through and re-measure
[SPEAKER_01]: the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just giving them more in a burst,
like rainwater doesn't do much good for
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants, just like in light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you actually have the chance of
burning them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shane, thank you for the detailed
information there, a little good
[SPEAKER_01]: background there to hopefully allow our
growers to better understand some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: complexities to help improve the
efficiency of their growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
