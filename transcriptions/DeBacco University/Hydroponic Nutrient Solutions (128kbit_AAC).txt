[SPEAKER_00]: So while this short video lecture here
focuses on hydroponic nutrient solutions,
[SPEAKER_00]: many of this same concepts can be applied
to nutrient solutions in general for no
[SPEAKER_00]: matter what you're feeding even in soil
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hydroponic nutrient solutions,
the goal of those are designed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: readily plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: With precise control over plants can
flower faster and reduce the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: production time compared to soil-based
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these nutrient solutions are designed
to supply the plants with nutrients that
[SPEAKER_00]: are available very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, especially with hydroponics,
we want to be mindful of the pH that we
[SPEAKER_00]: are creating within that solution to make
sure not only is it being directly applied
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plants and available very quickly,
but it's in the pH range that helps or
[SPEAKER_00]: facilitates that uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you have water evaporating at a
high rate, this can lead to a more
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated solution, so be mindful of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have an area that's open like we
saw in the previous image here,
[SPEAKER_00]: this can cause evaporation to increase
quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, that can cause a more
concentrated solution because the water
[SPEAKER_00]: will be evaporating out, but the nutrients
will be remaining behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, with less volume of water,
the concentration level will go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good growers should be topping off
containers with water to dilute that
[SPEAKER_00]: solution so that you're maintaining the
proper PPM for delivering to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where water monitor comes into
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, good growers are knowledgeable about
their native water properties,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is important, instead of just
topping off with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some water may require a pretreatment,
either a pH adjustment or maybe adding RO
[SPEAKER_00]: water if your given conditions have too
high concentration of other unwanted
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium magnesium and other hard water
properties associated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, knowing what your native water
is, allowing you to adjust with precision
[SPEAKER_00]: and control can allow a more efficient
production, especially in hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making sure that nutrient solution is
dialed in is a great way to help improve
[SPEAKER_00]: yields and reduce time to harvest.
Thank you.
