[SPEAKER_00]: Here I want to describe how the complement
system and interferon help the immune
[SPEAKER_00]: system perform its function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see an example of the
complement system, what that looks like,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also what interferon looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with the complement, it's a
complement system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 20 different proteins,
you can kind of see them lined up here,
[SPEAKER_00]: that separately are inactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's a system.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these need to be in play in order
for the full effect to be initiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aggregate, or the collection of these,
is a form of a membrane attack complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this does is it kills invading
microbes by forming holes in the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, there's no set toxins,
there's no harsh proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just simply here creating this
complement, creating this hole in the
[SPEAKER_00]: phospholipid bilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a major mechanism for destroying
foreign substances in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our binding that occurs,
and this hole in the membrane is
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminating the cell's ability to regulate
its internal environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply eliminating that ability to
regulate its environment is what's causing
[SPEAKER_00]: that cell ultimately to die and be
destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The complement amplifies all aspects of
the inflammatory response, and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: our cells are immune to the complement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's unable to regulate,
for example, water, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: water could end and enter the cell at an
increased rate, causing it to swell and
[SPEAKER_00]: burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an example of how the
complement can cause invading cells to
[SPEAKER_00]: lyse by the immune system simply putting
in these proteins, limiting the cell's
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to regulate water, causing it to
swell up and burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interferon, typically abbreviated IFN,
genes that synthesize the interferon are
[SPEAKER_00]: activated when the host cell is invaded by
a virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interferon molecules leave the
infected cell and enter neighboring cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these little small red particles are
the interferon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interferon assimilates the neighboring
cells to activate genes for an antiviral
[SPEAKER_00]: protein and block viral production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could help the cell recognize that
and block viral production by destroying
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA and reducing protein synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also cause neighboring infected
cells to undergo apoptosis, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: programmed cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, interferon can also activate
immune cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interferons are cytokines that are
released by a cell infected with a virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the response of neighboring cells to
interferon helps stem the infection,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning by having this one infected cell,
by releasing this interferon, it's able to
[SPEAKER_00]: signal neighboring cells that can reduce
the duration and the spread of these virus
[SPEAKER_00]: particles within the human body.
Thank you.
