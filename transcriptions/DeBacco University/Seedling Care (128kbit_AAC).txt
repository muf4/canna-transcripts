[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming successful germination and
emergence, you're going to have a seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: to care for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured it would be important to go
and discuss how to properly take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: that seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ideally, four to nine or so days after
soaking your seeds, you should start to
[SPEAKER_00]: see a break in the surface and emergence
should occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first leaves you're going to see,
these are leaves located right here and
[SPEAKER_00]: here, are called cotyledons, or seed
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are smooth and have smooth margins
with no serrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves here and here, kind of in the
east-west direction, are called true
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the ones that look like the
normal leaves and the plant will continue
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cotyledons or seed leaves only show up
initially after emergence and then all the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves after that will be called true
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seedlings should be receiving light so
they can start to produce their own
[SPEAKER_00]: sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at about 18 hours of light,
but the key part is six hours of continual
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not need to use high output lights
for this stage of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seedlings actually produce less intense
light, kind of show here, kind of filtered
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be fluorescent lighting or
dimmed higher output lights used for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first two to three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do only have high intensity lights,
they can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be sure to keep them a good distance
away, typically at least three,
[SPEAKER_00]: four, even sometimes five feet away from
your seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dim them if possible or put shade netting
in between the light in your newly emerged
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fluorescence can be about six to 12 inches
away for the same result.
[SPEAKER_00]: The anatomy of the seedling is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look over here, we have our cotyledons.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are our seed leaves, true leaves,
and then below we'll have a taproot,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the main central root that comes
down and off that we'll have these small
[SPEAKER_00]: little root hairs which are very important
for nutrient and water absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caring for your new seedlings,
I can't overstress this enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: do not over-fertilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically seedlings do not need much
fertilizer at all and most growers will
[SPEAKER_00]: add too much nutrients or overly
concentrated mixture and burn their own
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have growers had all the shelves of all
the latest nutrients and they want to feed
[SPEAKER_00]: their seedlings right out of the get-go,
want to make sure it's very dilute if at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choosing the key part is they should be
receiving about 18 hours of continuous
[SPEAKER_00]: light and even moisture in a consistent
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more important than trying to
compensate with nutrients, which
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes will likely burn a small tender
seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to ask for pythium or damping
off, which can often occur in seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: trays or early on, especially if
overwhelmed or watering occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots of temperature is cold,
which is below 68 degrees Fahrenheit or 20
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Celsius will also encourage this
problem to occur and using a seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: heating mat is advised to get above that
temperature to avoid or reduce the chance
[SPEAKER_00]: of pythium wiping out an entire tray of
newly emerged seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping your seedling going, well,
fertilizing typically starts one to two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks after the initial emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over this initial week, diluted fertilizer
can slowly be added, but don't push the
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling along too much because you can
burn them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelp and humic acids are good sources to
start with as the odds of harm are
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The combination can be helpful to develop
in roots, especially growing in a
[SPEAKER_00]: soil-based medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irrigating your seedlings, the goal is
consistent moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much or too little water can cause
negative impacts on your seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Avoid excessive water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Place seedlings on a tray or grate to
allow good drainage to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monitor soil moisture and remember that
depending on what light source you use can
[SPEAKER_00]: also impact the amount of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using those high intensity lights,
they may dry out a little bit quicker and
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to keep those conditions as
consistent as possible for those
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes the process a little
complicated is that water nature of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant will change as it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of want to hit that nice average
middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Misting systems can be installed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Key part is to keep that environment as
consistent for those newly emerged
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to transplant seedlings,
so when roots fill or reach the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: the container, it's time for
transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, this is about three weeks to a
month after initial seed soaking is marked
[SPEAKER_00]: by two or three sets of true leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this depends on the size container
that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very small plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to keep your seedlings
under light to help prevent them from
[SPEAKER_00]: getting leggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want these to stretch out,
getting leggy so they get really tall,
[SPEAKER_00]: making flop over and develop weak stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The importance of these root hairs that I
mentioned, they're very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're single celled root hairs and
they're the mainstay of nutrient and water
[SPEAKER_00]: absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the importance of the plant is high,
so is the likelihood of damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only one cell thick, very
importantly, maintain as many of those as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to do that, we want to limit root
disturbance throughout the entire plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: life cycle with a high priority for
growers, especially in the transplant or
[SPEAKER_00]: early on phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transplanting is when these roots can be
very severely damaged or any sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbance, especially when the plant is
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light duration for our seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see the change in night length
or day length, depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: seasonality of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, you want that 16 to 18 hours of
light with that eight to six hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: continuous darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will also help keep the cannabis
plant in the vegetative state and not
[SPEAKER_00]: induce flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The type of light you use will determine
on the proper distance from the seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: for its maximum benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: No plants can be illuminated with a green
light, so plants cannot perceive this,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will count as areas of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part here is to maximize the plant
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to roam necessarily for 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers will, but the key part is if
you get under that 16 hours, the budding
[SPEAKER_00]: and flowering will be initiated even at
the seedling stage, and you want to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to encourage root growth,
so excessive water will literally
[SPEAKER_00]: suffocate roots because they need to
breathe and exchange oxygen and carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excessive water can also increase the odds
of root rots and soil pathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: damping off, pythium, cytophthora,
and all sorts of negative issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using that heat mat will help elevate the
soil temperature and improve root
[SPEAKER_00]: formation, but getting hotter than 90
degrees Fahrenheit will lead to reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you want a warm root zone,
but not a hot root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: As seedlings get older, you want to
establish adequate root system above the
[SPEAKER_00]: above ground portion will start to grow
exponentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to transition plant from
seedling to the vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often this requires repotting into larger
containers to reduce pot bound roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will stunt plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to avoid the situation where all
you see is roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this plant started in the
plug, went to a larger pot, and now is in
[SPEAKER_00]: an even larger pot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sequence of steps allows it to grow
out and fill those containers and allows
[SPEAKER_00]: for efficient packing of plants in a small
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, some people think, well,
why bother going through the transplanting
[SPEAKER_00]: of all these different plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not just start in a 10 gallon pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: That has many negative effects because 10
gallon pots take up a lot of space,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when you're talking about a
very small seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots may not be contained, so they will
not be forced more top growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots just kind of spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're heavy to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: They require a lot of media.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're rich soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't allow for root inspections
during the transplant process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can waste media if not properly sexed,
meaning if you're growing a lot of male
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why going through this process of
transplanting is not necessarily a bad
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's transitioning your newly emerged
seedling to getting ready for the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
