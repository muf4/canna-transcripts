[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over some steps
to prepare for harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like cooking, it's not about kind
of the end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to have a quality end product,
there's a lot of preparation that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go over some of that here for
cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So harvest plant preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to reduce fertilizer applications
about one to two weeks before harvest and
[SPEAKER_00]: then stop fertilizer applications about
one week or less before harvest to help
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid negative tastes and aromas that
could build up in the buds, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're playing the line really
close and you're not really over
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizing, you don't have to necessarily
stop this far in advance, but it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: good to kind of flush that plant out to
get rid of any excess buildup that you may
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're applying anything on the
leaves with foliar applications,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to stop these before you harvest,
as this may cause unwanted residues on the
[SPEAKER_00]: finished product of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while they may be helpful to your
plant, by applying them right up to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest and getting kind of the buds
sprayed, that can cause some negative
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts with residues remaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, preparing for harvest, flushing your
plants involves adding water to remove
[SPEAKER_00]: excess buildup of salts and fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be done about one week before the
planned harvest or two weeks, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on what media you may be using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using hydroponics, you can cut this window
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using soil or much larger mineral-based
material, you might want to go on that
[SPEAKER_00]: one, one and a half, maybe even two weeks
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to have water drain out of the
containers or flush through the root zone
[SPEAKER_00]: to provide a place for excess salts to go
and be removed from that root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flushing is different than just
watering the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watering, you're trying to keep that water
contained to the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flushing here, you're trying to get those
contents beyond the root zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the plant's reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Containers, it's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look for water to drain out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In soil-based conditions, field-based,
you want to make sure you're excessively
[SPEAKER_00]: watering to kind of get that to drain
below the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some indoor growers will turn the lights
off one to two days before harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: what they believe helps increase resin
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's no supporting evidence to
this other than anecdotal information,
[SPEAKER_00]: so just keep that in mind there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, just run the lights right up
to the end, and I think you'll have the
[SPEAKER_00]: same amount of resin production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overstressing the plants with no lights
might be unneeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, pre-harvest pruning a day before
harvest, you can remove large leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: stems to better expose the buds to make
the next day's process that much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, it is important to discard
the plant material and keep the area
[SPEAKER_00]: clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just prune off the leaves and let
them sit there, because it will dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to remove that from the grow
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're cutting leaves very close to
the buds, you may want to save those as
[SPEAKER_00]: part of a drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start that here a day early before
you remove the actual buds from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the important part is to just
remove that from the area so you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting dried buds and dried flowers
within the branches that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here to make the harvest process a little
bit more efficient with a good preparation
[SPEAKER_00]: procedure that you do follow.
