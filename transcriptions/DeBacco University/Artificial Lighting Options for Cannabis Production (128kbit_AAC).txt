[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBacco University video,
I'm going to go over artificial lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: options for cannabis production and give
you some of the pros and cons of some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the common artificial lighting sources
that you might be considering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ever wonder why there's so many
artificial lighting options, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some advantages and disadvantages
of each, which will be discussed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the goal of all grow lights
is to help plants grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole idea or concept behind
all the artificial lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different than typical room
lights because grow lights are based on
[SPEAKER_00]: the spectrum that is required by plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because we see a nice light that
looks nice, we want to make sure it's
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically designed for plants so it's
producing the spectrum and the wavelengths
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plants need to utilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So provided with a good reference article
here, looking at some artificial lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, all sources provided right here
if you want to look at it for yourself in
[SPEAKER_00]: greater detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at a variety of grow light
options, there are a wide range of bulb
[SPEAKER_00]: types that can be used as grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the general categories include
fluorescent lights, which are typically T5
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, high intensity discharge lamps or
HID lights, which include high pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: sodiums and ceramic metal halides,
and then light emitting diodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are your LED lights, which seem to
be getting very popular recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is just a nice little
comparison looking at the spectrum,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cost, power draw efficiency and
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go through here and provide
you with some advantages and disadvantages
[SPEAKER_00]: of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, before I get to the specifics of
the different types, we want to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: letting technology continues to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while technology continues to kind of
change over time, the degree of light
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy advancements varies by the light
type.
[SPEAKER_00]: LED lights show the greatest promise for
continued future improvements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot of leveling off in our many
of our other lights, such as the
[SPEAKER_00]: incandescence, the fluorescence,
the metal halides, but we see the LED
[SPEAKER_00]: light group being definitely one that is
kind of going against the general trend of
[SPEAKER_00]: leveling off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of exponential rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's where it's estimated to kind of
go to going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just something to take into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the distance between lights and the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see just a little example here
of some LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kind of see a measuring device here
to kind of get an idea how far that light
[SPEAKER_00]: is away from the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The distance between the lights and the
plants should be based on the intensity of
[SPEAKER_00]: the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be measured using a PAR PPFD
or PFD meter there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lower light output, the closer the
plants should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the higher the light output,
ideally the further the plant should be,
[SPEAKER_00]: simply to avoid the chance of leaf burn or
damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: To maximize yields, growers should keep
all plant factors, such as water,
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of carbon dioxide,
optimum levels, because cannabis can
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerate high levels of light,
which can help increase yields,
[SPEAKER_00]: assuming all other factors are not
limiting, including but not limited to
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at the first one here,
looking at our fluorescent lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the advantages of fluorescence is
that can be placed really close to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also not very expensive,
and the bulbs have a very long life of
[SPEAKER_00]: about 20,000 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages are that they
have a low light intensity, they use
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple bulbs per unit, and the disposal
of those bulbs can be a challenge because
[SPEAKER_00]: of some of the toxic metals that they
contain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going on to CMH or Cermak metal halide
lights, the advantage of those is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're easy replacements for a
fluorescent light setup, one bulb design
[SPEAKER_00]: with more spectrum options compared to the
fluorescence, and they also have a long
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why they're not used is that they're not
great for the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce a fair amount of heat and
also the disposal of their bulb as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it tends to be smaller, and it tends
to be less of them compared to a
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescent option.
[SPEAKER_00]: High pressure sodium lights can be used
for the entire grow season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it's not ideal for the
vegetative stage, it still can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prices have become very attractive,
meaning they've been reduced quite a bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's considered to be the industry
standard, so there's many reliable options
[SPEAKER_00]: with the high pressure sodium or HBS
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reason why some growers elect not to use
them is that their bulbs have a relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: short life of only about 5,000 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do produce a fair amount of heat,
and they have a limited spectrum there,
[SPEAKER_00]: so there's some disadvantage to high
pressure sodium lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, going on to LED lights,
the light emitting diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are full spectrum light, and they can
increase compounds that define high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have a very long life of
typically 50,000 hours or greater,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantage of LED lights is
the initial cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of variability currently on
the market, and the total coverage area
[SPEAKER_00]: per light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when investing in any light,
you want to make sure to do your research,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at everything extensively,
and make the best option that's a fit for
[SPEAKER_00]: your particular growing situation.
