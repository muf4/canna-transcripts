[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
we're going to go over direct soil
[SPEAKER_00]: planting of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to describe some of the
content, some of the key things,
[SPEAKER_00]: advantages and disadvantages to consider,
as well as show you this actually
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into direct soil
planting of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, seeds can be direct seeded,
but you do want to take some limitations
[SPEAKER_00]: with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while seeds can be direct seeded,
it's often not done with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: simply because of the elevated
temperatures that cannabis tends to prefer
[SPEAKER_00]: to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, it could be direct seeded,
but may not be the best practice,
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely depending on your location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seedlings or clones is typically what's
added to a field of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they may be originated from seeds,
but as far as going right in this soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: planting seeds, probably not initially at
least advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Direct soil planting, the advantage of
this practice is that it's the ease of
[SPEAKER_00]: planting and lack of need to supply
growing substrate from outside sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants can develop deeper root systems and
plants will often require less water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at kind of cannabis seeds as
to be kind of a good general collection
[SPEAKER_00]: here of what would be considered,
at least based on visual inspection,
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly higher quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see that nice darker brown,
some of that kind of like, it looks like a
[SPEAKER_00]: little veining-like appearance there,
a little shattered glass-like look,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that dark coloration there,
they should be pretty hard and solid
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to see a lot of white seeds
or a lot of tan seeds overall,
[SPEAKER_00]: simply because that darker brown indicates
that more fully developed seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the disadvantages of this kind of
method is that the soil does need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared ahead of time, and if the soil is
waterlogged, this can stunt the growth of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed control can also be an issue with any
outdoor operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, let's take a look at this kind of
process going through for direct seeding
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at the planting of
cannabis clones in soil and some seedlings
[SPEAKER_00]: here as well, and we can see that we're
setting up the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, field prep is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: There needs to be a lot of organization,
and that starts with getting your
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment ready ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be large equipment or it could
be very simple equipment as we see here,
[SPEAKER_00]: simply measuring devices, shovels,
rakes, the basic hand tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see everyone here getting ready on
the morning, going through and rock
[SPEAKER_00]: picking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the soil was very dry, so when we're
going through and roughing it up to till
[SPEAKER_00]: it initially, that's why you saw the
person there wetting the surface down just
[SPEAKER_00]: to reduce some of the dust there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see them chasing them with
the hose there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as we're going through and kind of
tilling that top layer, rock picking,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see on the left there that white
string, and we also have a little auger on
[SPEAKER_00]: a hand drill.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just going to initially set the
holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we keep the hole spaced?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's just a simple little stake
with a bamboo stake, and two people can
[SPEAKER_00]: easily go through and ensure that there's
consistency down that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: In spacing, because that's very important
when you're talking about field
[SPEAKER_00]: applications overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very large field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure holes are very
consistent because it gets very easy for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to get off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there we've completed one row,
and we've moved the string there to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at the field, we want to be
mindful of the edges of the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see a lot of rocks on the edges of
the field, and that indicates kind of what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're running into here in the main field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see those initial first two rows
there working right along, and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting the clones and seedlings right in
down the little line there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see everyone now working through
that initial area, finding sadly a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: more rocks I think than most people would
like to find when you're going through and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeding a particular field there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, working through, everyone's got
their little job to do and trying to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it nice, consistent, and efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you have to bring in some more
of that manual labor to kind of bring in
[SPEAKER_00]: and pull up some of those rocks,
but once you've got the holes dug,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can see the little cannabis plant right
there going right in, nice little valve
[SPEAKER_00]: root system right along the string,
and adding in some initial amendments to
[SPEAKER_00]: that planting hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then going through easily and covering it
up, making sure everything's nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, knowing how many plants you
have and the spacing of the holes is also
[SPEAKER_00]: very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will notice that they're hearing a lot
of that kind of ting-ting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of the rocks here in this
particular area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to remove as much of those as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to plan ahead as best as you can,
but trying to keep that spacing even.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the two containers there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like drinking glasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of are, but they're really meant
to ensure that the amendments added per
[SPEAKER_00]: planting hole are nice and consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be a perfect measure,
but kind of putting a mark there ensures
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's some sort of consistency
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also allows growers to plan in the sense
that they know exactly how much they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be utilizing, so they don't
overbuy certain amendments, other than
[SPEAKER_00]: just the right amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we're looking at that continuation of
the process going on, you can see a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people working through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, trying to have those tasks made
ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, finding more rocks than we'd like
to kind of initially thought we were going
[SPEAKER_00]: to run into, but everyone's got their job
to do, and it's going quite efficiently,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the best you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, this was a relatively cool
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the amount of rocks on the
side, which is an indication, sadly,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're going to run into.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's kind of one of the cannabis plants
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they're nice and consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were ready to go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were delivered on time because this
is an outdoor operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, we also need to be aware of
our timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, we're running into a
couple larger rocks with a couple larger
[SPEAKER_00]: holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the plant number precisely
measured, so we're not overplanting the
[SPEAKER_00]: density and ensure everything should be
hopefully allocated out very equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, as I mentioned, those rocks,
and here the surface, we've got some small
[SPEAKER_00]: pebbles and rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's perfectly fine, but going through,
sadly, running into some larger rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a little rock becomes a big rock,
well, you want to go through and typically
[SPEAKER_00]: bring in the larger equipment,
as we can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of what was thought to
be initially a small rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting to dig around it,
and it simply became larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of went sideways, which is never a
good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that rock doesn't budge, that's a
sign it might be even larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a field looking at some of the
history that there were some trees as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some additional roots in this
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a couple of those rocks
initially excavated out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but plenty of them in this particular
location there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of good about that practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows you to go through and see the
full soil profile as well, see what
[SPEAKER_00]: consistencies or inconsistencies may
exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we want to be mindful and try
to plan ahead as far as taking a soil test
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead of time, having all that equipment
ready to go, having the plant number,
[SPEAKER_00]: and not does everything always go to plan
with outdoor operations because there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of variables, not only in the weather,
but just in the conditions where you might
[SPEAKER_00]: dig a test hole in one area and everything
might go fine, might find a couple rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just dig those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here was one particular spot that
there was a large boulder found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working through, always nice to have
equipment and to be able to go through and
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure able to plant the cannabis clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you enjoyed that and look in the
video description.
Thanks for watching.
