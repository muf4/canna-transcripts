[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to investigate bulk
transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why I have this image of a
large tanker ship is this is moving a
[SPEAKER_00]: large quantity of materials, and we're
going to relate this to cells in biology
[SPEAKER_00]: and how do cells move large quantities of
material in and throughout their
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of this might sound familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bulk transport involves these vesicles,
allows small particles or groups of
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules to enter or leave the cell
without actually passing through the
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's containing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two mechanisms of bulk transport are
endocytosis and exocytosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So endome is taking something in,
exocytosis is something is leaving or
[SPEAKER_00]: exiting the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bulk transport is to transport large
particles and macromolecules across the
[SPEAKER_00]: plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our endocytosis has three different types,
and our exocytosis has one major type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So endocytosis is receptor-mediated,
penocytosis, and phagocytosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phagocytosis is cell eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we have the engulfing of
objects.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens in our immune system quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a neutrophil, which is a
white blood cell, chasing down and
[SPEAKER_00]: attacking this bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not eating any of the red blood
cells, these round, kind of round-looking
[SPEAKER_00]: cells here, because it's recognizing those
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's recognizing the small little bacteria
as an invader, and that's why it's chasing
[SPEAKER_00]: it down and ultimately engulfing it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would engulf it, bind to it,
engulf it, and then use lysosomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which contain digestive enzymes,
to help break it down to basically soluble
[SPEAKER_00]: debris that's not going to harm the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Penocytosis is the cell drinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endosomes drink extracellular fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's binding the substances, and it's
pinching off, and it's taking in typically
[SPEAKER_00]: ions with a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So penocytosis is kind of pinching here of
the membranes, and it's creating the
[SPEAKER_00]: vesicle, and it's collecting extracellular
fluid, typically ions, along with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Receptor-mediated endocytosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the most efficient form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's receptors on the actual exterior
surface of the cell membrane that bind to
[SPEAKER_00]: target molecules, specific target
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're coat vesicles, and they carry
ligands and receptors into the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's binding only to one very specific
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one very specific thing doesn't
matter what else is around the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's binding to, and that's
what it's collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's essentially what it's
accumulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this receptor-mediated is important,
because it's the cell's way of being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to bind to and collect only one specific
substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of just randomly grabbing things,
it's able to bind something very specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opposite process of all this is
exocytosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the reverse of endocytosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of taking something in,
it is removing of something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could be waste, something it has
an excess amount of, something that
[SPEAKER_00]: another cell may need.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So exocytosis, I don't want you always to
think of wastes, even though that's
[SPEAKER_00]: typically what it's associated with,
but it could be other valuable signals to
[SPEAKER_00]: get out into the extracellular fluid so
that cells around it can have that signal,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's one way of communication
between cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last part here, the thyroid hormone
synthesis process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you should be able to understand
the circled items here, and I circled them
[SPEAKER_00]: in blue here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these take you back to some other
video lectures, such as organelles with
[SPEAKER_00]: the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum,
our symporters, what those are about,
[SPEAKER_00]: endocytosis, what is that, and exocytosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of a good way to kind of
make sure you're able to kind of put all
[SPEAKER_00]: the pieces together from this series of
videos that I've created.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to go back and look at some
of those if you want to know some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: terms so that you're able now to start to
understand a little bit more of some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the processes that occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see here, just thyroid hormone
is very complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not understand all the parts,
but you should be able to tease out and
[SPEAKER_00]: understand some of the elements and
aspects that are going on here to help you
[SPEAKER_00]: begin to understand the larger process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
