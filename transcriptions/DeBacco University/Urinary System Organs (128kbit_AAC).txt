[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at urinary
system organs, the organs involved,
[SPEAKER_00]: tied in directly with the urinary system
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the basic organization of
the urinary system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our kidneys, which is an
important component of filtering the
[SPEAKER_00]: blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the urinary bladder,
and this provides temporary storage
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir for the urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have paired ureters here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why they're paired is because
they're transporting urine from the
[SPEAKER_00]: kidneys to the bladder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, we have the urethra,
which is transferring the urine from the
[SPEAKER_00]: bladder and having it excrete or go
outside of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, we also have our kidneys,
which is an important component of the
[SPEAKER_00]: urinary system because it produces the
urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has some main structures here called
the renal cortex, the renal medulla,
[SPEAKER_00]: the renal pelvis, and the nephrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a separate video on the nephrons,
and those are the actual functional units
[SPEAKER_00]: of the kidney.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have heard of kidney beans because
they have this kidney-like shape to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice that there's a lot of blood vessels
entering and capillaries going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important because this is the main
site of filtration for the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have two kidneys, even though you
only need one to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you often hear people donating a kidney
and they're still able to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because your body has kind of
redundancies and backups, just giving you
[SPEAKER_00]: an indication of how important the kidney
actually is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have two of them, in case one is to
fail, your body's still wants to have
[SPEAKER_00]: another that it can survive on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick facts about the kidneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They filter 200 liters of blood daily,
allowing toxins, metabolic waste,
[SPEAKER_00]: and excessive ions to leave the body in
the urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones, they're the site of the
actual filter that's taking things out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the blood and inserting them into the
urine so they can be excreted from the
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Approximately one-fourth or about 1,200
milliliters of systemic cardiac output
[SPEAKER_00]: flows to the kidneys each minute,
so it's a pretty intense amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you have so many capillaries
here and so many sites to allow this
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the blood in your body is filtered
about 60 times a day, which means about
[SPEAKER_00]: two and a half times every hour through
your kidneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's important for your body to
help eliminate those toxins that are
[SPEAKER_00]: building up and store them in the urine so
they can be excreted from the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: The urine itself, the formation of that,
is it's refilting actually the plasmas of
[SPEAKER_00]: the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a plasma is the majority, it's 55%.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is again occurring about 60 times a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's actually being filtered.
[SPEAKER_00]: The filtrate contains all plasma
components except protein, and it loses
[SPEAKER_00]: water, nutrients, and excessive ions to
become urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urine contains metabolic waste that are
unneeded substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now based on the color of the urine can
determine the degree of hydration or
[SPEAKER_00]: dehydration of an individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're looking at more of that darker
yellow color, it'd be more dehydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at that lighter yellow it's almost
clear color would be a hydrated person.
[SPEAKER_00]: The color of the urine is determined
mostly by the breakdown of products of the
[SPEAKER_00]: red blood cell destruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heme of hemoglobin is converted by the
liver into water-soluble forms that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: excreted into bile and indirectly into the
urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the yellow pigment of urine is
urochrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now urine contains some ammonia,
which is very toxic, but as we learned in
[SPEAKER_00]: another video, that their also body
converts it to urea, a less toxic form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the body would rather excrete the
urine in the form of, the nitrogen form is
[SPEAKER_00]: urea in the urine rather than ammonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have high amounts of ammonia it
will have a strong odor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's also other things,
phosphate, chloride, magnesium,
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium, and so on and so forth,
ions as part of the urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the vast majority of urine is
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the bladder, it's the urinary
bladder, collects urine from both ureters
[SPEAKER_00]: and from the kidneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bladder is largely retroperitoneal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means it can hold up about 500 to
600 milliliters of urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this retroperitoneal allows it to be
able to change sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can grow larger as more urine is
being accumulated and you have the urge to
[SPEAKER_00]: pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll go through the sphincter
muscles and release the urine and excrete
[SPEAKER_00]: that from the body, eliminating also waste
products from the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is again how your body is able to
filter the blood, concentrate toxins,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it'll limit them from the body to
avoid an excessive buildup which can
[SPEAKER_00]: threaten the life of the individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
