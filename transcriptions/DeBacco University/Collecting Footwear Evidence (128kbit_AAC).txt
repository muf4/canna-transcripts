[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm going to go over collecting
footwear evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe a little bit obvious in the
example that I've shown here in sand and
[SPEAKER_00]: snow, it is possible to collect footwear
in less ideal conditions if you follow
[SPEAKER_00]: proper procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, when we're looking at
footwear evidence, it's always left no
[SPEAKER_00]: matter if it can be found or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to keep that in mind and
something to always be on the lookout for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's physical contact between the
footwear and the visible surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: it leaves transfers class and also
potentially individual characteristics and
[SPEAKER_00]: both can be used for identification of
possible suspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this footwear is class evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind class characteristics can be
used to eliminate suspect shoe or suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: a shoe could have made the impression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compare the sizes and patterns of the
prints from the suspect to the shoe that
[SPEAKER_00]: is recovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just a basic size can help
classify or potentially eliminate if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a list of suspects that could have
been present at the crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we talked about individual
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about shoes,
those are generally class characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now when we're looking at these
individual characteristics, these are used
[SPEAKER_00]: to identify the exact shoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, keep in mind that these can
change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're able to capture the shoe very
closely to when the crime may have
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred, that's going to give you the
strongest matching possibility for these
[SPEAKER_00]: individual characteristics, which can
include small cracks or small tears or
[SPEAKER_00]: small imperfections found in the tread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now information application.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're linking the suspect or victim to the
scenes or it could link to crime scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Location of the prints can lead to more
evidence to be found or investigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can refute alibis or a defense by an
accused person proposing to show that he
[SPEAKER_00]: or she could not have committed the crime
in question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could help strengthen the fact that
they could be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see here a couple kind of
comparisons of impressions found at the
[SPEAKER_00]: crime scene, test footwear impressions,
photo of the outsoles and photo of the
[SPEAKER_00]: suspect's footwear to see how these may or
may not match up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now suspect's footwear, all footwear a
suspect owns should be seized for
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoes are needed to make test impressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be very important for trying to
identify those individual characteristics
[SPEAKER_00]: because you want to capture them as soon
or as quick as you can between when the
[SPEAKER_00]: crime was committed and when you can get
your hand on those evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're looking at footwear,
as I said, it will be found everywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just because you find a footwear
impression doesn't mean that it is
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically from the suspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to eliminate those that are
innocent that were also present at the
[SPEAKER_00]: crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it includes footwear worn by police
officers, medical personnel should be
[SPEAKER_00]: accounted for and considered for
impressions left at the crime scene
[SPEAKER_00]: because these are going to be footprints
you're going to want to eliminate from the
[SPEAKER_00]: investigation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at those known footwear
impressions, an examiner will make
[SPEAKER_00]: impressions of known footwear and compare
them to the suspect's footwear impressions
[SPEAKER_00]: to ensure matching samples are highly
detailed and have individual
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics of the actual souls
because this will really help increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: odds of a positive identification or a
high correlation of a match to be found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now footwear evidence collection,
detection and recovery of footwear
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence from a scene of a crime is
important because different shoes will
[SPEAKER_00]: leave behind prints of various sizes and
also patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is looking here from the area kind
of circled and highlighted to allow for
[SPEAKER_00]: further investigation of those particular
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, looking at could be dirt,
could be soil, could be blood,
[SPEAKER_00]: could be all sorts of other potential
fluids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be transferred such as paint,
but it's always important to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: quality picture with a ruler in that image
and any other information you can provide
[SPEAKER_00]: to help you further identify that print or
use it as part of telling the story of the
[SPEAKER_00]: crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have control over the crime
scene is very important for many reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really to prevent destruction of evidence
and limit the amount of unrelated prints
[SPEAKER_00]: made as amongst other kind of pieces of
evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's very important to
establish control of that crime scene very
[SPEAKER_00]: early on because it will just help
solidify the information that you find
[SPEAKER_00]: with having you to reduce the time spent
culling out or eliminating certain
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence that's found that is not part of
the actual crime scene, but was found or
[SPEAKER_00]: placed in after the fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So locating and recovering footwear,
those particularly impressions that I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, it's critical that proper
techniques be used to locate, document and
[SPEAKER_00]: recover the footwear's evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full and partial prints must be recovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just because you didn't find a full
print, it's not necessarily a bad piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even partial prints can be utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this only can happen if the scene is
secured and you're allowed to go in and
[SPEAKER_00]: collect the evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The documentation of those prints or
footprints locations should be documented
[SPEAKER_00]: and photographed, enhancing evidence as
necessary where it may be needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some prints can be visualized by darkening
the room and using a bright light at a low
[SPEAKER_00]: angle to try to get that kind of shadow
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really important here as we kind of see in
the snow and the mud, we have a deeper
[SPEAKER_00]: print kind of reducing the angle that that
light may come in can really help bring
[SPEAKER_00]: out some of the shadows and really help
intensify that print on a photographic
[SPEAKER_00]: image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you're going through and
photographing, quality photographs is
[SPEAKER_00]: important and should be taken on the
impressions if they cannot be transported.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times it might be in place,
but taking good quality photographs are
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those photos can be taken for later
comparison with suspect footwear,
[SPEAKER_00]: therefore they must be very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scale should be used to gauge the size of
the footprint because that can help act as
[SPEAKER_00]: potential class evidence as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's how to kind of properly take a
photograph technique of a footwear print.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see kind of an alternate light
source kind of going straight vertically
[SPEAKER_00]: down in the potential print.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything marked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The camera on a tripod to allow a very
steady photograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: The photographer wearing very protective
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also covering the soles of their shoes to
eliminate any confounding footprints to be
[SPEAKER_00]: made that would only have to later be
eliminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, we're covering the footprints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Object footprints should be removed if
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're on paper or glass,
since this often is not an option,
[SPEAKER_00]: examination in those photographs with a
rule for size and comparison do become
[SPEAKER_00]: very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Producing known impressions of shoes being
examined and comparing crime scene
[SPEAKER_00]: impressions with the footwear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could be, as I said, on a hard
surface here or it could be on a very soft
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to kind of recover those
footprints and act as comparison can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: very critical piece of evidence.
