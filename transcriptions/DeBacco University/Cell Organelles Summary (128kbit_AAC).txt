[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a very quick summary
of the cell organelles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of give you a quick rundown of
some of the components found in cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to look in the description
for the slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can print those out or look at them
independently or simply pause the video if
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at kind of what's going on in
the cell, this is just kind of a rendition
[SPEAKER_00]: of some of the components.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to point out is kind of this
phospholipid bilayer being important,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of that separation factor between the
interior component of the cell and the
[SPEAKER_00]: exterior component.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind while this does wrap around
the entire cell, these large kind of globs
[SPEAKER_00]: here are cell membrane proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some pass all the way through,
some located only on the surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: some located only on the interior.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a couple of little things that you
may not recognize on a quick look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the other organelles like the
mitochondria, the rough and smooth ER,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Golgi might be more recognizable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that quick general summary,
I promised I would provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some microvilli, which really
aren't shown too much in any of these
[SPEAKER_00]: slideshows, but they're kind of that
extensive folding of the cell membrane
[SPEAKER_00]: allow for cells to have a great absorption
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really help increase the surface area
for absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: That membrane, that phospholipid bilayer
that I mentioned, acts as a barrier
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing cells to regulate what comes in
and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Centrioles are bundles of microtubules,
and they're very important for cell
[SPEAKER_00]: division, the mitosis process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lysosomes, peroxisomes, for example,
are vesicles that have a bilayer and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're very important to contain enzymes
for the breakdown process, helping things
[SPEAKER_00]: secreted by the cell potentially to digest
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mitochondria, a double-walled
organelle, produces most of the cell's
[SPEAKER_00]: ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's adenosine triphosphate, and that's
the energy currency of the cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: despite many people saying it's just
simply the powerhouse of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have ribosomes, and they're a
specialized protein that translates
[SPEAKER_00]: messenger RNA into polypeptides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're responsible for the synthesis or
creation of proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rough and smooth ER, endoplasmic
reticulums, are responsible, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: those rough, contain those ribosomes to
produce proteins, and those smooth ER are
[SPEAKER_00]: more responsible for synthesizing fatty
acids and lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golgi apparatus modifies and packages
proteins, especially those that are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be excreted out of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microtubules and microfilaments,
they're part of the cell cytoskeleton,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're important for transportation
within the cell, also important for the
[SPEAKER_00]: mitosis process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nucleus, and inside that the
nucleolus, those are vital components of
[SPEAKER_00]: containing the main DNA of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that nucleolus contains a lot of
the RNA, which is the ribosomal RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a quick run-through so you
can kind of make sure to understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: basic characteristics and functions of
various cell organelles.
