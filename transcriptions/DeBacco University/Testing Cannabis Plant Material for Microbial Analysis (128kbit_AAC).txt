[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over some of the specifics
[SPEAKER_00]: of looking at microbial analysis of
cannabis plant material, which is an
[SPEAKER_00]: important test to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, you're going to learn about the
details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into testing cannabis
plant material for microbial analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, here is a research article
where some of the information was pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a summary here, but you can go
through and research this yourself if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at learning a little bit
more about the details that were presented
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to use this study to focus on
the microbes, but in addition,
[SPEAKER_00]: they also talk about heavy metals and
pesticides, other important tests that are
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned on other videos on this channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, cannabis diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least 88 fungal species cause
disease in cannabis, as do eight
[SPEAKER_00]: pathovarieties of plant pathogenic
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of diseases that cannabis
plants can acquire.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most threatening disease of flowering
tops are caused by the Inquetitis fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: botrytis scenario, typically referred to
as gray mold, as we can see here,
[SPEAKER_00]: botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have alternaria that can cause
issues with the plants that tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce kind of brown, looks like little
brown circles, starts using the lower
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves can work its way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are just two macroscopic
examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, there's also fungal species
that can be microscopically involved that
[SPEAKER_00]: can still cause contamination and bad end
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pathogenic threat to humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, phytopathogens cannot infect humans
except perhaps immunocompromised
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some different types of
pathogens that may not be of direct
[SPEAKER_00]: infection to humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's opportunistic infections
by alternaria, as we can see here as a
[SPEAKER_00]: microscopic view.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been reported in patients
receiving chemotherapy, recent organ
[SPEAKER_00]: transplants, patients as well as people
with AIDS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also airborne canidia, which are basically
spores of scenario and alternaria,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause mold allergies and asthma,
particularly in greenhouse workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't think that you're completely
immune just because that pathogen may not
[SPEAKER_00]: be a direct human infection agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can cause other potential symptoms as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So indoor and outdoor problem when we're
looking at these pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just an indoor grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just an outdoor grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aspergillus and penicillium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Predominant indoors and cladosporium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Predominant outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing in an indoor or
outdoor location, you may have different
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes that you'd be of greater concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just because you're growing in one
environment versus another does not mean
[SPEAKER_00]: your canvas is completely immune to the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cladosporium may be an emerging problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fungus also infest hemp mills as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even not growing the crop, even storing
the crop can be an area where these
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes can get hold and start to
proliferate.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 1% of cannabis supplies received in
Harborside Medical Cannabis Dispensary in
[SPEAKER_00]: Oakland, California were returned or
basically rejected to vendors because
[SPEAKER_00]: unacceptable levels of aspergillium
contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of what it looks like on a
kind of zoomed in level.
[SPEAKER_00]: What really looks like a zoomed in level
is canidia, these little spores that break
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this looks like it grows on a plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't look like this on the actual
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might be hard to see without proper
microscope technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 1% of the supplies received were
rejected because of just this one
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a real problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the American Herbal Pharmacopeia are
eight HP protocols here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have theirs listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have based on tests of commodity for
food products issued by the EPA and Food
[SPEAKER_00]: and Drug Administration as well as assays
for cannabis used in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: For orally consumed cannabis, the HP
recommends four tests, total yeast and
[SPEAKER_00]: mold counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total chloroforms, E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli, and salmonella testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, they recommend immunochemical
methods screened for aflatoxins as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: For production to be inhaled, the
stringent tests were recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, total yeast, total aerobic counts,
biotolerant and gram-negative bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli, salmonella, and aflatoxin assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: The HP proposed some specific limits in
CFU, which is California units per gram
[SPEAKER_00]: counts, but emphasized that these values
do not represent the past fail criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather, they are recommended levels when
plants are cultivated and harvested under
[SPEAKER_00]: normal circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is important to know your local
regulations in the sense of what they
[SPEAKER_00]: expect you to test, what levels do they
set at the past fail line.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just providing one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at Colorado as another example
here in 2015, Colorado did update their
[SPEAKER_00]: testing regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their total yeast or salmonella values
limited here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this does not mean it contains no
salmonella.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salmonella are no yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just set the limit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be under this theoretical
limit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's recommendations to test for
the three species of aspergillus here,
[SPEAKER_00]: although it was never implemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another thing you need to look
at is what's proposed, what's implemented,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what is required, and realize that
these may change from year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to stay current with whatever
testing is required by the state or agency
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, species detection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, with aspergillus,
it's a large genus with 250 species,
[SPEAKER_00]: and separating three specific species from
the others is not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to the challenges associated with
species-specific detection, Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: changed their testing requirements again
in 2016 after they had just updated them
[SPEAKER_00]: to a 10,000 CFU gram total yeast and mold
test, but left in place the single CFU
[SPEAKER_00]: testing for E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli and salmonella.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, important as a consumer also to
be aware of the testing, testing changes
[SPEAKER_00]: that may occur, and going back and looking
at the actual analytical report to be that
[SPEAKER_00]: informed consumer is advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, looking at the CFU's coliform units,
what they basically do is they grow on a
[SPEAKER_00]: plate, and we can see here they have a
count, and they base that count per gram
[SPEAKER_00]: to determine whether or not it is above or
below that set threshold level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we're also looking at PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is polymerase chain reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very specific test here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very precise test.
[SPEAKER_00]: To accelerate the testing turnaround time,
some labs are now using what's called
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative polymerase chain reaction,
or QPCR assays, which detects DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences in cannabis samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drawback of this method is that it's
indifferent whether the material is living
[SPEAKER_00]: or non-living DNA, just testing DNA if
it's present or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: To accommodate this, an enrichment step is
performed where the cannabis samples are
[SPEAKER_00]: incubated overnight in TBS broth,
which is just a nutrient broth,
[SPEAKER_00]: prior to the PCR detection being run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overnight growth ensures that only living
organisms are measured, but raises
[SPEAKER_00]: questions of the overall preferential
cultural conditions for broader total
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast and mold tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: To address this conundrum, this kind of
challenge of like caught in between,
[SPEAKER_00]: some labs perform the PCR test on total
yeast and molds, and a positive result are
[SPEAKER_00]: confirmed with an additional test
extracted 24 hours later to ensure the
[SPEAKER_00]: signal from the pre-incubated test was,
in fact, from live organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, testing labs are trying to
figure this out so that they're not giving
[SPEAKER_00]: false results, not giving false positives
or false negatives, providing quality
[SPEAKER_00]: results to consumers so you can trust the
test results that you're able to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, just figured I shouldn't
mention gamma radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about removing contaminants,
microbial contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using gamma radiation has been used to
basically radiate microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminations.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this does remain controversial,
and it may destroy terpenes and does not
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Important note there, mycotoxins are
unaffected by gamma radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a study that was done that
looked at 10,000 grades in four cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: for THC and CBD dominant cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Levels of total THC and or CBD were not
altered by radiation treatments in any of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cultivars tested compared to controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did notice some degradation of
terpenes as kind of presented here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they compared those reductions to
similar decreases arising from short-term
[SPEAKER_00]: storage in a paper bag as part of their
general method of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while there was decreases compared to
the known storage conditions, they may not
[SPEAKER_00]: have been as bad as once thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may just be a normal degradation
during the protocol of testing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just another option, even though
controversial, figured I would mention it
[SPEAKER_00]: just to keep you an informed consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching.
I'll see you next time.
