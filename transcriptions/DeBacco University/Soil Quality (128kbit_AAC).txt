[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to go over soil quality,
and the take home quote here is,
[SPEAKER_00]: treat your soil well, and it will return
the favor to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you want to be careful and mindful of
your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to mess it up, and ideally
the crops you get off it will be more than
[SPEAKER_00]: bountiful for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the obvious question is just what is
soil quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a combination of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often referred to as soil health,
but really more properly called soil
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the soil health is kind of the
physical properties of your soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: the chemical properties, and the
biological properties, and how they all
[SPEAKER_00]: interact and overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: That little portion right here in the
middle would be your soil health,
[SPEAKER_00]: or soil qualities, we're going to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first off, what is soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, soil is, or should be, about 50%
mineral, 25% air, and 25% water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, whether you have clay, or silty clay,
or silt loom, or silt or sandy loom,
[SPEAKER_00]: depends on the percent clay, the percent
silt, and the percent sand that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice the percent clay has a large
bearing on what type of soil it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clay is very small particles, and they
influence the properties of soil quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, good for growing conditions,
as I said here, is the 50-25-25 split.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compacted soil, though, you'll notice a
greater percentage of the solid,
[SPEAKER_00]: and poorly drained soil has more water,
and also that same percentage solid,
[SPEAKER_00]: but more percentage of water, and that's
how your water log, your air percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, these are some conditions you may have
experienced, or have fields that have
[SPEAKER_00]: this, but ideally you're trying to shoot
for that 50-25 25-25 split.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get the soil testory back,
and they say, silty loom, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: this gives you an idea in this triangle of
what percentage clay, silt, and sand that
[SPEAKER_00]: you do have in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Balance is the key, regardless of what
soil you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the key part here is to be balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different things going
on, not as simple as just one kind of leg
[SPEAKER_00]: here of the lever.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be multiple things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, looking at the results you get back
from the lab, it's important to realize
[SPEAKER_00]: what's high values and what are low
values, and the goal is to have a balanced
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you want to bring the low values up
without adding even greater amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients to the high values, and it's a
difficult balancing act, and there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: give and take within everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, quality, this gives you an idea of the
complexities, the Moulter's chart,
[SPEAKER_00]: of what's an antagonism or synergistic
with certain nutrients, and how you affect
[SPEAKER_00]: one, and how it affects all the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to get very complex,
can be very hard to understand,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least initially, there's some
micronutrients in here, there's some major
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and how they all interact,
but as I showed in the last one,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's that balancing act that you're trying
to maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to just look at one and
just raise one.
[SPEAKER_00]: By increasing one, you're also going to
potentially affect some others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's just important to keep that in
mind, and when in doubt, start on the low
[SPEAKER_00]: end, because you can always add more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, more is not better.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, you want to start on the low
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excessive amounts of nutrients can
restrict plant growth, negatively impact
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment, and basically cause you
unnecessary expenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a deficiency range here,
and a critical range in that sufficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here's your yields are increasing,
and at a certain point, that sufficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: range, it doesn't change.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep adding nutrients at this
point, you get to this toxic range,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could actually have a reduction in
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, your goal is to reach that critical
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's at the point what we call
no-fertilizer response is likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, up to this point, you keep adding
fertilizer, your percent yield keeps going
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a certain point, and this
would be the exact point here,
[SPEAKER_00]: where adding more fertilizer does not give
you more yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just increases your cost, and your
time, and your investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you want to try to be as close to here
as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you overshoot a little bit,
that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you undershoot a little bit,
that can be okay too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you add some fertilizer, you can bring
it back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part is to know when you're close
or approaching that critical level,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you go too high, it could
really cause some issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what do I add to my soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's liquid versions of some nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's wetable powders.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's granular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one do I choose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they all have pros and cons to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pro is that it's really easy to
measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, we'll run through an injector
easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see, talk about drip irrigation and
fertilizer injectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the downfall of liquids is that
they shouldn't freeze at any point in
[SPEAKER_00]: their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, storage of them could be an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take up large volumes, two and a half
gallons, five gallon storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often, there's a stabilizer in them
that could settle over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something if you're saving a year
to a year, a lot of times you'll see a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a layer develop at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to try to shake them and stir
them mid-winter, just to go through so
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not settling out, so you don't
lose that stabilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, over time, it has a tendency to
drop out of solution, and that could be an
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wetable powders, they don't settle over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small volume for storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the cons is they can be messy and hard
to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often require pre-mixing before tank
mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like making the chocolate milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should put it in the container here,
shake it up before you add it to the glass
[SPEAKER_00]: here, so it can be a little bit harder to
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the advantage is they store small,
and they don't settle over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to granular.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are easily broadcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: No special equipment needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally, you can take a glove and a pail
and go and spread them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can't be fed through an
irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertility irrigation through drip
irrigation is not possible with granular.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different size granular.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some larger particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some smaller particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it like applying sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tend to be cheaper and bought in larger
quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're looking at soil health or soil
quality, pH should be your number one
[SPEAKER_00]: concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically Connecticut, our soil is acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have two types of lime,
so all lime is not treated the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not assume, though, lime needs to be
added every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some fields that do need to be
limed every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are every other year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are every fifth year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some you fertilize once with lime,
and you're kind of done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I caution you about using wood ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can drastically increase your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great at raising your pH,
but it can add it to become too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And too high is just as bad as too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're shooting for just slightly acidic,
6.8 for most crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.5 is our goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most native soils, we can be hovering
around five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cases a little bit lower,
some cases a little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're shooting for around that neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding wood ash, I've seen soil
approaching 10, which causes all sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: other issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're adjusting our pH using lime,
the two types are dolomitic, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: commonly called agricultural lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is high in magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 12% magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's calcitic or garden lime,
and this is a lower magnesium content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your magnesium is already high,
you could be looking at more of a calcitic
[SPEAKER_00]: or a garden lime to be adding to your
particular soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: NPK, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen, I put in parentheses here,
we determine that with a nitrogen nitrate
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a little difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Special test to kind of go through and
follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do nitrate tests when I do to get a true
analysis of your soil nitrate levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus, we want to caution,
it's a freshwater contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you over-add phosphorus, yes,
people say it's important for roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting them growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you over-add phosphorus,
it can contaminate fresh groundwater,
[SPEAKER_00]: wells, and area ponds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium K is commonly needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be pulled out of soil pretty
readily by some crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can show up as a deficiency in some
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other macronutrients, calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lime does contain calcium, but for the
most part, it's not really
[SPEAKER_00]: plant-available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like in the raw form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a silvery look to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnesium that I talked about can be an
issue with tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epsom salts is great for that,
for the magnesium, or dolomitic lime if
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil is low in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, epsom salts can give you some
sulfur, which may be more of a concern due
[SPEAKER_00]: to lack of acid rain we're receiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back, we had a lot of acid rain coming
from some of the power plants out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They since have cleaned up their stacks as
we get those less sulfuric acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the acid rain was sulfuric acid
that was raining down, and some fields
[SPEAKER_00]: were getting, quote, free sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we're getting not as much acid
rain, we're not getting that free sulfur
[SPEAKER_00]: we kind of took for granted in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in certain instances, you may see low
sulfur not necessarily on the large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micronutrients are also important not to
over-add.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people get hung up in the
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your irons, your manganese, your borons,
your coppers, your zincs, your chlorides,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really focus on these.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you get your pH straightened out and
your macros straightened out, then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: move to these.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're typically better determined by a
test of the leaves, not necessarily a
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, and overall they should not be your
focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rarely is this a problem on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen growers over-add these and get
into issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of use the association of
micronutrients, consider them to be like a
[SPEAKER_00]: spice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can take a perfectly good steak and
over-spice it, it will taste horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take a micronutrient and over-add
it, and it can really cause havoc on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sub-micronutrients, molybdenum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Odds are very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some growers are asking,
should I test for molybdenum?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a small amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's in a fertilizer, it typically
comes with a warning, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe harmful to ruminant animals for
foraging grass where applications have
[SPEAKER_00]: been made.
[SPEAKER_00]: This I found online here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the link on the description to look
into their sources there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it would look like,
but really it mimics a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our area, I have never seen this really
be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbiology, also getting a lot of talk,
driven by the hobbyist gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stick to some of the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some supporting evidence,
more than just the manufacturer's
[SPEAKER_00]: brochures.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of advertising saying this
is the best micronutrient if you add this,
[SPEAKER_00]: guaranteed to get bigger crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure your pH and your
macronutrients are straightened out before
[SPEAKER_00]: you start moving to microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some examples of some I've heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial bacteria, Actinidae,
Azos, Companion.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tend to have a little bit more
supporting evidence than some other ones
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard about.
[SPEAKER_00]: These might be worth an initial look if
you feel everything else is straightened
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: For fungi, Root Shield, and mycorrhizae,
Root Shield is Root Shield Plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycorrhizae is being found in potting
mixes too.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can be some good beneficial fungi to
look at and target.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, earthworms can't be overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have many benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be kind to them and you'll get their free
castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to go out and buy any.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just work their way through the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're happy, you'll be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coffee grounds can be a great way to
encourage the initial population.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually even grow them over the
winter in a slightly heated basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at something to do over
the winter and want to get a head start
[SPEAKER_00]: and get in some earthworms for the area
you plan on growing in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tillage, disturbing the soil as little as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Till with a purpose, I always say.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different types of tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's zone, there's chisel plow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to maintain species to stay for a
city with the soil and the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep living roots in your soil and keep
the soil covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned this in a couple other videos
with cover crops and weed management.
[SPEAKER_00]: But tillage, you want to remember that you
are disturbing the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be good if you have a purpose,
but to just keep going through and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: eating up the soil can have negative
effects over the long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to maintain high quality, that species
diversity in soil and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep living roots all year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the soil covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be a non-invasive way called a
broad fork.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a very small area,
basically jab this in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you put it in the ground,
you'll rock it back and you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking the soil to get some aeration in
without really turning or flipping the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tissue testing, turnaround time is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do want to go through and do tissue
testing to determine your plant health,
[SPEAKER_00]: increased cost, reduced time between
sampling result is worth the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone will turn the results back in
under a week and you have to pay a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more, that's worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because tissue testing, you're typically
looking at a quick result to fix a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a tomato leaf and a bean leaf
here exhibiting some of these symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is potassium in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're able to go through and have that be
an issue, correct that with some liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you can see you're saving your
crop, so turnaround time is important for
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf analysis if you do want to go
this route.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, start with the pH, looking at that
and your macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get those in line, a lot of other
things will come together, but there are
[SPEAKER_00]: other options.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part is treat your soil well and
it will treat you well also.
Thank you.
