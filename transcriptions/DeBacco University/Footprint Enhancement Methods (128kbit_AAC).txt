[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at footprint
enhancement and we see a great example of
[SPEAKER_00]: that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have sequential chemical enhancement of
footwear impressions in blood on white
[SPEAKER_00]: polyester using luminol, neahydrin,
and acid black 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of gives you an idea of how
we can enhance or change that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: footprint to be able to show certain
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, however, when we're looking at
enhancement in general, one word of
[SPEAKER_00]: caution is that we want to be careful with
any enhancement methods that we might be
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these may damage the original
prints, which can lead to destruction of
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence and possible disqualification
from being used in court.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have an original photograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have an enhanced one at a certain
point of where is the line of over
[SPEAKER_00]: enhancing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just word of caution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only use this if you need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use this as a default method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So post initial photography methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a footprint is made in blood,
color change and reagents can help
[SPEAKER_00]: visualize the prints.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can be physical methods such as
latent powder, lifting impressions or
[SPEAKER_00]: impressions on paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these are found in easy to carry
kits to a crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have dusting for footprints.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like we would dust for
fingerprints, the same can be applied to
[SPEAKER_00]: footprints and you can use the same
powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even fingerprint powder can be visualized
prints using the same basic procedures as
[SPEAKER_00]: you would for fingerprints lifted with
adhesive or gelatin and photographed then
[SPEAKER_00]: to be included as evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something that may initially be really
hard to see, you can kind of see it sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of kind of with that with that adding of
fingerprint powder, it becomes much
[SPEAKER_00]: clearer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have something called
electrostatic lifting, which is an
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive technique to recover
impressions typically used on hard
[SPEAKER_00]: surfaces such as tile or wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a charge used to lift dry
materials from a surface to a black film.
[SPEAKER_00]: This lift will provide more contrast and
is non-destructive and then it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: photographed and entered evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: As evidence, placards or markers are used
to document locations of impressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If possible, remove and transport those
impressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those electrostatic dust printing devices
operate by charging a plastic film placed
[SPEAKER_00]: over a dust pan, which creates
electrostatic adhesions into a film
[SPEAKER_00]: surface showing the print.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now casting of prints.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of simple, requires a little
bit of a kind of carrying of this bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: material, but it can pick up really,
it can pick up detail very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The material is very durable, this
casting, and it can be cast after it's
[SPEAKER_00]: photographed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should always take photographs
first, then make a cast and if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: take photographs after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically this casting material is kind of
a basis of some sort of dental stone
[SPEAKER_00]: because it allows a really strong
structure to be made, but allows also the
[SPEAKER_00]: retaining of certain details.
[SPEAKER_00]: And products can be sprayed with colorized
wax to aid in highlighting those prints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now impression enhancements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So poor impressions can sometimes are made
and may have to be enhanced by the
[SPEAKER_00]: following means.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially it might be really hard to
see the details, so you can offer some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these enhancements, particularly for the
purpose of photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oblique ultraviolet infrared or other
special methods can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see kind of a snow print simply
using a coloration to create a greater
[SPEAKER_00]: contrast can really help provide an
exposure to some of those details that can
[SPEAKER_00]: be more easily photographed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now chemical enhancement methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at chemical enhancement reagents
such as crystal violet, luminol,
[SPEAKER_00]: and hydrine may also be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw this on the title slide,
the difference you can get with these
[SPEAKER_00]: certain chemical enhancement methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also have digital enhancement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Software such as Photoshop can be used to
enhance impressions, but remember there is
[SPEAKER_00]: a fine line between overdoing the
enhancement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a woman in the woods,
we see kind of a left and a right,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see that kind of enhancement of color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see probably a Photoshop that's
gone a little too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep in mind that digital
enhancement methods should only be used if
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely necessary and kind of as a last
resort because it could eliminate them
[SPEAKER_00]: from being included as evidence in a court
setting.
