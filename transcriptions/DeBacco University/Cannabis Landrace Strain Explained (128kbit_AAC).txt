[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another DeBaco University
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video we're going to explore
cannabis land race strains and we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to explain them, kind of what they are and
define them to provide you with some
[SPEAKER_00]: information as well as a little history
into cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically you may have heard of land
race strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that actually term mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn about that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting off land race is simply kind
of a way of saying an original strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a land race marijuana strain is
considered to be one of the original
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that can date back to the 1960s
and even earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: These land race strains typically carry
the name of the geographic location that
[SPEAKER_00]: they were thought to originate from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a couple listed right here again
depending what region of the world these
[SPEAKER_00]: original strains they kind of get that
geographic kind of name associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: them to give an idea of where they may
have started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now land race strain did have some
isolation so Sativa land race strains
[SPEAKER_00]: moved all across the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were ones that were pretty mobile to
be tolerant of a lot of conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where Indica land races were isolated to
the arid mountainous regions typically
[SPEAKER_00]: found around Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't until the 1970s where these
strains were actually bred together to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of create some hybrids and kind of
causes a little bit of confusion as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So identifying or tracing these back much
further than the 1960s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the breeding process just in general
the breeding and selecting process was
[SPEAKER_00]: able to slowly remove unwanted
characteristics while retaining the
[SPEAKER_00]: desired traits to be expressed more
consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is through that again that multiple
traveling throughout the world multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: grows and ultimately a selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Key traits were bred for that are still in
focus of many growers today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So resistance to disease is a very
important one and overall plant production
[SPEAKER_00]: are kind of the two main ones that
breeders are still trying to always work
[SPEAKER_00]: on and refine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has resulted in majority of the
current plants being a mixture of the
[SPEAKER_00]: original land race strains to create
hybrids as I mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now land races of cannabis are kind of
like the heirlooms of cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense that from the 1960s are not grown on
really a large scale today those original
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: However there are some purists that kind
of keep the strains alive in the current
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic pool within the plant population.
[SPEAKER_00]: I relate this to kind of like maybe very
familiar with like heirloom tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These particular tomatoes may not yield
the best or have certain qualities that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be advantageous but also some
drawbacks but kind of to preserve that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of original strains original genetics
they are still continued to be grown this
[SPEAKER_00]: day for incorporation to hybrids or grown
to the final end product themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just some common land race strains
related to marijuana as I mentioned a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch that were listed earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just a few random examples here
of the many options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this provided you with a
little bit of background on what a land
[SPEAKER_00]: race strain is regarding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And give you just a little bit of that
background so now when you hear the term
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a better understanding.
