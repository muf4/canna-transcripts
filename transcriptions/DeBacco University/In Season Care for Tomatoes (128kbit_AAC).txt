[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over some of
the basic in-season care for your tomatoes
[SPEAKER_00]: to ideally get them to turn from green
color to a nice harvestable red that your
[SPEAKER_00]: customers will like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in-season care for tomatoes,
we want to think about irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is usually a high-value crop,
so typically it warrants irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is advised, I usually recommend drip
irrigation because it's simple to set up,
[SPEAKER_00]: able to handle very long and extensive
rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just watch when you're pounding in stakes
that you do not damage the lines when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're setting up your rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use overhead irrigation,
but this is usually recommended as a quick
[SPEAKER_00]: fix and not a permanent solution because
of the wetting of the leaves and the
[SPEAKER_00]: increased chance for certain diseases to
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be using weed block to suppress
the weeds on your tomato rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many options, but in-row
protection may help reduce soil splash
[SPEAKER_00]: that we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep those tomatoes nice and well
positioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the two drip lines located
here under the plastic, eliminating the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount that's lost to evaporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: For ultimate protection though,
you might want to be considering
[SPEAKER_00]: in-between row protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here, we're noticing that where the
harvesters and caretakers are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: walking, there's also some fabric laid
down to help reduce weed pressure there
[SPEAKER_00]: and also eliminate potential for soil
splash.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a staking and weaving system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see some stakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tie your tomatoes up directly to
those or weave those right in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basket weaving is advised for field to
help support the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be set up shortly after
transplant to prevent wind damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in this caterpillar tunnel situation
here, we want to be mindful of wind that's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming through here, which is good for air
circulation, but we don't want to damage
[SPEAKER_00]: our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last one, we're pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has their own method,
so it can be personal preference,
[SPEAKER_00]: but typically the two-liter system is
preferred and it has minimal side shoots,
[SPEAKER_00]: so minimum suppers that come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In high tunnels, some people will use
clips to help support the tomato crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: others will kind of wrap the tomatoes
around that string there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, personal preference and exactly
how you take care of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part is in some way to be
supporting them and pruning them for
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum yield.
Thank you.
