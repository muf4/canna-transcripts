[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to talk about the
basics of proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the reason why I don't have a static
image here, but one that is rotating,
[SPEAKER_00]: is three-dimensional shape is very
important to the functions of proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we'll see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's important to be able to
view this protein from all sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So proteins are composed of amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's different subunits that are
linked together that will ultimately form
[SPEAKER_00]: the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's 20 common amino acids in this
sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's 22 genetically encoded amino
acids, but 20 are the common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking a little bit in more detail to
this basic components of an amino acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have this basic structure here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is that R group, which is the
variant group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, again, what makes each amino
acid unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the amino group, the hydrogen
group, and our carboxyl group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the amino acid gets its name from the
amino group, the amino, hydrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: and carboxyl group.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are common in standard across all
amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes them different is this R group
that provides them with a different
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and also a different function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the amino acids here,
this is a list of 21 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see them kind of organized
based on some of their properties here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of those properties that
an amino acid may have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they could have a positive side
chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could have a negative side chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be amino acids with polar
uncharged side chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see those organized here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Special cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then amino acids with hydrophobic side
chains here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're each given a name,
a three-letter kind of code, and then a
[SPEAKER_00]: single-letter code.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in eukaryotes, there's only 21 amino
acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 20 of those are in the standard
genetic code.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus there's one other one there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to focus really mainly on
those 20 there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans can only synthesize 12,
though, of these amino acids, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: nine are considered essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they must be consumed in the diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans cannot manufacture or produce those
particular amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to be consumed in the diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why they're considered to be
essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they are included here, I just
included the capital letters here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go through and find them if you'd
like, just to get you familiar with some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the coding systems that we use for
listing amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, within our proteins here,
amino acids are linked together,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're linked together by peptide
bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the result of dehydration
synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this kind of refer to and
mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're dehydrated, you're losing
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in this synthesis process,
there's actually a water molecule that's
[SPEAKER_00]: released.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think by linking these amino acids
together, there's going to be liters and
[SPEAKER_00]: liters of water generated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just only one little water
molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, it's not a massive amount
of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are dehydrating this process and
releasing water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the bond is formed, there's a
release of a water molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we could see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's happening between our two amino
acids here, amino acid one, amino acid
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also see the same thing in the
image over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This peptide bond to form OH plus H is
H2O, two hydrogens and an oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see the same thing here,
kind of highlighted here, where we have
[SPEAKER_00]: our two hydrogens and our oxygen forming
that water molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that's removed, then these are
linking together here, forming this
[SPEAKER_00]: peptide bond between that carbon and
nitrogen atom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, dehydration synthesis versus
hydrolysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember from one of the other
lectures, or you will be seeing hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: in the other lectures, something called
hydrolysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dehydration synthesis, they just talked
about removing water to link molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a bunch of molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're removing the water molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're linking them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrolysis is the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think of breaking it apart as
hydrolysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water and lysis means to cut or to break,
adding water to break bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a bunch of bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have water coming in, breaking
that apart and getting now into our
[SPEAKER_00]: individual kind of molecules or amino
acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case here, enzymes are responsible
for this breakdown and construction
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: More on that later and other videos that
you can check out if you are interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, proteins would be called
polypeptides.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a polypeptide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a long chain of amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see them here represented by
their three-liter code.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have kind of one, two, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10, all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: down here to 129.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just see how they're linked together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we have these long polypeptide
chains, sometimes those one-letter codes
[SPEAKER_00]: are advantageous to make it easier to kind
of read and go through the polypeptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So poly, meaning many peptide,
referring to the bonds, many of those
[SPEAKER_00]: bonds linked together, many of those amino
acids linked together by those peptide
[SPEAKER_00]: bonds makes a protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and we'll see you
next time.
