[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over how to
select the tomato seed or variety that is
[SPEAKER_00]: best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is not going to be a whole list
of variety names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to teach you how to think and go
about looking at your operation so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to determine the best selection
for your operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing is, well, where are you
growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing to consider is where
you're growing the crop and what growth
[SPEAKER_00]: habit you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at outdoor operation,
there's a lot of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at being under plastic,
typically determinants or
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-determinants will be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be a greenhouse, a high tunnel,
or a caterpillar tunnel, as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be more limited on the size of the
plant that they can get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second thing to consider is what your
market is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider your market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are you selling to and what do they
want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking for the perfect look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would it be more for hybrids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Heirlooms, people ask for them by name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large fruit for sandwiched tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really haven't seen too many deep blues
and purples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they offer a variety that may not be
found at some major chain places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you've got to look at what your
market is because that might dictate what
[SPEAKER_00]: variety or sway you in a direction for
what variety to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third item to consider is, well,
when are you growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for early season,
looking for short days to harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a quick turnaround time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your main season is going to be your core
plantings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for late season growth for
maybe considering greater disease
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance because typically later in the
season, there's more of that pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fourth is to try new varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But always have a standard for comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just try everything new.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't have that kind of sense of
comparison, then you might lose at how
[SPEAKER_00]: effective or how better one variety may
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: While experimenting is good, you don't
have that control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those trials are going to have less
meanings.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I use the Better Boy Tomato as my
comparison variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: To determine whether something is truly
better or worse than something I'm used to.
