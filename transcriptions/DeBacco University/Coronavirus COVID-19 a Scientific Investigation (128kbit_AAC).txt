[SPEAKER_00]: You may have been hearing a lot about the
coronavirus from a wide variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: sources, but here I'm going to provide a
scientific investigation related to the
[SPEAKER_00]: coronavirus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, where do you get information?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's constantly changing the
situation, at least as of right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great link to a website that
provides you a lot of scientific articles
[SPEAKER_00]: that may be a little detailed in the
reading, but definitely worthwhile and are
[SPEAKER_00]: staying up to date.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great information center on this novel
coronavirus as the situation develops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, key terms that are used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll hear a lot of terms used here or
hear about them in the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epidemic, pandemic, and endemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might think they're all
interchangeable when in fact they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The epidemic, for example, refers to an
increase often sudden in the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: cases of a disease beyond what is normally
expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as it visually look, well, an epidemic
would be like a region here showing a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of signs of disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ebola went through an epidemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pandemic is a worldwide spread of disease,
and that's kind of depicted here where you
[SPEAKER_00]: see it showing up all over the regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, localized in certain areas,
but overall spread over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an endemic, first a constant presence
or prevalence of a disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you can see it's not necessarily a
large cluster, which is kind of showing up
[SPEAKER_00]: all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of nice visual
representation of how these three terms
[SPEAKER_00]: differ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, pathogenicity, virulence,
and mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pathogenicity and virulence are
comparing those two, so this offers a good
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the ability for an organism to
cause disease, and virulence is the
[SPEAKER_00]: relative capacity of a pathogen to
overcome body defenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of how virulent is a
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means how likely is it to infect you
and cause a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mutation is simply a change in DNA
sequence, which leads to a change in
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it brings us to what's a virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, hear about the coronavirus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, do we even know what a virus is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a virus is an infected agent
typically consists of nucleic acid
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule in a protein coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very small, cannot be seen with a
traditional light microscope, and they
[SPEAKER_00]: multiply within a living host.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here the viruses bind the living
host, cause the host to mass multiply
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, and then release many more
particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That same viral DNA is being injected into
a cell and kind of overrides the cell's
[SPEAKER_00]: natural machinery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we say the term virus, this is what
the alligenic consists of, but they can
[SPEAKER_00]: have very different shapes here as we can
see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So viruses is a category, but within that
there's many sub-categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why are viruses hard to control?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the answer is they're continually
changing, they're continually mutating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coronavirus have frequent mutations and
recombination events are constantly going
[SPEAKER_00]: through changes in the hopes that they'll
become better fit for the environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the virus, and we hope to try to
create conditions that will reduce their
[SPEAKER_00]: fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peer studies have shown that SARS has
mutated over the 2002-2004 epidemic to
[SPEAKER_00]: better bind to cellular receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just shows, here's an example of a
virus going through a mutation that would
[SPEAKER_00]: cause it to be better fit in the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here would be less fit for the
environment, see the change in genes over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at letter C would be the most fit,
A would be one of the least fits here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, they're constantly changing,
which makes them difficult to pinpoint and
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, at the bottom of all these
slides where I've used them, I've tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide examples here of the links of
sources that I've used.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as in the description,
there's information as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So natural human fear of viruses,
well it's based on history.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Spanish flu, caused by the H1N1
influenza virus, infected 500 million
[SPEAKER_00]: people, almost a third of the world
population, and killed 25 to 50 million
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, viruses, we hear that term,
and naturally there's a fear because of
[SPEAKER_00]: what history has shown us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just take the flu for an example
here, looking at the CDC, estimates
[SPEAKER_00]: between 9 million and 45 million illnesses
occurred from the flu, 140 to 810
[SPEAKER_00]: hospitalizations, and 12,000 to 61,000
deaths since 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking back at the last couple years,
it varies year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see a lot more illnesses,
less hospitalizations, and luckily less
[SPEAKER_00]: deaths.
[SPEAKER_00]: The case fatality rate is 0.05%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that's the percentage of people
that do die from the influenza flu.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the RO value, which we'll talk about
later, is 1.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just remember these numbers,
we'll see how they compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just for regular influenza,
common cold, that typically spreads in the
[SPEAKER_00]: wintertime every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's take a better look at the
coronavirus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting to coronavirus, well,
there's coronaviruses, yes, and I put the
[SPEAKER_00]: S here with a question mark because it's
not just one type of virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the name for a family of viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: MERS, SARS, and now coronavirus all fall
into the same category.
[SPEAKER_00]: All three of these originate in bats,
which is kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have generally similar shapes,
so they're all in the coronavirus
[SPEAKER_00]: category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the coronavirus itself is kind of
assumed in look.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's named for the crown-like spikes on
the surface and a group of viruses that
[SPEAKER_00]: cause a significant percentage of all
common colds in human, adults,
[SPEAKER_00]: and children around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is a classification of
coronaviruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a general family, and they are
known to cause diseases in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I provide you with some of these specific
names here, and as well as the links at
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom of the page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what is known about the coronavirus at
least currently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, looking at the current, it
originated in Long China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Human-to-human transmission is typically
via droplets or direct contact,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the incubation period can be as long
as 24 days, with the median incubation
[SPEAKER_00]: being about 6.4 days, ranging from 2.1 to
11.1 days, and the 2.5 is to 97.5 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we take a look at the stats here,
we're looking at the vast majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: cases here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This area represented here and here would
be that 2.1 to 11.1 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 days seems to be kind of the longest
chance, and that's based on the sources
[SPEAKER_00]: provided here at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 2.1 to 11.1 days, typical incubation
period being as long as, in at least one
[SPEAKER_00]: case, 24 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epidemiology, so what we're looking at
here is a coronavirus that's highly
[SPEAKER_00]: contagious within about two-hour survival
time within the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: All age groups are susceptible to the
virus, very young to the very old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elderly patients with two chronic
conditions at the same time are more
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to experience severe illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just common that if an immune system
is already compromised or already valid in
[SPEAKER_00]: one disease and it gets infected with
another, it is more likely to cause death
[SPEAKER_00]: or more serious effects because of the
multiplication here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see just another example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just for coronavirus,
looking at arthritis and heart disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: diabetes, and being obese.
[SPEAKER_00]: A detailed replication of the
coronaviruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to spend a ton of time on
this, but you can see here's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: detailed sequence of steps just to give
you the idea of the complexities of the
[SPEAKER_00]: virus and how they have to bind the cells,
transfer their own DNA, kind of invade the
[SPEAKER_00]: cell's natural machinery, cause that cell
to mass-multiply the virus particles and
[SPEAKER_00]: export those particles to the outside of
the cells so they can go through and
[SPEAKER_00]: infect other cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, pretty complex process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why viruses can be difficult to
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just as easy as killing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really nothing to kill simply
because you have that protein coat and
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not living, breathing,
necessarily, particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: A reproduction number.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the RO factor here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at a little comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denarred by R0, and it refers to viral
transmissibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many people is one person likely to
infect?
[SPEAKER_00]: The epidemiology definition of RO is the
average number of people who will catch a
[SPEAKER_00]: disease from one contagious person.
[SPEAKER_00]: This applies to a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have an R0 of two, and you have
a patient zero, they will infect two
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of them can then go for, in fact,
about two people.
[SPEAKER_00]: SARS has an R0 of four, and you can see
how this one down here can quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: multiply in a much greater rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we take those R0 values into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, potential spread or decline of
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does these R0 refer to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if it's less than one, each existing
infectious causes less than one new
[SPEAKER_00]: infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's less than one.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, if we just think about this
logically, the disease will decline and
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually be non-existent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If R0 equals one, the disease will stay
alive, but there won't be an epidemic,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning one person will usually pass it to
one person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where diseases that get a little bit of
concern here is how much greater is it
[SPEAKER_00]: than one?
[SPEAKER_00]: This will cause the disease to grow
exponentially, potentially, causing an
[SPEAKER_00]: epidemic or even a pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the higher the number here,
the more people that can spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see measles here is 11 to 18,
means one infectious person will likely
[SPEAKER_00]: infect 11 to 18 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the R0 value for the coronavirus
here, from what's currently known,
[SPEAKER_00]: the calculated R0 value of coronavirus is
significantly greater than one,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this isn't to be concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: The preliminary R0 estimate is between 1.4
and 2.5, was presented at the World Health
[SPEAKER_00]: Organization statement in the information
here on January 23rd, year 2020,
[SPEAKER_00]: information here at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The case fatality rate is about 3%,
that means of all those infected,
[SPEAKER_00]: the 3% typically result in the fatality,
and the R0 value of 1.4 to 2.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all great numbers, but how does
this compare to other diseases?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look here at the kind of the
comparison to diseases over on this side
[SPEAKER_00]: here, we see the case fatality rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is in percentage, so that
coronavirus 3% will die, we'll compare to
[SPEAKER_00]: SARS 10%, MERS 40%, avian flu 40%,
you can see some really high values here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see some lower values as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the R0 values, again, for coronavirus
1.4, potentially as high as 5.5,
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see MERS here at less than one,
avian flu less than one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these have a very high fatality rate,
but very low to transmit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the corona, they say the highest
to be transmitted, and the highest case
[SPEAKER_00]: fatality rate, even though it's being
talked about in the news, it's spreading
[SPEAKER_00]: like crazy and killing everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the data here and put it a little
bit in perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: HIV is untreated 80% here without therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that case fatality rate much,
much higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, something to consider here,
at least put it in perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at a higher
pathogenicity trends, tends to have lower
[SPEAKER_00]: transmissibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at the influenza virus,
the pandemic of H1N1 virus caused
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively mild disease and became endemic
in the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: The balance of receptors in the upper
respiratory tract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to H7N9 virus, have a fatality
rate of approximately 40% very high,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can go back and take a look at
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has so far resulted in only a few small
clusters of human to human transmission,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then specifically bound receptors in
the lower respiratory tract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example is measles virus and the
rhinovirus have strong transmissibility,
[SPEAKER_00]: but low mortality rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, kind of get this trade off of
very high mortality rate, but very low to
[SPEAKER_00]: be transmitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of interesting to see this
trend occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, resource there at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pathogenicity and transmissibility of
the coronavirus currently seems to have
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively low pathogenicity and a
moderate transmissibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a comparison here of some other
viruses here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pause the slide and take a look at
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also welcome and encouraged to look at
some of the resources here that I pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: this information from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just tries to put it in
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just kind of that reality check here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CDC Center for Disease Controls and
World Health Organization are working on
[SPEAKER_00]: addressing the issue and providing
updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your goal is to inform yourself,
but be cautious of new sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting resources from scientific papers
may not be the easiest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets away from opinions and catchy
headlines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of these white papers are great to
get some data and some information rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than just reading a flashy headline and
jumping to a conclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also keep the situation in
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone looks here and sees the number
six, and someone over here sees the number
[SPEAKER_00]: nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: H1N1 had a very similar progression and
people are naturally afraid of something
[SPEAKER_00]: that has potential to cause death,
which viruses do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, how severe is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what precautions are being
taken?
[SPEAKER_00]: What precautions can you take?
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't something that's very,
very high mortality rate percentage wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So working together as long as
transmission of the virus from one person
[SPEAKER_00]: to another could be substantially
consistently interrupted.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could get through means of isolating
people and get that R not value less than
[SPEAKER_00]: one, it's entirely possible this outbreak
could be controlled or even eradicated
[SPEAKER_00]: going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this requires joint efforts of
the entire society.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as an example, polio was very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see how those numbers crashed
through a cooperative effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has to be a worldwide cooperative
effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the importance is education.
[SPEAKER_00]: So educating the communities and
strengthening public confidence will thus
[SPEAKER_00]: be important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's hopefully why you're watching
this video here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just provide yourself with some education,
provide yourself with some resources,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can approach this from more of a
scientific and not a headline format.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can be an informed person and
inform others with quality information.
