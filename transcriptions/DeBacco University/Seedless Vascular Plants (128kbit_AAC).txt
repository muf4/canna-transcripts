[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, as we go along, we're getting a
little bit more complex through our plant
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution, and we're at the point of
seedless vascular plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be familiar with the most common
example here, our ferns fall into the
[SPEAKER_00]: category of seedless vascular plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I use the term vascular, though,
you might be wondering, well, what does
[SPEAKER_00]: this refer to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, vascular tissues are specialized
cylindrical or elongated cells that form a
[SPEAKER_00]: network throughout the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of them as like the vessels going
through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two types of this vascular tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first type is called xylem,
and this conducts water and minerals from
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots upward to the rest of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Xylem works mainly in one direction,
starting at the roots, going up to what we
[SPEAKER_00]: call the shoots, and then ultimately the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water will then exit out the leaves
through the stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other vascular tissue is called
phloem, and this conducts carbohydrates
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, phloem can work both going from roots
to shoots, but it can also go from shoot
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrates down to roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phloem has the ability to move up and down
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why that's important is
carbohydrates need to be moved throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing a potato below ground,
that storage organ, the carbohydrates made
[SPEAKER_00]: in the leaf need to be moved down to the
potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have an actively growing apical
meristem, the growing tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to move carbohydrates from this
leaf up the plant to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phloem has the ability to go up and
down, and it's transporting mainly sugars
[SPEAKER_00]: such as carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Xylem is conducting water in some
minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mainly working from the roots upward
in one direction to the top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, believed to be the oldest remaining
group of the vascular plants, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: estimated to have been around 400 million
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever been walking in the woods,
you see these examples of a ground pine,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are kind of a subset of club mosses,
and you think they're going to get any
[SPEAKER_00]: taller, well, they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is their typical fully grown size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some other types of club mosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see they look very different,
and we're progressing along our
[SPEAKER_00]: collatogram here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working our way getting to
genusperms and angiosperms, but we see
[SPEAKER_00]: we've progressed from our mosses,
our horn warts, and our liver warts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these are all originated from our
common ancestor of green algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these seedless vascular plants,
ferns, as I said, is the most common one
[SPEAKER_00]: you're probably familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sporophyte generation is much larger
and more complex than the gametophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, gametophyte's going to produce
gametes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sporophyte's going to produce the spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves on a sporophyte are called fronds,
so this gets into just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: terminology here, and we're looking at
seedless vascular plants, in particular,
[SPEAKER_00]: ferns.
[SPEAKER_00]: This entire, this isn't called a leaf,
it's called a frond.
[SPEAKER_00]: This phylum also includes whisk ferns and
horsetails, also fall into this category.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blade is the area here, as we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the frond being the entire portion
and the blade being where we would
[SPEAKER_00]: typically say where the leaves are,
but each one of these are little leaflets,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is kind of all one continuous unit
here, and that is referred to,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, as the frond for ferns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the alternation of generations,
as I mentioned a little bit before,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I said, you're most familiar with the
large sporophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The haploid generation that's producing
the gametes here, the gametophyte looks
[SPEAKER_00]: very different, and those spores are
coming together as sorri on the underside
[SPEAKER_00]: of the fronds here that are falling to the
ground and are producing the gametophytes
[SPEAKER_00]: that produce both male and female
gametophytes, which are fertilized to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop the diploid organism here that
will then produce the sporophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, of the fern life cycle,
there's a rhizome, which is a modified
[SPEAKER_00]: underground stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The source, as I mentioned here,
is a collection of spores before producing
[SPEAKER_00]: sporangium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the little dots on the underside
of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever looked at a frond of a fern
leaf, you may see some little dots under
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the sporangium, and that's going to
produce the spores that ultimately produce
[SPEAKER_00]: the gametophytes that produce the next
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New England, early in the springtime,
you may see something called fiddleheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are young curled fronds,
and some are edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't last for very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early in the spring, typically months of
April and May, you may see these kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: curled up things starting to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are small little curled up fronds of
a fern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people really like them, and there's
certain varieties that are edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see them as listed as restaurants,
as fresh plants that you can eat.
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
