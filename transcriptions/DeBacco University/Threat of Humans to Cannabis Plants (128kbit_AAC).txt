[SPEAKER_00]: So this Tobacco University video is going
to take into account the threat of humans
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the threat of humans outside
of the grower, your neighbors,
[SPEAKER_00]: and people around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What threats they can pose to cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into the threat of
humans to cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, people and the cannabis
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, after all the challenges of growing,
people can be another issue that's worth
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two main methods of negative impacts can
be complaints as well as physical damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: When some growers will set this signs up,
stop, you're on camera about the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to see anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want anyone to steal anything,
and rightfully so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep this in mind that humans are
another kind of quote unquote pest you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be mindful of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at the complaint end
of things, before you start growing an
[SPEAKER_00]: operation, it's wise to inform your
neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: For indoor growing, this may mean the need
to add additional carbon filters or other
[SPEAKER_00]: means to reduce odor of the plants,
because some people simply just do not
[SPEAKER_00]: like or can't stand the odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor growing, it's a good practice to
let others know and show them paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have it regarding your license,
ensure that they don't necessarily get
[SPEAKER_00]: surprised all these cannabis plants going
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know you're doing it in a legit
manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then know your local regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter the size of your operations,
know your local and current laws regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are very loose regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others are much more stringent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be aware of the total plant number,
number that you have in veg and flour,
[SPEAKER_00]: what does approved varieties and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure you know your laws,
your rules, your regulations, and that you
[SPEAKER_00]: are also in compliance with all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for outdoor growers, we're looking at
the are suggested that they may want to
[SPEAKER_00]: post signs that state no trespassing at
property boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also maybe inform people if they're
growing industrial hemp with no THC to
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage people not to be removing
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be also on the lookout for trespassers,
as this can involve the use of cameras and
[SPEAKER_00]: monitoring systems as we see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: File a trespass action request form.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this applies to your area, if you do
catch someone, this can offer a formal
[SPEAKER_00]: documentation of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secure your property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use of fences can make it clear boundary
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patrol your properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can help you catch a potential issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early utilize your local neighborhood
watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have others in your area contact you if
they see something suspicious part of that
[SPEAKER_00]: local network.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this is advised to try to limit the
negative impact other humans can have on
[SPEAKER_00]: your cannabis crop.
