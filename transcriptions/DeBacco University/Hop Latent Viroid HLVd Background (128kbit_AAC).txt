[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
we're going to go over the hop latent
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty extensive looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a full understanding of this
viroid that's becoming more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: prevalent and getting talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So glad to hear you're checking on this
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to provide you some
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to learn more about this hop
latent viroid and kind of where it came
[SPEAKER_00]: from and how it became established.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, great research article.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hop latent viroid, a hidden threat to
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to learn more information,
welcome to check this as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: information in the description as well for
the references.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was first found in hops and that's
actually where the name came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hop latent viroid in 1987.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viruses and viroids often get their name
connected with the plant species,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was first identified in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was first identified in hops,
which is a close relative of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this does not mean it only
infects the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it signifies that plant tissue was
found in and can spread to others as we've
[SPEAKER_00]: now kind of seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1987, those first report of a presence of
a viroid-like RNA and nucleic acid
[SPEAKER_00]: preparations from two of three commercial
hop varieties grown in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to look at the original
article, it was published in 1988,
[SPEAKER_00]: provide you a link there and a picture of
the first page.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what hops look like if you haven't
seen those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this was originally called duds or
dudding disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially detected in 2019, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 1987 to 2019, a long time there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early on, it was called duds or dudding
diseases of cannabis, which later turned
[SPEAKER_00]: out to be hop latent viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently hop latent viroid has become the
most devastating cannabis disease in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis growing areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sadly, it's very widespread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually widespread than I think
most realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a survey conducted in 2021 by the Dark
Heart Nursery Research that involved
[SPEAKER_00]: 200,000 tissue tests concluded that 90% of
cannabis growing facilities in California
[SPEAKER_00]: were contaminated with hop latent viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, realize it's not just contained
to California.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is only where the geographic sample
for the survey was conducted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hop latent viroid has been detected
throughout the cannabis growing facilities
[SPEAKER_00]: of entire North America and probably
beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't think it's just California.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just where they did the original
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is this a concern?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't heard about it,
why should we be concerned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, infected crops could suffer anywhere
from a 50 to 70% lost in the THC content,
[SPEAKER_00]: thus considerably lowering their
commercial value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could also affect CBD as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another cannabinoids, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A survey conducted in 2001, again,
revealed that approximately 90% of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis growing facilities in that
California tested positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 30% of the plants in each facility
showed symptoms of this viroids infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's a very widespread issue
that might be initially going unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is it called a latent viroid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did it kind of get that name from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, originally it was tentatively hop
viroid like RNA fast was its original
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it is similar to avocado sunblotch
viroid, but had different physical as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as biological properties with faster
electrophoric mobility than the hop stunt
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: 17,000 hectares of hop gardens in Germany
was surveyed for this kind of hop viroid
[SPEAKER_00]: like RNA fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was found in all of the hop
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worldwide testing showed the presence of
hop latent viroid in most of the hop
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's a little bit of a scary
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing this so widespread.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, since this hop viroid like RNA
fast did not induce any visible disease
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms, at least in hops, it was
tentatively named hop latent viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of where we get the name that
we still use today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hidden disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're looking at hops here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although hop latent viroid infected hop
plants are symptomless, infection
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly does reduce their marketable
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yield and other bitter acids and
essential oil content in the hop cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, does create a reduced efficiency
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subsequently, hop latent virus detected 90
to 100% of the tested hop germ plasms in
[SPEAKER_00]: European countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think 90 plus percent, a little bit
an area of concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this kind of mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's again, some more of the background
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we kind of looking at here?
[SPEAKER_00]: When it was first being discovered,
at least in hops, there were no really
[SPEAKER_00]: found effects, which means it's present,
but not really causing a noticeable
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, latent is referring to being
asymptomatic, meaning that it is there,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's present physically there,
but not really visually noticeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about asymptomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what does that kind of really
referring to?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there, but really no issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always say that, well, not exactly,
because even though this is the name
[SPEAKER_00]: given, even in hops, it can cause an issue
with oil and acid levels affecting that
[SPEAKER_00]: final crop, even though it may not cause a
visual in your face kind of look to the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, it's causing that reduction in
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, depending on the cultivar of the
hops, the degree to which it has an impact
[SPEAKER_00]: can also vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: In chemists, this virid is not
asymptomatic, so it does show visual
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it can also have secondary impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at a plant that's
infected, it can become more susceptible
[SPEAKER_00]: to other diseases, particularly fusarium
and powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great researcher provided a link
in the description here, providing some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these images just to kind of give you that
kind of example of how when you get this
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid, you can get other issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while both of these leaves do have
powdery mildew, you can see one clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: has it more severe than the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is positive for hoplite and viroid,
this is negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing observed with fusarium,
which is a root-based disease that will
[SPEAKER_00]: then infect the xylem of the stem tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it does seem to be stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of an interesting part of
this viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, genetic screening seems to be
showing minimum variability across
[SPEAKER_00]: geographic regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even back to the 1980s, hop viroid has not
really undergone a lot of mutations
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to what was found today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is really interesting because
considering we see viroids to higher
[SPEAKER_00]: eukaryotes, considering the small number
of nucleotides, it's a good thing as
[SPEAKER_00]: changes or mutations can occur very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a smaller genome size,
your rate of mutation typically is higher,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this hoplite and viroid is showing
some stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other viroids do show changes,
mutations, and sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there's a host change, so that needs
to be taken into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, at least right now,
early indications of this viroid,
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty stable, pretty consistent sequence,
at least for most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now secondary structure for viroids is
important because viroids do lack a
[SPEAKER_00]: protein coat like a virus would have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So secondary structure is key to determine
its ability to infect a particular host
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Investigating the secondary structure is
important for understanding the
[SPEAKER_00]: host-viroid relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of think about this as the
secondary structure, just the shape it's
[SPEAKER_00]: taking on, kind of like the key and the
lock concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key changes and the lock stays the
same, while it's not going to be really a
[SPEAKER_00]: good fit, and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of that host-viroid
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a lot of changes, will it
potentially make it more virulent or
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly potentially less virulent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have also sequence variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hoplite and viroid species isolate from
hops, and this is all kind of provided
[SPEAKER_00]: here in JingBank.
[SPEAKER_00]: The account number and the numbers,
if you want to go back and take a look at
[SPEAKER_00]: it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the hoplite and viroid sequences
are isolated from cannabis plants were
[SPEAKER_00]: compared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of what the information we have,
taking that, comparing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the hoplite and viroid sequences
isolated from cannabis plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: available in the NCBI were retrieved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of look at it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the full length sequences,
250 nucleotides, was considered for this
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis that's going to be presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's CAN1 and CAN2, two distinctive
hoplite and viroid isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the exact numbers and codings
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're not bacteria, I just put
bacterial images here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about isolates, this is kind
of what we think of, but we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about something that can only be seen with
the electron microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for CAN1, 100% sequence similarity to
the hoplite and viroid type species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: CAN2 had one mismatch, meaning it had a
point mutation at the nucleotide number
[SPEAKER_00]: 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 225 catas nucleotides, there was a
mutation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the uracil mutated to the adenine.
[SPEAKER_00]: As compared to the hoplite and viroid type
species, and this was referred to as
[SPEAKER_00]: U225A.
[SPEAKER_00]: CAN2 isolate was 100% identical to hoplite
and viroid isolate retrieved from a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial hop garden in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can kind of have that example of
that matching there on the sequence basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are these isolates actually been
found?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they've actually been found in Delta
County, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was found to be 100% similar to CAN1
isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: CAN2 matched with hoplite and viroid
isolate in both Santa Barbara,
[SPEAKER_00]: California, as well as Boulder counties in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to give you that little kind of
idea here, we're looking at this area
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and then in two counties here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: This indicates the presence of at least
two hoplite and viroid sequence variants,
[SPEAKER_00]: infecting cannabis, but we're not going
much beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just lastly, I just want to talk about
that U225A, the single nucleotide change
[SPEAKER_00]: did not affect the structure of the CAN2
isolate as compared to that of the type
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note this change is located within the
lower pathogenicity domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to really change the
virulence there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit more detailed than
you may want, but that is the secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boxed region here is the terminal
conservative hairpin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And central conservative regions there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arrow indicates the U225A point mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: See again that uracil go down to adenine,
observed in the hoplite and viroid isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: from a commercial hop garden in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see again, not a lot of
sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very small compared to other
genomes of bacteria, eukaryotes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's that little mutation,
not really increasing the pathogenicity,
[SPEAKER_00]: showing a very stable viroid, giving us
something we can hopefully be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: target and attack without dealing with a
whole lot of variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
