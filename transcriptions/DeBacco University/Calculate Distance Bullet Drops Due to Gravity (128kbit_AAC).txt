[SPEAKER_00]: So with all the factors that can impact
kind of a bullet, here we're going to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at calculating the distance a bullet drops
due to gravity, for example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the acceleration of gravity,
which is an important factor to keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the acceleration of gravity is a
constant for free-falling objects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking specifically here for Earth,
a free-falling object has an acceleration
[SPEAKER_00]: rate of 9.8 meters per second squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of gives you that visual
representation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to accelerate the distance here
at the same time points.
[SPEAKER_00]: One second, two seconds, three,
four, and five seconds becomes greater
[SPEAKER_00]: because that object is accelerating in a
free-fall due to gravity at the rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: 9.8 meters per second squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how far did the bullet fall due to
gravity?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is assuming a free-fall and no air
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can imagine, someone who jumps
out of a plane is going very quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when they open the parachute or
increase their air resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: their rate of fall decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is a free-fall assuming no
air resistance to make the calculations
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the distance dropped,
or big D, little d, the equation is
[SPEAKER_00]: distance dropped equals g, which is
gravity, times time squared divided by
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, we're going to use the
constant for gravity at 9.8 meters per
[SPEAKER_00]: second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my practice example, what is the
distance dropped for an object that
[SPEAKER_00]: free-falls for 3.0 seconds?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here's our time 3.0 seconds
squared times 9.8 meters per second
[SPEAKER_00]: divided by two will give us the answer of
the distance dropped, and you should get
[SPEAKER_00]: 44.1 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two more example problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked you through the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one was the distance dropped for
an object that free-falls for 2.5 seconds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the second example was the distance
dropped for an object that free-falls for
[SPEAKER_00]: 5.0 seconds, or double the amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go through and grab a
calculator, grab a pencil, grab something
[SPEAKER_00]: to write with, and go through and solve
these problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to reveal the answers,
so hopefully you've paused the video and
[SPEAKER_00]: solved those problems, because here are
the answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example one would be 30.6 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example two, 122.5 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example where even though
we've doubled the time, it doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: we've doubled the distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, it's 9.8 meters per second
squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that kind of exponential kind of
increase there, that acceleration,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how would this apply?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we want to apply these calculations
to a crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can be used to try to determine kind
of where that shooter may have occurred,
[SPEAKER_00]: where that angle may have happened,
how far did it fall, where's a convergent
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a lot of things to consider,
and typically if you string out the
[SPEAKER_00]: straight direction of travel and the angle
drop, you will determine the angle or
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees the shooter from the target.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's important to go through
and do this calculation, because it can
[SPEAKER_00]: help you try to pinpoint what may have
gone wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: on at a crime scene.
