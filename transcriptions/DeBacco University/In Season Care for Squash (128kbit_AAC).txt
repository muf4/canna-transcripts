[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're gonna look at some
in-season care options for squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a cucumber row, a farmer that
I visited, and we see these, they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: only suppressing weeds within the row,
but also in between the rows where these
[SPEAKER_00]: vines are about to run to to help reduce
soil splashes and for the fruit to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning, time spent scrubbing,
so this is something worth consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the first part we want to consider
when we're looking at squash, this almost
[SPEAKER_00]: happens before the in-season part,
is to ensure you're spacing your squash
[SPEAKER_00]: properly, depending on the variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll hear terms like vine, semi-vine,
compact vine, semi-bush, and bush use,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this gives some suggestions on how far
they should be spaced both in the row and
[SPEAKER_00]: also between rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a first kind of step to ensuring
that while everything may initially kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of end and run together, they're not
having a lot of overlap, which can create
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of disease issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of that weed control,
growing on fabric is good for winter
[SPEAKER_00]: squash to reduce soil splash on the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that here, in particular melon crops
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: In-row weed suppression, if some kind is
recommended, seems going down here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also considering in between that row
weed block there, has some benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can the cost be justified?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers will say yes, some growers
will say no, but keep in mind your time in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ease of harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it really easy when there's no
weeds in between here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, plant cleanup becomes a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irrigation, so within row weed
suppression, irrigation can also be
[SPEAKER_00]: considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see drip irrigation being the most
obvious choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overhead can be used and act as kind of a
panic backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also increase powdery mild if it's
not timed well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to irrigate with overhead
irrigation, actually in the morning with
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy dew is probably a good time because
the leaves will already be wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, once established, often the need
for irrigation can be reduced in squash in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at especially that early on
to get those plants and those roots
[SPEAKER_00]: established well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you're planting successive
crops and you want to have periods of high
[SPEAKER_00]: heat, you want to ensure that they're able
to survive and get established before
[SPEAKER_00]: they're able to have a sufficient root
system to scavenge for water by
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you next time.
