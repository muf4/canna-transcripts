[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to be investigating
the vertebral column.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the picture here, we may think of
this as the vertebral column, and it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: but only this portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pelvis is actually also included in
this image, which is not part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: vertebral column.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to learn about the different
sections and why it has the curves and be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to identify different regions and
also some potential spinal issues that may
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, starting with this vertebral column is
formed by 26 irregular bones called
[SPEAKER_00]: vertebrae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're connected in such a way that's
flexible curve structure that results in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cervical vertebrae, which are the ones
on top, the thoracic vertebrae,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is located here, the lumbar
vertebrae, and then the sacrum down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's important to have these bends
and curves in the vertebrae, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: we may think of it as a solid straight
line, it's actually not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have posteriorly concave curvatures of
the cervical and the lumbar, and remember,
[SPEAKER_00]: concave, our lenses are shaped like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The convex curvatures of the thoracic and
the sacral, here's our thoracic,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's our sacral, and that is in the
convex curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of relates that same image to
the human body, so you can get an idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: where these are located in the general
size comparison of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why these curves are important
is it helps increase the strength and also
[SPEAKER_00]: the flexibility of the spine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the curvature again, kind of shown,
and also showing again that vertebral
[SPEAKER_00]: column in the different regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our thoracic vertebrae located here,
and here's our thoracic curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, two special ones are what's called C1
and C2.
[SPEAKER_00]: C1 is so special it actually has its own
name, it's called the atlas, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the very first one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It holds the head up and it's totally
unique in that it's considered the yes
[SPEAKER_00]: joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're making the yes movement,
that's because of the C1, that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning that occurs there.
[SPEAKER_00]: C2 directly below that is called the axis,
and this is the joint between the C1 and
[SPEAKER_00]: the C2 is called the no joint,
and that's the one that works in this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one vertebrae is responsible for this
kind of rotating motion, and C1 is
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for this motion, the up and
down, the yes and the no joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to have you identify those
in an X-ray that can be difficult,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just remember C1 is the atlas
responsible for the yes, and C2 is the
[SPEAKER_00]: axis responsible for the no joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the typical structure of a vertebrae
is here, and I'm not going to quiz you
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily on all the details of it,
but I do want to draw your attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: some names that you should be coming
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prosterior and anterior.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows you to orient yourself where
this is located.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our posterior is totally on the back,
so this anterior will be pointing more
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the center portion of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our superior view is looking kind of
straight down, and again we see here,
[SPEAKER_00]: our posterior, our true back, and our
anterior portion here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, be familiar with these terms so
you can orient yourself with different
[SPEAKER_00]: bone structures and when you go into
dissections also.
[SPEAKER_00]: The discs within the vertebrae here,
we have some cartilage, and it's important
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have that cartilage to act as kind
of a cushion between the two discs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to have bone on bone,
it's going to be extremely painful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have that slight give there,
and that's possible by the discs made of
[SPEAKER_00]: cartilage located between the two
vertebrae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember our lateral view and our superior
view, that should help you orient where
[SPEAKER_00]: this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this cartilage is providing padding,
it's allowing movement within the
[SPEAKER_00]: vertebrae, so you can twist and turn
without feeling massive pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regional characteristics of the vertebrae,
again I'm not going to spend a ton of time
[SPEAKER_00]: in having to identify one vertebrae of
what particular region it might be located
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want you to realize that there are
different regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see the cervical vertebrae,
these are the ones on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember our C1 and our C2 are yes and a
no, our atlas and our axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see them labeled here again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working our way down, our thoracic
vertebrae.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that they're shaped a little
differently, and they have this curve to
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're supporting the thoracic cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working our way further down, our lumbar
vertebrae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting it a little bit larger,
because again, we have more weight to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of hold up and support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, at the very end here,
our sacrum and our coxal vertebrae,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the very bottom here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're kind of fused together,
they're not really independent and
[SPEAKER_00]: separate, and they can't really move like
the other ones can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our anterior view and our
posterior view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that should help you orient
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Types of spinal cord injuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spinal cord injuries are catastrophic
injuries that may permanently alter lives
[SPEAKER_00]: of about 282,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: US citizens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending where that spinal cord injury
occurs can determine the percent of the
[SPEAKER_00]: body or portion of the body that becomes
paralyzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key take-home message here is the
further up that damage occurs,
[SPEAKER_00]: the greater portion of the body that
becomes affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's affected in the lower region here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it's just the legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It occurs up here towards the cervical
vertebrae region.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a much larger portion that becomes
paralyzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some abnormal spine curvatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scoliosis might be most familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Abnormal lateral curve in the spine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caffeosis, which is a hunchback kind of
look.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see kind of here, very exaggerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lordosis is swayback, where we have
that kind of typically occurs with
[SPEAKER_00]: pregnant females that have this kind of
odd bend to their spine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, both of these are referring to the
bending looking at it from the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're seeing that kind of left to
right curvature of the spine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scoliosis can be corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a brace that can help reduce the
degree of curvature from that left to
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can help correct that and allow
that individual to live a closer to normal
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, damage to the invertible discs
cause a slipped disc or herniated disc,
[SPEAKER_00]: both extremely painful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see here we have that kind of
pinched in of the nerve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So never do we want our nerves to be
pinched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never do we want bone on bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, it's going to be an
extremely painful occurrence for this
[SPEAKER_00]: individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially occurs typically here,
indicated in the lower back, the lumbar
[SPEAKER_00]: spine.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of weight is applied here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of support that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of pinched nerve can cause a
lot of pain for the individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's very important to have the
cartilage at a nice equal spacing for the
[SPEAKER_00]: vertebrae and not pinching any of the
nerves to allow freedom of movement
[SPEAKER_00]: without a high degree of pain.
