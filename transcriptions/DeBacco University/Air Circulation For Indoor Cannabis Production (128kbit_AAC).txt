[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over air circulation for
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're growing cannabis indoors,
we know the importance of air circulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: so let's learn about some of the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, it is important because
indoor growing environments are protected
[SPEAKER_00]: areas that limit natural airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: While some pruning methods can help open
up a plant structures, there still is no
[SPEAKER_00]: substitute for moving air with in a grow
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fans are highly recommended to help aid
this process, and air circulation can help
[SPEAKER_00]: strengthen plants and also reduce pest and
disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large and small large spaces need air
movement, so just because you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in one area versus another, I don't think
it's any more or less important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in just one plant,
air movement is still important.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a small grow tent, this can be as
simple as a little six inch fan,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we kind of see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in larger grow spaces, this can mean
large oscillating fans in multiples of
[SPEAKER_00]: them, and putting different directions
help move air through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, whether it's a small space,
large space, one plant, many plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: air movement is still important and
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how long should the fan be on?
[SPEAKER_00]: People wonder, well, if I should I put a
timer on my fan?
[SPEAKER_00]: And really unlike lights, fans should be
running 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should always be moving air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when plants are, quote, resting in
the dark or night cycle, moving air is
[SPEAKER_00]: still important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving air can help reduce the humidity
and moisture accumulation on the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: surface to help mitigate potential disease
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see in this facility,
we see fans on the wall, we see fans on
[SPEAKER_00]: the floor, again, pointing different
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are oscillating, keeping that air
moving all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horizontal airflow is something else we
want to consider, and oscillating fans
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize the airflow in the growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a general rule, you want to select a
fan with a CFM, which stands for cubic
[SPEAKER_00]: feet per minute, equal to or greater than
the size of your growing space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a growing space of 1,000 cubic
feet, you should have about 1,000 CFM fan,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to, again, give you an idea of the
approximate size to match your growing
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want to be considering the
vertical kind of airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will mix the air to avoid temperature
stratification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, hot air wants to rise,
cold air wants to sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure we're kind of mixing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: While important, too much of a good thing
can have a negative impact, especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow space is being enriched with
carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I make that note in the sense that we
don't want to aggressively mix our air
[SPEAKER_00]: vertically because we might be exhausting
out more carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is good also to think about in that
vertical sense to keep the air moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, kind of a way to ensure that
you're able to adjust the conditions to
[SPEAKER_00]: best match the number of plants or size of
plants that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a fan that can be linked up to a
fan speed control is a good option to
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having control over fan speed can help
ensure that the correct amount of air
[SPEAKER_00]: movement can be achieved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this allows adjustments to be made
over the growing cycle, number of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that might be moved in or moved out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just good to have this as an
option as you're looking at maximizing air
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation around your plants to create a
healthy and supportive growing environment.
