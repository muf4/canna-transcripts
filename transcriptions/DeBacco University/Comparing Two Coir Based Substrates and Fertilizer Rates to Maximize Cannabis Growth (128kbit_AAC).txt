[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to present a study where they
[SPEAKER_00]: compare two cocoa coir-based substrates
and fertilizer rates to maximize cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to see, and I'll share
with you some of the data presented in
[SPEAKER_00]: that study.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into comparing some
two coir-based substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, as always, here's the
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the front page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's this proper citation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a link.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want some more information about
it, this is where you would go through and
[SPEAKER_00]: look for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only going to provide a brief summary
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, chemical and physical
properties of the substrate that they use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the specifics?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is in the very important
materials and methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see the total porosity
presented here, plus or minus,
[SPEAKER_00]: how they're close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, to make note of the growing
substrates, you see a U1-HP and just a U1.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the different types of
substrates that they used.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both based from a company out of
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you want to research those
further, these do provide you with also
[SPEAKER_00]: the EC, which stands for Electrical
Connectivity, pH, and nutrient content
[SPEAKER_00]: here measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just see that for basic
properties of these two substrates that
[SPEAKER_00]: are used in this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: That responds to cannabis yield to
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is a very important point
to understand, is that they did use a
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a Nucchi Plus Organic Grow Liquid
Organic Fertilizer, a 4, 1.3, 1.7.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a nitrogen, phosphorus,
a potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's kind of their fertilizer rate
and their floral dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is important for growers
to realize, is that as they're increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer rate, yes, they did get an
increase in floral dry weight,
[SPEAKER_00]: to a certain point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you hit that kind of optimum level,
as they kept adding or increased the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer rate, you notice the floral dry
weight of grams per plant did decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after about 400 micrograms of nitrogen
per liter, we're noticing a decrease here
[SPEAKER_00]: in the floral dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is important for growers to
understand why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are increasing our cost while also
decreasing our yield, not a direction that
[SPEAKER_00]: is very profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is an optimum rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: More is not better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the relationship between THC and
the dry flower and fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're kind of seeing that same
relationship here.
[SPEAKER_00]: More fertilizer is not better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will actually reduce the floral dry
weight and also not only the mass,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also the percentage of THC in this
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to fertilize this with the
optimum level and not get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where that optimum rate here,
we can see for this study where that lies,
[SPEAKER_00]: adding more is not going to produce more,
contrary to a lot of growers think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the researchers conclusions
based on this study?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the optimum rate for fertilizer for
them supplying, based on the math that
[SPEAKER_00]: they did, was close to that 400,
but that 389 milligrams of nitrogen per
[SPEAKER_00]: liter for the fertilizer that they chose
to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the vegetative growth stage of cannabis
using aqua-based organic substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, very specific here, but provides
you with a good starting point and a good
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding, hopefully, that over adding
or adding more nutrients than this level
[SPEAKER_00]: that was suggested by the researchers will
not only decrease your mass of dry weight,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also decrease your percentage of
cannabinoids potentially produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find that optimum rate, fertilizer at
that rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't add more because you might end up
getting less.
