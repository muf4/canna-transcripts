[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to tie in a little
bit of one of the large and little groups
[SPEAKER_00]: of dinosaurs and the evolution of
dinosaurs and how that kind of relates and
[SPEAKER_00]: provide a local connection for those that
live in southern New England.
[SPEAKER_00]: So evolution of dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see our different time periods and
our progression and branch points of
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, we see around here, around 65
million years ago, it's kind of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctive stop where they all kind of
reach an end point and modern day is up
[SPEAKER_00]: here and you can see the branch point that
made it to the end and how many different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of species and subsets were ended
around that 65 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So evolution of dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the Triassic period.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the oldest known fossils.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have small carnivous dinosaurs dominate
this time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when I say small, I'm talking about
330 to 440 estimated pounds here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were successful because their legs
were directly under their body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides good support, being more
agile, being fast runners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're well adapted to dry conditions and
mass extinction of other amphibians
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced to competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at what makes an organism
survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will this organism fit its environment
very well?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're talking about the Triassic
period in particular, talking about that
[SPEAKER_00]: 208 plus million years ago, then it goes
to Jurassic and then Cretaceous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The period does all part of the Metazoic
era and then we get close to modern day
[SPEAKER_00]: and dinosaurs became extinct at the end of
the Cretaceous period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, around that plus or minus 65
million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Pangea and the dinosaurs, remember the
world looked very different around 200
[SPEAKER_00]: million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drier climate, the mass extinctions that
have occurred, diversity filled niches
[SPEAKER_00]: left by these extinct species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Metazoic era is considered the age of
reptiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: 235 million years ago, dinosaurs dominated
the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pangea separated climates and changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dinosaurs became extinct while new species
flourished.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this kind of, initially this is
kind of how it looked.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all our continents kind of colored
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Pangea is that one single land mass
that eventually all broke apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, even today, the
continents are still moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Providing a local connection, Dinosaur
State Park located in Rocky Hill,
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecticut, they accidentally found 2,000
dinosaur tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's uncovered during the excavation
for a new building in 1966.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally one of the operators of the
equipment, Bulldozer, sat down to have
[SPEAKER_00]: lunch and looked down and saw what he
thought was dinosaur footprints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that led to other people looking and
eventually the discovery of these 2,000
[SPEAKER_00]: tracks within a rock layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than 500 of the tracks are now
enclosed within the exhibit center's
[SPEAKER_00]: geodesic dome, which is open to the
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the remaining 1,500 are still buried
for preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they look quite good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very well preserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the model dinosaurs
that you can see in the Dinosaur State
[SPEAKER_00]: Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an important Dinosaur State Park in
Rocky Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a side note, the footprints are named
separately from the dinosaur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since conditions that preserve
footprints do not preserve bones,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically like a mudslide is great for
preserving bones, not great for
[SPEAKER_00]: footprints, the footprint is given its own
unique name compared to the likely
[SPEAKER_00]: dinosaur that made them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the actual footprints in Connecticut
are called ubrontes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a positive footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dinosaur actually stepped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a kind of a downward
depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: The negative print is a raised region.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the sediment that filled in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, in order to get accurate
footprints, we need the dinosaur to step
[SPEAKER_00]: in mud.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a thin layer of mica or some other
substance to come in that can separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need sediment to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, this is like a rising and
falling tide, and that allows these two
[SPEAKER_00]: sections to separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get the footprint but not that thin
layer of mica to be able to separate it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like you walking on the beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: More sand fills in, and you never know
that you stepped there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Positive is where the dinosaur stepped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Negative is the sediment that fills in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dinosaur that we believe made those is
called Dilophosaurus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nearest bones that those were found
were in Arizona, far cry from Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it matches the same approximate height
and weight and lived around the same time
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've seen Jurassic Park,
Dilophosaurus looks something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of Hollywood taking their
own liberties with developing what they
[SPEAKER_00]: may think is a cool looking dinosaur.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind, that's Hollywood,
and that is nowhere near the accuracy of
[SPEAKER_00]: what we believe Dilophosaurus looked like.
Thank you.
Thank you.
