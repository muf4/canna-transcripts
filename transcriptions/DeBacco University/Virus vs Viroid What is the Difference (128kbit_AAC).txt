[SPEAKER_00]: On this Debaco University video,
I'm going to go over the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between a virus and a viroid, so you can
understand the difference and the
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctions between these two,
which are typically used as
[SPEAKER_00]: interchangeable terms when they shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over a virus versus a
viroid and what the actual difference is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see visually there is a large
difference, the virus here and the viroid
[SPEAKER_00]: here, the simpler image, because it is a
simpler molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with a virus, probably what
you're more familiar with, or at least
[SPEAKER_00]: have heard more of, it's basically a
nucleic acid wrapped in a protein coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a DNA molecule or an RNA
molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: A virus is an infectious agent consisting
of segmented, this nucleic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, I said DNA or RNA, could be
single-stranded or could also be
[SPEAKER_00]: double-stranded DNA or RNA, kind of a
unique feature to viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that protein coat is the surrounding
protective strand structure for a virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viruses cannot replicate by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need a host cell to infect,
to change the machinery, to get the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: to make more virus particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that host cell, that could be a plant
cell, that could be an animal cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: the components of those are needed to
assemble and produce new viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, viruses don't have a single shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see here just some examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see some have a very straight
shape, like tobacco mosaic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some look very alien-like and some look
very spherical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some can look like a bullet shaped,
all different morphologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now going on to a viroid, they are very
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I say simple, they're one of the
most simple structures we know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're 50 to 80 times smaller than the
smallest viral genomes right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, virus are the smallest known
infectious agents that mainly cause
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not too much of an animal factor here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are free-floating, a piece of
circular genetic information, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very small in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So small they can only be seen here as an
electron microscope, as these images
[SPEAKER_00]: depict.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, comparison between our viruses and
our viroids is kind of a couple key
[SPEAKER_00]: differences here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viruses are small and simple, but viroids
are smaller and even more simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way to think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viruses do have that protein coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have nucleic acids, infectious to all
organisms, plants or animals, and viroids
[SPEAKER_00]: have no protein coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are mainly composed of RNA,
as far as their nucleic acids are
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned, and they are in fact mainly in
only plants that we know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viruses, again, a little bit broader host
range and a little bit more complexity,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though they're still very simple
compared to a cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, also I want to keep in mind,
this is a key distinction, is that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: the appropriate time to use the word
strain when referring to viruses,
[SPEAKER_00]: the variants, the strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shouldn't be referring to cannabis as a
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really reserved for the viral
taxonomy and way of naming things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strain, really we should be using
cultivar, variety, and we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strain should be reserved to viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for your attention.
See you next time.
