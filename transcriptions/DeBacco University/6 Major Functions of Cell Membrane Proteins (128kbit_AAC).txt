[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is an excellent title slide
showing the six major functions of
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest you watch the video and you come
back to this and use this kind of as a
[SPEAKER_00]: self-quiz and can you understand all these
images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now they may not make a lot of
sense, but if you look through the slides
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one on each and then come back to
this and hopefully it will make more
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the major functions is
transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: This slide may look familiar from one of
the previous ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an important function.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different forms of transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general here on the left side of the
image we have our proteins that span the
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: These may provide hydrophilic channels
across membranes that is selective for a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular cell unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case it's allowing the little
green molecules to come through.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right side of the image these
carrier proteins require energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actively grabbing these more oval
molecules and transporting them through
[SPEAKER_00]: the phospholipid bilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another major function is enzymatic
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: A protein built into the membrane may be
an enzyme with the active site exposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: the substances in adjacent solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases several enzymes in the
membrane are organized as a team that
[SPEAKER_00]: carries out sequential steps of metabolic
pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the example here we have lactose
and remember ACE at the end of any word
[SPEAKER_00]: indicates it could be an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taking our lactose and breaking them
apart this disaccharide into its two
[SPEAKER_00]: monosaccharides a glucose and a galactose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our disaccharide lactose being
broken apart into its two monosaccharides
[SPEAKER_00]: glucose and galactose.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because of enzymatic activity
that's embedded into the membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember enzymes are specific types of
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: All enzymes are proteins but not all
proteins are enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Signal transduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a membrane protein may have a binding
site with a specific shape that fits the
[SPEAKER_00]: shape of the chemical messenger such as a
hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The external messenger signal may cause a
conformational change in the protein
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor that relays that message inside
the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That simply means we have a receptor
protein embedded in the C cell membrane
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's binding to a specific hormone and
that is basically leading to secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: messages and a response in the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember our active site can be is very
particular on what it's binding to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very specific shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gave the example in a lock and key model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another major function there are cell to
cell recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some glycoproteins serve as identification
tags that are specific to recognize by
[SPEAKER_00]: other cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very important in the immune
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to know what cells are self and
what cells are foreign.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these glycoproteins are very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just highlighting one right here for cell
recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cells can recognize other cells for
binding purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be for attacking purposes to
recognize what self versus something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not self might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fifth one along those same lines are
intercellular joining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Membrane proteins of adjacent cells may
hook together in various kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: junctions such as gap or tight junctions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can help allow cells to closer
communicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can also can allow for easier exchange of
materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this intercellular joining is another
major function of our membrane proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sixth attachment of the cytoskeleton and
extracellular matrix which is abbreviated
[SPEAKER_00]: ECM on some occasions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These microfilaments and other elements of
cytoskeleton may be bonded to membrane
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our microfilaments here of the
cytoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our proteins kind of binding and
holding everything together here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This function helps maintain cell shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stabilizes the location of certain
membrane proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we want our proteins to be able
to move through the fluid mosaic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times we want them fixed in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can help maintain them in
specific locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proteins adhere to the ECM.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can coordinate extracellular and
intercellular changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember ECM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm referring to extracellular matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of shows just a graphical
representation of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the six major functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember to go back to that beginning
slide here and to just review and to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand a little bit about each of the
six.
Thank you.
