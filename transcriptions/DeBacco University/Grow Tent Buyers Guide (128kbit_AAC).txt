[SPEAKER_00]: So you look to purchase a Grotent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks for coming to Tobacco
University to get some information and a
[SPEAKER_00]: buyer's guide looking at Grotent so you
can find the one that's the best fit for
[SPEAKER_00]: your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's compare some Grotents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get an idea which one will fit
your situation the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, there's many Grotents out
there and for the comparison, I decided
[SPEAKER_00]: here to compare all Grotents of the four
foot by two foot size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good entry level, fits in a lot of areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just the one I've chosen to
keep the size the same for all the tents
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to investigate here on this
buyer's guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start here with the convert,
the two foot by four foot Grotent you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Key features, it does have a metal frame
with reinforced corner connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages to this tent is as many
access ports with center viewing windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can clearly see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the downfall is that it does have
one large door flap that can be awkward
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the traditional centerline
zippers to try to access your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you'll have to be doing hopefully on
a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the sun hut, big and easy
that we can see indicated right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Key features, a large access door in the
back of the tent, which in addition to
[SPEAKER_00]: that large center zipper we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pros are that it's a full four by two
feet of growing space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall is it's slightly larger
outside measurements can make going
[SPEAKER_00]: through doorways a little bit more
challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does give you a two foot by four
foot growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind when looking at
dimensions, measure your doorway,
[SPEAKER_00]: measure your closet and have an idea not
just what the growing space is with the
[SPEAKER_00]: full outer dimensions are to make sure it
will fit in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to some of the more common
brand names, brand name, if you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Gorilla Grotent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the light line and this has an
optional height extension for an
[SPEAKER_00]: additional cost, but that is kind of a key
feature to this line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have a full metal frame and
connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which are always great to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medium canvas density compared to others
in the Grotent lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like your entry level type
of material there, but still the Gorilla
[SPEAKER_00]: Tent name brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to the shorty and this design
for areas with limited head space where
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have a kind of a short ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full metal framing connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, traditional of the Gorilla Tents we
see here and it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cons though are the middle of the pack
in the Grotent lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like not the entry level,
it's also not their more expensive model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of that mid level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're kind of getting not quite as
good as the top of the line, but a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of proof the lower line is kind of
caught in that middle there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That upper end one, that kind of that top
of the line they say of the Gorilla Tent
[SPEAKER_00]: would be the heavy duty one and that's
considered to be the kind of highest
[SPEAKER_00]: strength and durability of the Gorilla
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have that full metal framing
connections as we've seen throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is the most expensive
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that you're really
looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you justify some of the options that
it provides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Justify that additional cost?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it offer advantages to you of the
strength and durability compared to that
[SPEAKER_00]: light line we saw very first?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you're just going to put a
Grotent in an area and just kind of take
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in and out, not a lot of
transitions back and forth, that can have
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of wear on the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: That light line may be sufficient or at
least offer a good entry level there for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this kind of offered you some
examples of some Grotents you may have
[SPEAKER_00]: been looking at, may not have considered
so you can make an educated decision in
[SPEAKER_00]: your purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
