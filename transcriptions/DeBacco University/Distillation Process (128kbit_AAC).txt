[SPEAKER_00]: So when I have a title that says the
distillation process we might be thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: of distillation such as an alcohol here
with like a moonshine copper still or the
[SPEAKER_00]: distillation process here where we're
taking Heated crude oil and producing
[SPEAKER_00]: gasoline or diesel oil or fuel oil and
while these two steps are part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: distillation process And it's basically
separating substances out based on
[SPEAKER_00]: different boiling points.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to relate this to distilling
or purifying water So the distillation of
[SPEAKER_00]: water results from boiling water into
vapor and condensing it back into a liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this boiling doesn't necessarily
need to always occur we can simply
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporate water and Condense it into
clouds and then have it rain and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets into our rivers and streams and lakes
and then gets evaporate again This is a
[SPEAKER_00]: natural process of the water cycle So the
distillation process while we can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: speed it along with boiling of water and
turn it into vapor This is a natural
[SPEAKER_00]: occurrence that occurs as part of the
water cycle Now typically when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the apparatus required to form
distilled water typically takes a high
[SPEAKER_00]: energy input There's a lot of heat
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see what the copper stills a lot
of temperature monitoring even here on a
[SPEAKER_00]: lab a lot of Energy required to heat that
water to boil in as a result now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take a lot of energy It's not a
very fast process but the advantage it
[SPEAKER_00]: does produce as close to pure water as
just about any system out there So this is
[SPEAKER_00]: important to keep in mind if you're really
trying to do a distillation process Trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to get that pure H2O this distillation
process would be one worth Considering to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to get that close to pure water as
possible in removing any potential
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminants and impurities You You
