[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at the unique
properties of water, which is probably a
[SPEAKER_00]: substance you take for granted to what's
going on at the molecular level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into a little bit about
what's going on here with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we're probably familiar with the
solid, liquid, and gaseous form of water,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're pretty much at one atmosphere of
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this is showing here is pressure
and temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at one atmosphere, we know water
freezes at zero degrees Celsius,
[SPEAKER_00]: and its boiling point is 100 degrees
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can see if we change the
pressure, we will shift that boiling point
[SPEAKER_00]: and where that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snowflakes are these unique crystalline
structures of water here, familiar with if
[SPEAKER_00]: you live in a climate that has cold
weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's kind of the basic properties
that's going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's important to remember that
water is what we call a polar molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a water molecule, two hydrogen atoms
form a single polar covalent bonds with
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen atom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives water more structure than other
liquids, because oxygen is more
[SPEAKER_00]: electronegative.
[SPEAKER_00]: The region around this oxygen has a
partial negative charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because those electronegativity is
pulling those electrons closer to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, electrons have a negative
charge, so here's our partial negative
[SPEAKER_00]: charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The region near the two hydrogen atoms has
a partial positive charge, and we see that
[SPEAKER_00]: depicted here also.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because there's electrons being
pulled away, creating a negative charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're creating a slightly positive
charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important, because this is what
allows water to form what we call hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This holds the molecule together,
and each water molecule can form a maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: of four hydrogen bonds, because we have to
think of the three-dimensional structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hydrogen bonds joining water molecules
are weak, only about one-twentieth as
[SPEAKER_00]: strong as covalent bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they form, they break, they reform with
great frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see here, the hydrogen bonds are
represented by a dashed line, or the
[SPEAKER_00]: covalent bonds by a solid dark line,
indicating that the covalent bonds are
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger than the weaker hydrogen bonds
that are breaking and reforming quite
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cohesion is important in plants,
so hydrogen bonds holds the substance
[SPEAKER_00]: together, a phenomenon called cohesion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cohesion among water molecules plays a key
role in the transport of water against
[SPEAKER_00]: gravitating plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about plants, we get into
capillary action.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of the molecular structure
that allows that to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, our dashed lines here represent
hydrogen bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a partial positive binding to a
partial negative charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to break and reform at a
continual rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we kind of remember and compare
cohesion and adhesion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, adhesion is the clinging of one
substance to another, which contributes to
[SPEAKER_00]: as water adheres to the walls of the
vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adhesion, I want you to think of like
an adhesive, like a tape, tape sticking to
[SPEAKER_00]: the wall, tape sticking to a desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's water binding to
something other than water, water to a
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here with the needles of the
tree, water clinging to that leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the property of adhesion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cohesion is water binding to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's holding this droplet together is
cohesion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's water molecules binding to other
water molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see that in action with our spider
web here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water is adhering to the web material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it's adhering to the plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it's adhering to the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cohesive properties are the waters,
again, water molecules binding the water
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules through hydrogen bonds,
causing the little tiny water molecules or
[SPEAKER_00]: droplets to form here, here, and here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surface tension, what causes that droplet
to form?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's surface tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a measure of the force necessary
to stretch or break the surface of a
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's related to cohesion, the cohesive
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water has a greater surface tension than
most other liquids because hydrogen bonds
[SPEAKER_00]: among surface water molecules resist
stretching or breaking at the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what allows this water droplet to
form and maintain a very spherical shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may think of surface tension as like
water bugs because some animals can stand,
[SPEAKER_00]: walk, or run on water without breaking the
surface tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water strider here, the little water
bug that we might see run across the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface, or the basculous lizard where it
kind of uses its large webbed feet and the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface tension of water to kind of skim
and run right across the water surface
[SPEAKER_00]: away from predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch this YouTube video to see some of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, water is also important because it
moderates the temperature on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water stabilizes air temperature by
absorbing heat from warmer air and
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing heat to cooler air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water can absorb or release relatively
large amounts of heat with only a slight
[SPEAKER_00]: change in its own temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going through August, September,
October, November, December.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the northern hemisphere being
cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: But water is helping moderate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are monthly mean temperatures,
again, Celsius and Fahrenheit converted
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's helping moderate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a very unique property of being
able to stabilize heat sources because it
[SPEAKER_00]: can absorb or release large amounts of
heat energy with only a slight change in
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual water temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this specific heat concept is the
amount of heat that must be absorbed or
[SPEAKER_00]: lost for one gram of the substance to
change its temperature by one degree
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 71% of the earth is covered by
water, and water served as a large heat
[SPEAKER_00]: sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is responsible for the prevention of
temperature fluctuations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know that if you go down near the
coast in the summertime, it typically will
[SPEAKER_00]: be cooler because that water is kind of
providing that heat sink, that cooler
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coastal areas having this milder climate
tend to have less extremes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a very stable marine environment takes
a lot of energy, a lot of heat over an
[SPEAKER_00]: extended period of time to change a large
body of water, particularly the ocean or
[SPEAKER_00]: estuaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where is earth's water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you look at the first one here,
the total global water, 96.5% is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 2.5% is fresh water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some other saline water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of this 2.5%, so this little blue region
here, if we look at that closer,
[SPEAKER_00]: we expand that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the fresh water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within this 2.5%, 68.7% is locked up in
glaciers and ice caps.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little over 30% is in ground water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some other surface in fresh water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at this little 1.2% of surface
and other fresh water and expand that out,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of that's ground ice or permafrost,
about 69%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lakes wake up another 20.9%.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see soil moisture, swamps,
rivers, other living things in the
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere, how that breaks apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here is a zoom in of this 2.5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this area here, the surface water and
other fresh water is a zoom in this 1.2%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuning on, evaporative cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cooling of the surface occurs when the
liquid evaporates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's responsible for monitoring Earth's
climate, stabilizing temperature in
[SPEAKER_00]: aquatic ecosystems, and preventing
organisms from overheating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be familiar with that in the hot
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be these cooling centers,
this high mist area.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that evaporates, it's taking away the
heat and giving you that cooling effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Density to water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is actually most dense at 4 degrees
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it freezes at 0 degrees
Celsius, it's most dense at 4 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contracts until that 4 degrees,
and it will actually expand or get larger
[SPEAKER_00]: from 4 degrees to 0 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here's our temperature at 0
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our density, maximum density again
at 4 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why if you go over a bridge you
might see this is because the road surface
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to expand and contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, just like water, it's going
to expand and contract at different
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they put this to allow that surface to
expand and contract without buckling the
[SPEAKER_00]: asphalt here or damaging the bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Density to water?
[SPEAKER_00]: It prevents water from freezing from the
bottom up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important that frozen water is
less dense to allow it to float because
[SPEAKER_00]: this allows ice to form at the surface
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: The freezing of water releases heat to the
water below, creating an insulating
[SPEAKER_00]: factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes transition between seasons less
abrupt when we have this area here frozen
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows us to kind of have a more normal
transition from the winter months to the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer months or the spring that will
slowly, ideally warm up over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The structure of ice?
[SPEAKER_00]: When water reaches 0 degrees Celsius,
water becomes locked into a crystal
[SPEAKER_00]: lattice with each molecule bonded to the
maximum of 4 partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ice is actually about 10% less dense than
water at 4 degrees, and this crystalline
[SPEAKER_00]: structure that's forming that we see here,
we see a lot of air pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why ice is less dense than 4
degrees Celsius water, and this is why ice
[SPEAKER_00]: floats.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is less dense than 4 degrees Celsius
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water is this solvent for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, a solution is composed of a
solute and a solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, the solute, this could be table
sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the solute, and this is the minor
component in the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, the solvent is the substance that
dissolves the solute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically a liquid, but can be a solid or
a gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it is a liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This creates here, once this dissolves,
an aqueous solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: An aqueous solution is saying that the
solvent is water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aqueous would be referring to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of just a solution,
this would be an aqueous solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're looking at the solvent,
the substance that dissolves the solute
[SPEAKER_00]: being water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, comparing hydrophilic with
hydrophobic, hydrophilic likes water,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these are ionic compounds that
dissolve in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polar molecules, for the most part,
are water soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrophobic is kind of scared of dislikes
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are non-polar compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our hydrophobic dislikes water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that this is trying to repel,
creating this kind of large bubble effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the substance here is hydrophilic,
meaning it likes water, you'll see it kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of spread out and form this sheet here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cuticle of plants is typically made
of wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you see the beading of these
water droplets occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this gives you some appreciation
for the unique properties of water.
