[SPEAKER_00]: So how do physical body barriers relate to
the immune system?
[SPEAKER_00]: And more specifically, how do the three
images I included here relate to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the reason why I've put these images
here is to see if you can make connections
[SPEAKER_00]: between typically non-traditional immune
system pictures to see how they do relate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physical body barriers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the fence here is representing that
physical barrier, such as our skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shoe stepping and gum here,
that sticky substance, is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: represent the mucus, which is important
for trapping potential invading
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bottle here of the unknown kind of
acid poison is going to represent our
[SPEAKER_00]: stomach acid, a way we can chemically
combat invaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more specifically, securing our
borders, that first line of the fence,
[SPEAKER_00]: that skin, those mucus membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may remember keratin in the skin,
component of our hair, acts as a very
[SPEAKER_00]: strong physical barrier to most
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also resistant to weak acids and
bases, bacterial enzymes, and toxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this keratin is a very strong substance
and acts as a great physical barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, we have our mucus,
which if you've ever been a little sick
[SPEAKER_00]: and sneezed, you may notice this kind of
sticky, Latin-ish kind of material that's
[SPEAKER_00]: called mucus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it provides similar protection to
mechanical barriers, coats the hairs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and traps inhaled particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also part of the upper respiratory
tract that's affiliated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they sweep dust particles from the
lower respiratory passages.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of sticky substance acts as a
way of trapping some of these invading
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms that we may take in and breathe
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sticky substance, just as we feel it
sticky, is what's trapping those organisms
[SPEAKER_00]: that can then be swept up through and
ultimately digested in the stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the stomach itself has its own line of
defense, and that produces chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly, we have acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our skin is slightly acidic at 3 to 5
pH, and that is able to inhibit bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that our digestive tract,
such as our stomach, can be hydrochloric
[SPEAKER_00]: acid, producing very low pH, sometimes
right around the pH of 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sebum earwax contains chemicals also
toxic to bacteria, saliva, tears also
[SPEAKER_00]: contains lice designs, mucus traps
microorganisms, enter the digestive and
[SPEAKER_00]: respiratory systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could see many of these,
our body has a lot of these physical ways
[SPEAKER_00]: to combat potential invaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
