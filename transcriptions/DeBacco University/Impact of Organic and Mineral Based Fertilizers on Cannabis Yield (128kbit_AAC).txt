[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBacco University video,
I'm going to go over the impact of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: and mineral-based fertilizers in relation
to cannabis yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so I know there's some great
debate between organic and mineral-based
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers, so let's take a look at it
from a scientific viewpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, here is the research article.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanted to dive into the information
a little more in detail, I provide the
[SPEAKER_00]: proper citation right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you my take on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, there were two liquid
fertilizer types.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was the organic and the mineral
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both were prepared in order to contain the
same concentration of macronutrients based
[SPEAKER_00]: on manufacturer-provided information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Macronutrients are nitrogen, phosphorus,
potassium, calcium, magnesium,
[SPEAKER_00]: were the main focus of the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: No signs or symptoms of micronutrient
deficiencies or toxicities were observed
[SPEAKER_00]: between the organic and mineral
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to know all the details of the
fertilizer concentrations, the pHs,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ECs, the solutions, and the
compositions and ratios of the fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions, it's all provided here for you
to take a look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, take a message in order to
provide the same concentration of
[SPEAKER_00]: macronutrients despite being organic or
mineral.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, fertilizer concentrations and the
general sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the concentrations were 80 milligrams
per liter, 160 milligrams per liter,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 240.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilizer treatments were applied in
liquid solution twice per week starting at
[SPEAKER_00]: day 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see table two, which is
located right here for more details.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's days after planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants did not receive any further
fertilization during the last week of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can kind of see the days here,
the cultivation week, the fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: solution, the cumulative solution amounts,
and then the concentrations at 80,
[SPEAKER_00]: 160, and 240.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all broken down right there for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, plant sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was done here in this study was that
two harvests during the stage at 22 and
[SPEAKER_00]: day 36, days after planting, four harvests
during the flowering stage at days 54,
[SPEAKER_00]: 69, 83, and 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: At each harvest, four plants per
treatment, one plant per treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a replicant were cut at the base and
separated into three bacterial sections,
[SPEAKER_00]: stems, leaves, and in fluorescence there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is kind of the breakdown of
basically how this study was conducted.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at plant comparisons at
day 36 and day 99, how did they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: look?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here's our fertilizer concentration
for organic on the top row and mineral on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at day 36 and then day
99, which is the harvest, just so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see some visual comparisons there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's the end of the veg stage,
and this is basically the harvest there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can do some visual comparisons if
you want between those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, looking at the flower comparisons,
we're looking at day 99 of harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants were defoliated to show only the
inflorescence just before flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can see that located in the image
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at the source of
variation, we're looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus,
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at those different contents there,
we could see just kind of how we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at breaking those down here from a
kind of table standpoint, but also from a
[SPEAKER_00]: visual standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into some more what this
research actually did show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, looking at the vegetative plant
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was not affected by the type of
fertilizer as indicated by similar values
[SPEAKER_00]: of leaf area and specific leaf area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, looking at kind of our data table
right over here, when you see NS,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically no significant difference there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant dry matter, which is A, increased
steadily over time for both fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marginal differences shown between day 22
and day 66.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can kind of see that, day 69,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that from here to basically day
69 right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, plant dry matter, we're seeing very
marginal differences, but not really
[SPEAKER_00]: anything too significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get to B, okay,
down here for leaf area per plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the interaction of fertilizer type and
days after planting was not significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilizer type was significant with
larger leaf area for the mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments compared to the organic
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, by a slight margin here when you
see those different letters, and organic
[SPEAKER_00]: is the green bars and mineral is the black
and white bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no significant difference
between fertilizer types were found for a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific leaf area, and that's looking
again at letter C here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decreasing trend from day 69, days after
planting, to a range between 282.3 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 214.2 centimeters squared per gram there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the least squared means, and all the
little information here about what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing in these graphs is provided right
here just to give you a little bit of an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea, but we're looking at that kind of
veg to flowering is flipping between day
[SPEAKER_00]: 36 and day 54, and we could see
differences in trends located here during
[SPEAKER_00]: the vegetative part.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the plants actually look like,
well, this is a kind of a late harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf sample at day 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves from the different canopy positions
illustrated for the factors, fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: type, which is vertical, and then
fertilizer concentration, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: horizontal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the low end of the fertilizer,
the 80, the 160, and the 240, and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: see organic in the top row and mineral
here in the bottom row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that there was some tip run at the
higher fertilizer concentrations,
[SPEAKER_00]: so just keep note of that, that there are
some toxicity symptoms as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the yield difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, final yield differences, A,
was mainly attributed to at least two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks before harvest when the mineral
fertilization had significantly higher
[SPEAKER_00]: inflorescence dry matter than organic
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD yield, differences between fertilizer
types was lower due to lower CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration with mineral fertilization,
indicating a possible dilution effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the last two weeks before harvest,
influence dry matter strongly increased
[SPEAKER_00]: and kinematics were accumulated,
for part C here, presenting a large sink
[SPEAKER_00]: with high assimilate nutrient demand
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we see the same coloration
difference between organic and mineral,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's referring to no significant
difference there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, nitrogen forms, so you need to keep
in mind that one main difference among
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen forms and fertilizer types is
that organic fertilizers contain higher
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios of the ammonia and the nitrates
than mineral fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when we're looking at our comparison,
the type of nitrogen plays a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ammoniums and those nitrates versus
those nitrites is going to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: different in how those potentially can be
absorbed by the plant and what the odds
[SPEAKER_00]: are of them leaching or denitrifying
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, just keep that in mind that the
organic fertilizer contains higher rates
[SPEAKER_00]: of the ammonium and the NO3 or the nitrate
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, NPK levels in the leaves compared to
flowers, so kind of an interesting kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation here, blue representing the
lower, green, the mid, and red the higher
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilization rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen is easily mobile in the plant
tissue, which can be observed by the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of curves of accumulation,
depletion within nitrogen levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus is also a mobile nutrient here,
we can see that right here, but movement
[SPEAKER_00]: in the leaves to flowers was not clear
really as visible as it was for nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All treatments reached a plateau for
phosphorus around day 69.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the final harvest, plants of the 80,
60, and 240 accumulated 41.9, 49.7,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 59 milligrams of phosphorus per plant
in the leaves respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus content and inflorescence was
up 4.2 times higher than the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the flowers compared to the leaves
where that's accumulating is definitely an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting factor there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is looking at the leaf column
and then the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The accumulation of potassium was similar
to phosphorus, only exception plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: the lowest fertilizer concentration,
80, reached their plateau earlier at day
[SPEAKER_00]: 69.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, little nice comparison here
between what's happening in the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to what's happening in the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're looking at phosphorous
fertilization, in this study, no
[SPEAKER_00]: significant differences between fertilizer
concentrations were found for phosphorous
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations and the inflorescence at
the final harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pea concentration in leaves, stems,
and substrate were significantly higher
[SPEAKER_00]: for the highest treatment, indicating
overall fertilization with phosphorus at
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintaining high nutrient levels in leaves
and substrates is not relevant at the
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is important for consideration
that we really want to be mindful of how
[SPEAKER_00]: much fertilizer we're adding because it
could lead to negative effects or really
[SPEAKER_00]: just increased cost with no increased
benefit in the end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, mineral fertilization generally shows
higher nutrient uptake and agronomic use
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiencies compared to organic
treatments, mainly because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately available and it's not really
needs to be broken down by anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, keep this in mind that this is an
important consideration when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing these fertilizer types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those organic fertilizers, significantly
lower plant and inflorescence in dry
[SPEAKER_00]: matter, leaf area, and finally,
CBD yield of organic treatments are
[SPEAKER_00]: supported by the general lower nitrogen
uptake efficiency, especially in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks, which is a major sink stage
where that nutrients are potentially going
[SPEAKER_00]: to that flower compared to those mineral
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it did kind of wane or did kind of
struggle those last two weeks there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if using organic fertilizers,
you should be applied earlier and
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially at higher rates than mineral
components to be available during those
[SPEAKER_00]: final two weeks of flowering when the sink
demand for inflorescence is very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to meet those demands and because
minerals are available so quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can meet those demands and the plant
can uptake it right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because organics need a little breakdown
time to be absorbed by the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: applying a little bit more, especially
paying attention to those final two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: right before harvest, could be important
to maintain quality yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the best of both worlds, you know,
a higher availability of mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers can be important for plant
initial growth, while organic fertilizers
[SPEAKER_00]: can be employed as a more suitable,
sustainable nutrient complement during the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering stage without major yield
losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of playing to the strengths of
both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using mineral fertilizers for that quick
kind of available and using organic
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers for that longer, more
sustained growth offer the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, take home message here when looking
at fertilizer concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fertilizer concentration of 160
produced 95% of the CBD yield compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: the highest rate, which is 240,
while receiving one-third less nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you can get 95% of the yield with a
third less nutrient nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can really help the profitability
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can really help, you know,
maximizing yields by minimizing inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, organic fertilizer usage,
if you're going to be using this source,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you may have to add more on
someone else using mineral-based
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers because of the lower nutrient
uptake efficiency, so you have to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nutrient acquisition was lower for
organic fertilizer during the final two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks before harvest, resulting in reduced
biomass and CBD yield compared to mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're looking at phosphorus
fertilizer here, nothing against any of
[SPEAKER_00]: these, but be mindful of the amount of
phosphorus that you're adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fertilizer rate for phosphorus can be
generally reduced during the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering to avoid unproductive nutrient
accumulation in the vegetative plant
[SPEAKER_00]: organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's especially mindful if you're
using these very high bloom-based
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers that have 50, 55, 45%
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants don't need as much phosphorus as
many growers have been led to believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this study continues to prove that,
showing that it doesn't really help the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does accumulate in the stems and the
leaves, but those typically are plant
[SPEAKER_00]: parts that growers are not really looking
at harvesting or receiving any benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, cut down on your phosphorus
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can help reduce your chance at
environmental contamination, reduce your
[SPEAKER_00]: cost, and still maintain the same yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
