[SPEAKER_00]: While there's sadly many insects that can
infect and be of pest to tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to touch on four of the
major highlights here, hornworms,
[SPEAKER_00]: whiteflies, aphids, and cutworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with hornworms, what to look
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you want to see small to large green
caterpillars eating tomato leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some people have an eye for them and
they can spot them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people will struggle to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, despite their large size,
they can blend in quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to cheat and find them,
you can inspect your plants at night with
[SPEAKER_00]: a black light as hornworms will glow.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you find a hornworm that has
these white little pill-like structures
[SPEAKER_00]: attached to it, you want to leave those be
because that's been infected by a natural
[SPEAKER_00]: parasite, and that parasite will then
produce offspring that will be able to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and hunt down and destroy other
hornworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was fortunate to see one actually in
the act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a wasp infecting this hornworm here
that will then soon turn into this that
[SPEAKER_00]: will then cause it to go through and
produce more parasites to infect other
[SPEAKER_00]: hornworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you see one that looks like
this, you want to remove it and crush it
[SPEAKER_00]: and kill it and feed it to chickens to
basically prevent it from eating your
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you prevent these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, insect netting is one way to add a
physical barrier or to simple control and
[SPEAKER_00]: remove them, the non-parasitized
hornworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whiteflies are small flies that are white,
so that's kind of where they get their
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Reflective mulches can help deter them and
how to control them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many times, controls are not needed,
as I've seen heavily infested tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: plants with minimal reduction in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biological control weapons are available,
such as green lace wings, big-eyed bugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and minute-prevent bugs can be ways to
help combat these on an insect-to-insect
[SPEAKER_00]: combat level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids are very small, and they can be
black, tan, white, or almost clear specks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll almost see like a tannish-yellowish
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're typically bigger concern from
August on, that later portion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're inspecting an area and you
see a lot of bumblebees in the area,
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of void of any flowers,
it's likely to have an aphid's feeding on
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf structure, releasing this sugary
sap that the bees will feed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, reflective weed block or insect
netting would be an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be very difficult to control,
despite their small size and behind
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garlic-based sprays can help repel them,
and biological control, such as green lace
[SPEAKER_00]: wings, can also help reduce their numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, you can look at cutworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're caterpillars feeding on seedlings
that recently planted in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: They literally cut the plants down,
clean fields well at the end of the season
[SPEAKER_00]: to the previous growing year, color plants
with either a physical barrier,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as a paper club or dichotomous earth,
or a diatomaceous earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two ways you can add a physical
barrier if you're known to have cutworms
[SPEAKER_00]: in a particular planting site.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to till the soil at least
two weeks before planting, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil will help expose these cutworms to
the surface, and hopefully reduce their
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
