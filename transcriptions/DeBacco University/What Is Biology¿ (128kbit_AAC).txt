[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, in this video I tend to at least
address the question, what is biology?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of students know it as the study of
life, but then to go much beyond that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where a lot of them get tripped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with biology, study of life,
study of living things is a way also to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And living things can be classified into
six kingdoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably most familiar with
animals, plants, maybe even fungi and
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, but there's also protists and
archaea.
[SPEAKER_00]: As part of the total of the six kingdoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, well, what is life?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like the game of life,
like cereal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's kind of humorous here with the egg
and the chicken crawling out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do we actually define what
actually is life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've concluded two links to some
videos here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of give you an appreciation for
what life is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one is duck egg hatching under
time-lapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one is a monarch butterfly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting back to this central question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since biology is the study of life,
we need to think about, well, what does
[SPEAKER_00]: life mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it mean to be alive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we look at a cell here and we have
individual components, the cilia,
[SPEAKER_00]: the microtubules, the Golgi apparatus,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the individual components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have these individual components
are organized to result in a behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: So alone, the Golgi apparatus the lysomes,
the cytoplasm, the cell membrane are just
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of these combined together result
in a behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And components are organized into this
specific structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So living organisms and many nonliving
things share three properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: They typically provide movement and they
respond to stimulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's getting into that behavior
component there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we say our properties of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's five main properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: All living organisms share these five
basic properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is cellular organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: All organisms are composed of at least one
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be just one cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here cells composed of atoms,
molecules, macromolecules, cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cells can combine to form tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tissues can combine to form organs,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the key or the five basic
properties is cellular organization and
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that all living organisms are
composed of at least one cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another is that these living organisms
have metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's metabolism?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, all living organisms use energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here we're taking in this case,
chemical energy in the form of
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrates, fats, proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be producing chemical
waste, carbon dioxide, producing heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: forming ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's resulting in our metabolism,
the ability to use and break down energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the organisms are able to maintain
homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are stable internal conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite wanting to change, such as blood
sugar here being increased or decreased,
[SPEAKER_00]: the body's trying to maintain a relatively
stable environment despite a changing
[SPEAKER_00]: external environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be walking from a room that is
air conditioned, where it's very cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: walking outside to where it's very hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your body's trying to maintain the same
temperature despite the changing external
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four is all living organisms can grow and
reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here, whether it's human,
whether it's insect, able to grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduce even though the life cycles of
each individual may be different,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is that cycle that does occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, all living organisms possess
genetic material that is based on DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we're able to inherit certain
genes from our mom or our dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's through the pass down of the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're able to track that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes us essentially who we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting those all together, if you didn't
get them all there at once, this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: last summary slide that all living
organisms have cellular organization,
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism, homeostasis, growth,
and reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, all organisms have some form of
heredity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this is helpful in describing
the properties of life.
Thank you.
Thank you.
