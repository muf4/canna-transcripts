[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, looking here at endocytosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gonna be looking at taking things into the
cell and how it goes about doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the process may differ depending on
what particles the cell might be taking
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under endocytosis, it's basically the
plasma membrane envelops small particles
[SPEAKER_00]: or fluid, then seals itself in the form of
a vesicle or vacuole which enters the
[SPEAKER_00]: cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see right here there's three different
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phagocytosis, penocytosis, and
receptor-mediated endocytosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick image of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phagocytosis here, penocytosis here,
receptor-mediated endocytosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about each in a little bit more
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with phagocytosis, kind of what
this little image shows here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell it in gulso particle by wrapping
around it, packaging it within the
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane, and classifying it as a vacuole.
[SPEAKER_00]: The particle is digested after the vacuole
fuses with a lysome containing hydrolytic
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically we're taking something in,
sealing it off, and in this case
[SPEAKER_00]: destroying it or adding enzymes to help
break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is being an example of phagocytosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another example of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this bacterium being taken in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our vacuole essentially here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our little vesicle being formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our lysome is binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: These little green things represent little
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that's being added here to the
phagolysomes and then we're breaking that
[SPEAKER_00]: cell apart and we're getting rid of the
debris.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be something to think about for
like white blood cells taking in foreign
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria and helping destroy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of the process that they go
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Penocytosis may look initially the same
where we're having the membrane pinch and
[SPEAKER_00]: forming these vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, with penocytosis, think of the
cell gulping droplets of extracellular
[SPEAKER_00]: fluid into the vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit more water and
ion-containing water step.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the fluid itself that is needed
by the cell, but the molecules dissolved
[SPEAKER_00]: in the droplet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while this taking in water,
it's really not the water per se that the
[SPEAKER_00]: cell needs, it's what's dissolved in the
water that the cell needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because any and all included solutes are
taken into the cell, penocytosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: remember, is nonspecific in the substances
it transports.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's here, just kind of grabbed here,
instead of grabbing a star item,
[SPEAKER_00]: it grabbed a little blue box and a blue
box was formed in the vesicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of pinched itself and took
what was near it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the example of penocytosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, very specific is
receptor-mediated endocytosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This enables the cell to require bulk
clonings of specific substances,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though those substances may not be
very concentrated extracellular fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's only a couple molecules
floating around the cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor-mediated will allow those
molecules to enter the cell, because as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as it bumps into one of these
receptors, it binds to it, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna initiate cellular processes to help
take that into the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Embedded in the membrane are proteins with
specific receptor sites exposed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: extracellular surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our little blue protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's binding specifically to this red
triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The receptor proteins are usually already
clustered in regions in the membrane
[SPEAKER_00]: called coded pits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which are aligned with their cytoplasmic
side by a fuzzulator of coat proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this means is that here's our protein
exposed to the extracellular fluid,
[SPEAKER_00]: the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: This red triangle is binding to this blue
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it's very specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else is not gonna bind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It binds and it allows it to be taken into
the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Receptor-mediated, it needs a very
specific site or reception in order for
[SPEAKER_00]: this to be taken into the cell through the
process of endocytosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exocytosis is the exact opposite of
endocytosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If endo is taking in, exo is leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this process, the membrane of the
vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane and
[SPEAKER_00]: its contents are released to the outer
portions of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our vesicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's binding now to the plasma membrane,
and instead of sealing it up, it's now
[SPEAKER_00]: simply opening up, spilling the contents
out to the extracellular fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the example of exocytosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good video to watch that helps
explain and goes over this process a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, endocytosis has three forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phagocytosis is taking in typically food
items or in white blood cells' case
[SPEAKER_00]: foreign bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pinnocytosis is grabbing in fluid with
ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really the cells looking for the
ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Receptor-mediated is specific binding
sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And exocytosis is just the opposite of
this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are butting off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, our Golgi apparatus is butting
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And leaving the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be hormones, they could be
signals, or it could be waste products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, exocytosis is exiting,
endo is being taken into the cell.
Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
