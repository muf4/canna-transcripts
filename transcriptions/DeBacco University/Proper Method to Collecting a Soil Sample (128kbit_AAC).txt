[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times you talk about taking a
soil sample and sending it off to the lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: now that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes it's forgotten about the
proper method about going about when
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting that soil sample and the
importance of following a proper method so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can send something accurate to the
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why this is so important is the
lab is only as good as a sample you
[SPEAKER_00]: provide them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your responsibility to follow the
proper sample technique to ensure the
[SPEAKER_00]: results the lab provides are
representative of your field conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lab is going to test the soil that you
send them and give you results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your goal is to make sure that's
representative of your field so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: results that they give you can be applied
to your exact particular situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how to properly correct the soil
sample?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's kind of a few different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use kind of a simple way.
[SPEAKER_00]: My step one is to collect something you
can core the soil with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically a 16 inch piece of inch and a
half PVC pipe works great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easily found.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's inert so again this is a great tool
to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I take a five gallon pail you may
need to add a plastic bag to ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no contamination depending what
that pail was used for previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a clean bag so you're getting a
clean sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a large hammer for pounding the PVC
pipe into the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a PVC pipe, I got a five gallon
pail which usually has a bag liner and I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a large hammer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step two is to mark gradations on that PVC
pipe so you know where six, eight,
[SPEAKER_00]: ten, maybe even 12 inches are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your goal is to get a soil sample of six
to eight inches deep depending on the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: type you may want to go deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of have six as that minimum if
you hit a rock or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can get down to six to maybe nine
inches that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to go much over 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step three we walk randomly over your
growing area taking about a dozen or so
[SPEAKER_00]: cores or samples that we place in your
five gallon pail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to avoid potential biases such as
corners, edges, or areas of uneven
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole point here is you want that
representative sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to just walk from one
corner right down the line take all your
[SPEAKER_00]: cores this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of want to take one maybe from
the middle, one over here, one over here,
[SPEAKER_00]: come back around, take some over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of gives you that random kind of
sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to typically avoid corners
because they may get over or under
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilized and they may not be
representative of the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to just avoid taking them all in
one straight line here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That nice random sample is going to
provide you with the most field
[SPEAKER_00]: representative results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now after you have all those cores you
want to mix up your sample in the pail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to take a sub sample of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sub sample should be about couple of
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to send them like a really
small kind of thimble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to send that full cup there
because it's going to allow them to
[SPEAKER_00]: perform the test that they need in an
accurate manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step five, which is probably the most
annoying of all the steps sometimes,
[SPEAKER_00]: is to fill out the appropriate paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Label the bags with your sample,
the title, as well as your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mail it to the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: One hint if you are mailing a lot of
samples to the lab you might consider flat
[SPEAKER_00]: rate boxes because if it fits it ships and
soil can be very heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get charged by the weight that
can increase your cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're shipping a lot they can fit into
one of the flat rate boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be an advantageous and cost
effective way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when filling out your paperwork though
you want to be sure that there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: test options typically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one's best for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically you could look at what they
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you don't want to go up to
cheapest or all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to look at what's going to fit
your conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to give you the most amount,
not of information, just the most amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of useful information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with determining why you're testing
your sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any background on the area?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just looking for the general
nutrient profile, just the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking for soluble salts, organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again there's a lot of options there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When in doubt you can always contact the
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just in general you're looking at
typically that standard soil test will
[SPEAKER_00]: give you great base information and then
there's typically more details available
[SPEAKER_00]: from there.
