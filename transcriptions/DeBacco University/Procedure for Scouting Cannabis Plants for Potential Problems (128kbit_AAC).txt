[SPEAKER_00]: Many times you hear the importance of
scouting your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well here I want to go through on this
Tobacco University video, provide you with
[SPEAKER_00]: the procedure to how properly to go about
scouting your cannabis plants for any
[SPEAKER_00]: potential problems so you can catch them
early and implement control measures
[SPEAKER_00]: before the problem gets out of hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over the procedure for
scouting cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, know what the normal looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an important very first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should your plants look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: This pertains to the obvious above ground
portions of the plant, but do not also
[SPEAKER_00]: forget about the below ground portions of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may say, oh yeah, the leaves need to
be green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some cultivars, some varieties might
have a lighter green coloration,
[SPEAKER_00]: might have more anthocyanins, more purple
coloration, so just keep in mind to know
[SPEAKER_00]: what the normal for your particular plant
that you're growing, what it looks like,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you know if things are outside of what
the normal is expected to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, know what is common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and this is before you go and
inspect, know what you're likely to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep an open eye, but there can be some
expected issues as plants age and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: particular growing environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you're late in the season,
in the fall, outdoor growing, or even
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor growing, powdery mildew might be of
increased odds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, things to consider of know what to
expect, but also expect, as always,
[SPEAKER_00]: the unexpected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know what is hot this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, every year there's a
certain disease or an insect that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: very prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly for outdoor locations,
try to get an idea what others might be
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing, as this will help provide some
hints on what you should be especially on
[SPEAKER_00]: the lookout for that particular year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell people at the end of the year,
I can always tell you what we should have
[SPEAKER_00]: been looking out for, but each year there
always seems like there's something that
[SPEAKER_00]: is hot that year, something that is really
prevalent that year, and it can be based
[SPEAKER_00]: on the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weather patterns, temperature,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this leads us to the disease triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, understanding this, you need to have
the pathogen present.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the host plant, and all three
need to interact for a period of time to
[SPEAKER_00]: get disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the pathogen could be fungus,
bacterium, or virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The environment is going to be what
conditions are favorable for disease
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a host, which is a plant that can
get sick, and then you need that disease
[SPEAKER_00]: triangle, then they all interact with one
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only have two of them, you've run
the risk of having that, but when you have
[SPEAKER_00]: all three come together, that's where you
get the full-blown disease or issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's you're trying to break the
sides of the triangle here to prevent your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants from expressing that particular
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what's some basic list of equipment
that you need to go through when you go
[SPEAKER_00]: through scouting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a map if you're inspecting large
areas or multiple fields, pen or pencil
[SPEAKER_00]: and paper to write down any notes you see,
hand lens for inspecting for potential
[SPEAKER_00]: small insects or looking at really
detailed things, pocket knife for
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially cutting into plant portions,
bags if you're going to be collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: samples, and a camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you have other equipment,
all the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, some growers are utilizing
drones for scouting very large areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a great option, but these
are kind of like the basics that you would
[SPEAKER_00]: need to ensure you can do an effective
scouting of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when you want to consider the recent
events for outdoor, you want to be looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the weather?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the weather predicted to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: That can influence what you might find.
[SPEAKER_00]: For indoor environment, know what
treatments that the plants were given and
[SPEAKER_00]: also what conditions and data loggers here
last 24 hours or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: What conditions were those plants exposed
to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're talking about scouting
patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Girls not to follow a single row,
but to get an overview of the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that can be kind of a transient kind
of look, a zigzag scouting, a diamond
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern if you've got to get back to the
same point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, just keep in mind, you don't want to
just go down one row because that might
[SPEAKER_00]: give you kind of an uneven look or kind of
a bias to your scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to evaluate the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, consider the entire group of plants as
well as individual plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only have a small number of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be quite large, but in the larger
area here, we have much more plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for any sort of patterns that you
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever some consistency is one end of
the field look different than another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go through as part of your hopefully
unbiased evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to classify the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, is it random?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are only a few plants here and there
showing whatever you're noticing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could it also be on different portions of
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, some would be at the top of these
plants, the bottom of those plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: the mid-sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is typically a sign of early insects,
but it could be other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're seeing aggregated areas,
issues found in groups or sections,
[SPEAKER_00]: pockets of similarities would be noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically associated with a soil issue or
disease and or water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excessive water instead of kind of a dry
pocket or it could be a really wet area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's typically when you see these
aggregated groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of what you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took all the plants random, which is kind
of random throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aggregated would be in little clumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's aggregated versus the
repeated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, aggregated again, could it be down a
slope?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be a little depression here,
collecting water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be aggregated to the edge of the
field?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe did a fertilizer row get missed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it repeated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it only down certain rows in a certain
area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did something happen in that particular
area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a low spot, a high spot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did the tractor want to go through and
fertilize, over-fertilize or
[SPEAKER_00]: under-fertilize this particular area?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a skip in this particular
section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, all things to be looking for,
all things to be documenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you document?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, simply by taking pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can involve a general field images as
well as individual plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Portions of interest are valuable,
but sometimes having the larger image can
[SPEAKER_00]: also be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, we take a picture of this
yellowing leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, this leaf is yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at the whole plant establishment
in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just one leaf?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just one area on one plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it not all the leaves of the same age
across all the multiple growing
[SPEAKER_00]: environments and growing sections and
growing rows?
[SPEAKER_00]: All that plays into developing an accurate
diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're not able to diagnose in the
field or want to get a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: information, sometimes collecting a sample
is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be sure to collect the clean
and early symptoms and advanced portions
[SPEAKER_00]: of plant symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that clean sample is something that
really doesn't look infected or look like
[SPEAKER_00]: it has any issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to collect a portion of that
because sometimes in the lab, they might
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to see that very early on site of
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then early symptoms, something that's not
too advanced, it hasn't really broken
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just starting where you're first able to
detect the issue and then advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms as well should be included in
your sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're collecting roots, be sure to
collect them with the soil around them for
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis in the lab because that may also
play into the material that's needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When in doubt, contact the lab as far as
what sample they want to collect for what
[SPEAKER_00]: you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you suspect to ensure that you're
sending a quality sample, so hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll get a quality result because
remember the lab is only as good as the
[SPEAKER_00]: sample you send them.
Thank you.
