[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
we're going to go over drying systems for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, looking at both the hanging
drying system that we see here,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as a rack system to give you some
of the pros and cons of each, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: show you some actual examples of cannabis
drying so you can decide what drying
[SPEAKER_00]: system is the best fit for your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into drying systems
regarding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here we're seeing a lot of hang
drying, but remember it's also rack or
[SPEAKER_00]: screen drying as another option,
and we'll see both of those mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: here, as well as going out into greenhouse
to also compare them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, just in general,
what is the reason for drying?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at kind of drying,
the goal is to produce dry flour that has
[SPEAKER_00]: improved taste and flavors when ignited
because we're not just selling kind of an
[SPEAKER_00]: end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, that will be kind of gone through
and burned in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the drying process goal is to improve
the taste and flavors of that cannabis end
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's going through the point of
ignition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the drying process just in general,
when we're looking at kind of the process
[SPEAKER_00]: as it relates to cannabis, this should be
viewed not as a race.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not kind of to dry first and get
there first.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to produce a quality end
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more about kind of the destination
and kind of getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might take a little bit longer or
might want to wait another day to ensure a
[SPEAKER_00]: quality end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the area that you'll be drying in
should be very clean and tightly climate
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's true if it's a very small area
or it's a very large area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be very clean top to bottom and
very controlled of both temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: light, air circulation, and the
all-important humidity as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's things that you should be
avoiding in the drying area?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at the drying area,
high heat and intense light can degrade
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not saying no light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's ideal, but you don't have to have
absolutely no light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have very muted light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's okay if you turn that muted light
on to go into that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be 100% solid complete
darkness, but make sure the light is
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal, low intensity, and a very short
duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want to avoid speed drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't want to just take a hair dryer
to it and speed dry because that will
[SPEAKER_00]: cause larger buds not to dry consistently,
which will lead to an inferior end
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole goal here is to produce that
quality end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the two options or the two
main options?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the rack or screen drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its advantages is that it requires minimal
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great for large volume harvests,
meaning they can be easily stacked on top
[SPEAKER_00]: of one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disadvantages, it does create flat
spots in the buds and does usually require
[SPEAKER_00]: some pruning to be done ahead of time
because that reduced space, you have
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced plant materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now comparing it to the other system,
we can see right here, we call it the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant hanging system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this example, there's minimal prep
of the plant material ahead of drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes it advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantage is that it does
take up more space because that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material is a greater volume of that
simple plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can have increased odds of
contaminants developing, such as mold,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, simply because you have so
much more material.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both can produce a quality end
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind that the end
product should not really be based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: system of drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to be a little bit more careful
with the hanging system simply because it
[SPEAKER_00]: has more plant volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you've learned about these
systems, let's go into kind of a drying
[SPEAKER_00]: area situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at where we're going to see
some plants hanging, some plants drying on
[SPEAKER_00]: a rack or screen method to give you in
kind of a real world kind of example of
[SPEAKER_00]: both of these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can ensure that you're selecting
the one that is the best fit for your
[SPEAKER_00]: given situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at the all important
drying process for cannabis harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see the large branches have
been cut down and hung upside down on a
[SPEAKER_00]: wire.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light relatively is minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a air circulation on the bottom
behind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a fan blowing to,
again, help air moving throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: under canopy here of the drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helping control humidity allows this to
dry down very evenly and very
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to have like wet spots or
areas of trapping moisture because that
[SPEAKER_00]: could lead potentially to disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure we're having this
all be consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one way we see here that it
can be achieved.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we can see the drying process in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the fan blowing and we're seeing
kind of a little pathway, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: important for people to be able to walk
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also seeing the importance of
the ability for air to circulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a little dehumidifier there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are seeing some lights on, which of
course, is important to be able to walk
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, these are muted lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: This image here, again, is showing the
importance of that barrier under the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not want to have your plants
directly touching the ground there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a couple are getting some natural
sunlight and that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that all those fan leaves
have been removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire plants have been cut down and
there's that area of space below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also see the area of space above
because you want to have even air
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation around the entire plant
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to just have it at the
bottom, just at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be mindful of all of those
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we're looking at the branches here,
we can see many of those large fan leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: have been removed, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really aids in the drying down process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on the ground there, we're also seeing
some tarpings and plastic that helps,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, trap any leaves that are falling
down as well as maintain a humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen that here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking kind of from the opposite end,
looking down, seeing a very consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest, seeing a lot of repetition,
very important to allow that efficient air
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation, efficient hanging,
and efficient takedown process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see some pink tags and some string that
can label different varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: something of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making sure we have a method of
labeling and knowing when we harvested,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we harvested and what day is all
important documentation steps that should
[SPEAKER_00]: be taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing here it's a very early drying
process, but we are seeing it is initiated
[SPEAKER_00]: so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like it's going pretty well here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So monitoring is another important
component.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that we're setting
everything up ahead of time, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: monitoring that and making sure at least
everything is going in generally to plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have different forms of drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see a lot of the dry product right
here on screens, all kind of taken down
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the field, put here in a protected
greenhouse environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there's some benches.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're allowing some air circulation below.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are actually also on screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, help that airflow overall and
allow that nice, even, consistently dry
[SPEAKER_00]: down of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organized, not overly full in any one
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this just helps that drying
process to be very even, very efficient,
[SPEAKER_00]: to allow ultimately for the best product
to be produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as we look going down this aisle here
of all the different cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material drying, it is important that it
is segregated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be from different lots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be different forms of grinding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be different initial starting
materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do see that they all are on screens and
the screens are on benches and those
[SPEAKER_00]: benches are elevated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are taking advantage of some of the sun
here in this section of the greenhouse to
[SPEAKER_00]: help, again, aid in the drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll notice that there are some tarps in
the background, some shadier locations
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're having the plants that are
actually hung to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this area, we are looking at the
improved improvement of utilizing the sun,
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing that air circulation to be able
to take full advantage of every portion of
[SPEAKER_00]: the greenhouse environmental conditions
that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at a drying process
where we have all the kind of hemp plants
[SPEAKER_00]: here hung upside down for a lot of air
circulation down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is allowing for a very efficient
and very consistent dry down of the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see this goes on for quite a
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about half an acre of total plants
that have been harvested here and
[SPEAKER_00]: initially dried down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see it's being done here in a
very controlled manner so that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting very consistent harvest and very
consistent yields off everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is definitely an important part of
the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're taking a look at the drying
process, look at the actual dried product,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can see it's very consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have to deal with some
variability naturally with the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're looking at the drying process,
keeping that humidity, keeping the light
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping that air circulation going,
preventing moisture from building up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they all kind of come together,
we can get a nice consistent product that
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking our way down the greenhouse,
we can see that the tabletop benches are
[SPEAKER_00]: being used with some of the branches here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going through and drying them down,
pruning a lot of the leaves off,
[SPEAKER_00]: removing that, putting them on the
benches.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the vast majority here,
the most efficient method is hanging those
[SPEAKER_00]: branches on the wire that's been strung on
this greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: On both sides we have kind of a light,
blocking the tarps so we're not getting
[SPEAKER_00]: full intense light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also helping reduce the amount of
heat that we get in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those fans running behind me here,
they can keep air moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's also important to be sure that
we're not letting air get stagnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want moisture to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very important, especially at
the sunrise and sunset times during this
[SPEAKER_00]: fall time of year, to bring that moisture
from building up within the structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: because ultimately that could lead to
increased chance of getting bud rot,
[SPEAKER_00]: molds developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have this, much material it
could spread very quickly if you allow it
[SPEAKER_00]: to initially get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here, as we walk down the aisle,
we can see very clearly the organization
[SPEAKER_00]: of all those plants hanging above us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the hanging method being utilized,
but we're also noticing on the bench tops,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're seeing kind of like a rack system
also being utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important kind of to maximize the
space that you have and kind of ran out of
[SPEAKER_00]: space to hang the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not use the natural bench space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking here, these are a little further
along that we saw in the early part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: video.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see, again, those fan leaves
are evenly removed, allowing for those
[SPEAKER_00]: buds even air circulation and really helps
that drying process in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also notice that for the most part,
while we are in a greenhouse, we are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to minimize some of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the background there, we can see
that there's definitely some black plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: and tarps up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also noticing and probably hearing a
little bit of fan moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, air circulation is important and
that's a key factor there to be
[SPEAKER_00]: considerate, especially when you're in a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes those vents can open and close,
but we really want to make sure we're
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing air to always be moving through
those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, just kind of the end
product of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are getting that fan moving,
it might be a little bit annoying to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely does help the overall
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not heavily blowing on the plants,
but again, keeping that air moving,
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping that humidity from building up in
any one location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, lastly, something we do want to
consider as we are removing buds from the
[SPEAKER_00]: branches is the disposal of the leftover
plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis plants do tend to produce kind of
stalks that are kind of woody in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to be mindful of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be having a plan that we're
going to have to dispose of these at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the harvest cycle when we take the
valuable buds off the plants and get those
[SPEAKER_00]: dried down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this was helpful and your
welcome to sketch any other videos here on
[SPEAKER_00]: Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
