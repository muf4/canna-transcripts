[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to sorting cannabis,
some buds are just destined for
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to provide you with a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more detail on buds that go into this
particular category.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at sorting cannabis
buds destined for extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so in this case, buds for
extraction, the goal is not to focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: high quality looking flower, since the end
product will essentially be the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: the extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not looking so much at the
aesthetics of the actual bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more common for outdoor production
simply because the buds produced tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: be more variable and not visually as
appealing as those with indoor operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially, we might be going through
and selecting out maybe the high grade
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mid grade, we could potentially go either
way, but low grade typically is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be for extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're basing that on the visual aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't kind of look like
they're going to be that high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: looking or high quality aesthetics,
then a lot of times those buds will go
[SPEAKER_00]: into the category to be extracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why would you go through extraction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in mass production situations for
extraction, there is less need for the
[SPEAKER_00]: time consuming art of trimming to make
those buds look as good as they possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also be important if you're
looking to produce certain compounds and
[SPEAKER_00]: not a final showy dry flower as an end
product, looking for a certain terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile, certain terpenes specifically,
or just a cannabinoid extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no sense in kind of going through
the delicate process of producing the dry
[SPEAKER_00]: flower if you're looking at really
isolating that particular compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you'd go through this
extraction process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, as a grower, you need to know what
you can produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a process dialed in,
the odds of producing high quality dry
[SPEAKER_00]: flower are greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if this would be a struggle,
then extraction might be the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know the quality of buds that
you're going to produce are not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be that great visually looking,
not going to be that kind of super A
[SPEAKER_00]: grade, you might want to go through and
just have a plan to go through the process
[SPEAKER_00]: of extraction to produce that end product
that way instead of a final dry flower
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at targeting a compound
while extraction will be able to remove
[SPEAKER_00]: individual components, you may want to try
and target one and select a variety or
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar that is known to produce high
amounts of that material to maximize the
[SPEAKER_00]: extract concentrate that you look at
producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the extracts, again, can have some
variable as you're looking at dry flower
[SPEAKER_00]: being the bud, going to raw oil,
refined, distillate, or isolate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see the different levels here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a certain end product that you're
really looking at trying to determine,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what I want to produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, try to pick a cultivar, try to pick
a variety that is known to produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit higher value of that particular
goal product in the sense that the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: growing process, ideally, you'll get more
yield on your end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get more investment simply because
you'll have a greater amount of extract in
[SPEAKER_00]: the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where it comes in, not looking at
producing that high quality visual looking
[SPEAKER_00]: dry flower, looking at producing high
quality chemicals and components within
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
Thank you.
