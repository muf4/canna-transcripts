[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at DNA methylation here,
looking at the attachment of a methyl
[SPEAKER_00]: group, which is a CH3 component to a base
pair of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it takes on many different
shapes here, but methylation is referring
[SPEAKER_00]: to the attachment of this methyl group.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we call methylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a methylated DNA molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA methylation is important for
regulating gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is its main purpose here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no change in the sequence,
which is an important aspect to keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind here, that we're not changing the
sequence, but we're still having a way of
[SPEAKER_00]: regulating gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can that be used to prevent genes from
being expressed?
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at these methyl groups being
attached here and indicated by these kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of glowing areas on the DNA molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during gamete genesis, certain genes
are methylated and tagged as either
[SPEAKER_00]: maternal or paternal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does your body know which one comes
from mom, which one comes from dad?
[SPEAKER_00]: It can in some way relate to the amount of
methylation that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Developing embryos read these tags and
express one version over the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genes that can be expressed,
here's our promoter region, indicated gene
[SPEAKER_00]: can be expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our methyl groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Methyl groups can cause genes to be
inactivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, there's nothing wrong here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no mutations that occurred,
but they're inactivated because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: methyl groups attached here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of messing up that promoter region,
not allowing those genes to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So methylation typically found in what's
called CPG islands.
[SPEAKER_00]: C and G should be familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are cytosine and guanine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these cytosine and guanine rich areas
are located upstream of the promoter
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: For promoter region, here's our CPG
islands, CPG islands.
[SPEAKER_00]: The P indicates it's a phosphodiester
bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in humans, methylation is the result of
DNA methyltransferase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's an enzyme attaching these
methyl groups that's responsible for the
[SPEAKER_00]: initial pattern during early development
and for copying the pattern during DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only does this occur initially,
it can also be replicated when DNA goes
[SPEAKER_00]: through that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our methyl groups typically
represented by these dark circles are
[SPEAKER_00]: unmethylated groups by these open circles
or these white kind of circles here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this phosphodiester bond, not to get
into too much detail, but what this is,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's between the nucleotides here,
which presents thiamine in two molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: of adenine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our thiamine and here's our two
molecules of adenine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This phosphodiester bond is what we're
looking at right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: PO for the negative three.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we can see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our thiamine and two molecules of adenine
is our phosphodiester bond that's
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, clone mice with different DNA
methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genetically identical individuals can
look or behave very differently based on
[SPEAKER_00]: the methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, it's affecting the gene
expression, not the sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have our two mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look slightly different, but if you
look at the tails, there's definitely a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in the tails.
[SPEAKER_00]: See a nice normal tail here and this one
looks like it got run over or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is because of the methyl groups
located in the tail region of this mouse
[SPEAKER_00]: are altering the gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So DNA methylation and probe design.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after a bisulfide treatment,
which is just a scientific treatment here,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to determine what was
methylated, what was not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The methyl group will protect the
cytosine, otherwise would be converted to
[SPEAKER_00]: uracil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this methyl group, when you have this
bisulfide treatment, what's happening with
[SPEAKER_00]: cytosine, it would be converted to uracil
under normal conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That methyl group, you know, it's being
like a block.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like preventing that bisulfide
treatment from changing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, cytosine is conserved after
the treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you would add a probe and you would
see if it would bind in light.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of the methylated probe,
that G is gonna bind with that C
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating, oh, light's gonna be giving
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case if it was unmethylated,
if this unmethylated probe was added,
[SPEAKER_00]: see this has nothing to bind to,
this A is not gonna bind to that C,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just gonna be floating around.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it binds and again,
the original strain here was unmethylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this methylation probe design is a way
to determine, through a bisulfide
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment, whether or not these methyl
groups were present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if it was present, it's gonna
prevent that cytosine from being changed
[SPEAKER_00]: to a uracil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the result of a typical
bisulfide treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That methyl group will block that and
prevent that from occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a probe here to determine and
indicate whether that was present or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they call it COBRA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Combined Bisulfide Restriction Analysis is
all it stands for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically used in microbiology labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a test to determine DNA methylation
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Short, general explanation in following
terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: PCR, which we'll learn about in another
video, is a quick way to multiply DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: segments and restriction enzymes cut DNA
at very specific locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we have our groups here with the
little M's, the bisulfide treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The C's stay C's because the methyl groups
blocks that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use our restriction enzyme
digestion and it breaks, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: the DNA sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it's unprotected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those methyl groups are not present.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the bisulfide treatment,
those C's are converted to U's,
[SPEAKER_00]: which then are transferred to T's in DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a restriction enzyme that
will not recognize a particular sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this COBRA, you may have heard this
term, COBRA's Combined Bisulfide
[SPEAKER_00]: Restriction Analysis is how we determine
the DNA methylation levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is used for is comparing
normal cells to cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And notice the cancer cells have elevated
these levels of methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's methylated cancer, that's not
the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Methylation levels are typically increased
in cancer cells here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's evident.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see our cancer cells, a lot more
peaks of methylation levels than our
[SPEAKER_00]: normal cells here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just one way methylation can help
change or regulate gene expression,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically located upstream of a promoter
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
