[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at genetic
engineering related to medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: and particularly with vaccines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genetic engineering in medicine,
creating magic bullets, if you may have
[SPEAKER_00]: heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's what it's called to,
oh, we just fix the genes, you can fix the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: One example of that sort of pertaining to
this is in diabetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body is unable to control levels of
sugar because of lack of insulin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a healthy individual,
a pancreas-producing insulin, when sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: is present, allowing sugar to get put into
cells and regulating blood glucose levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, diabetes can be cured if the body
is supplied with insulin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in certain cases of diabetes,
just not producing the insulin,
[SPEAKER_00]: then glucose is left outside, not getting
into the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we just supply insulin, we kind of
create this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens is the gene encoding for
insulin has been introduced into bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: through recombinant DNA and able to get
back bacteria to produce human insulin
[SPEAKER_00]: that can then be added to patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can kind of re-correct,
particularly the type 1 diabetes,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're having insulin not being
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as a refresher, type 2 diabetes is
where insulin is produced, but it lacks an
[SPEAKER_00]: insulin receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a slightly different case,
where just adding more insulin to this
[SPEAKER_00]: case, not necessarily going to cause a fix
to this problem because it's a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: with the receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, genetic engineering related to
vaccines.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of an important one and this
is a great way to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a virus and we're developing a
vaccine against that virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, antibiotics that we may take
kill things, biotic things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, viruses really aren't alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're simply this kind of protein coat
wrapped around a DNA or RNA fragment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the influence of virus, I want you to
think of as a full house, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Brick, mortar, windows, doors,
foundation, roof, and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: An inactivated vaccine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one type of vaccine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where they basically take the
house and make it into rubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take the house and they knock it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take the flu virus, in this case,
we'll use this as an example, and they
[SPEAKER_00]: denature it in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may heat shock it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different enzymes they might add.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some ways, they're basically
inactivating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, because it's rubble, it's the
house, it's the entire flu basic virus
[SPEAKER_00]: just inactivated in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: What genetic engineering is doing is
they're going one step further than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's called a subunit vaccine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where they're just using bricks
because we want the body to recognize the
[SPEAKER_00]: virus, but we don't want the body to be at
threat for getting the virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the problems with
inactivated vaccines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subunits just bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really make the house out of
just bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make certain components of the
house, but not the full house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, subunit vaccines are
often made from isolated influenza surface
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the surface proteins are the important
parts to cell to cell recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have heard of H1N1,
H3N2.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are referring to some of the coat
proteins to particular viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to think of the bricks as
subunits.
[SPEAKER_00]: These subunit vaccines don't contain
broken viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only contain the surface protein of
parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The immune system builds a response to the
coat proteins, which it would recognize
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives protection against the whole
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning once we have the coat proteins
recognized, the body's immune system then
[SPEAKER_00]: can attack the virus very early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage of just having the coat
proteins is that there's no actual DNA or
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA virus contained there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way the body can actually get
sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are getting the advantage of a
vaccine because we're building up the
[SPEAKER_00]: body's immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just gives you a little bit of idea
of how viruses are labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be pretty complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this subunit vaccine, which I want to
focus on, there's advantages and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantages with anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But genetic engineering has allowed us to
create these subunit vaccines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't contain any live components
and are considered very safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the advantage is there's no live
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no risk of introducing a disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we tried to heat kill a virus and we
didn't heat kill it all the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could be infecting the individual with
that virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Safer, more stable than live, intuited
vaccines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are ones that are heat killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disadvantages, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a perfect world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exact combination of those surface
proteins must be correctly identified to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow the immune system to have an
effective response against future
[SPEAKER_00]: potential infections.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also no guarantee memory will form
for long-distance future responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, this is why you have to get the
flu vaccine every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The subunit vaccines don't have quite the
longevity of actually getting infected
[SPEAKER_00]: with the main virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the short-term advantage is it
may get you through flu season or reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: at least the symptoms that you may get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a novel kind of vaccine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just having the surface proteins,
just the subunits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not having any of the interior disease
vectoring components.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DNA vaccine is just plasma vectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It elicits a cellular immune response
rather than an antibody production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're not getting antibody
production, that's why we're not getting
[SPEAKER_00]: the super long-term effects here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are getting short-term effects,
again, for gifts through that flu season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot safer because rather than
introducing that whole virus live or
[SPEAKER_00]: inactivated to the immune system,
the subunit can contain those fragmented
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens and essentially gets the
effective appropriate immune response.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you a little bit, again,
of the detail of what goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very complex process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, instead of getting infected
with the flu strain by having just the
[SPEAKER_00]: coat proteins, adding those to the body
and getting the body to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition for those, it can then attack
if the real virus comes in a lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a way that for certain flus that are
very virulent, avian flu you may have
[SPEAKER_00]: heard, how the vaccine was developed by
the reverse genetics technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, those coat proteins are so
important and that's how it gets its name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking those non-virulent portions,
adding them to cultures and getting those
[SPEAKER_00]: in a certain vaccine, we get the body to
recognize and identify with a potential
[SPEAKER_00]: very virulent flu without any risk to the
individual contracting the actual flu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is no DNA or RNA encoded,
just the coat proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
