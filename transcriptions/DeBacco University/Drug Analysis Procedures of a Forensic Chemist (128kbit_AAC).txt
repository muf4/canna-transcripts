[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be looking at drug analysis
procedures for a forensics chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the specifics, some of the
options that might be used, a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the lab-based settings and
procedures that would be used to analyze
[SPEAKER_00]: different drugs brought into the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with, in order to get that
material in the lab, it first needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So collecting that material that you're
going to send to the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: While individual labs may have specific
handling procedures, the following is
[SPEAKER_00]: intended to provide a basic overview of
the drug analysis procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on the very specific type of
drug, depending on the type of lab you
[SPEAKER_00]: might be going to, there might be greater
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is meant to provide a general guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So step one is to determine the amount of
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: More is not necessarily always better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evidence submitted can vary widely in the
amount that's collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by finding the total mass of the
material, this can determine what tests
[SPEAKER_00]: can be and cannot be done due to the
amount of material there is to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where in doubt, try to collect this
quote much as you can within reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that may limit the amount of steps
that can be done or procedures carried
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this isn't always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that you're only
collecting the isolation of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have other contaminants
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why more is not always better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the amount that you can collect will
limit or potentially determine what tests
[SPEAKER_00]: will be carried out from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, you might do a presumptive
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the goal of screening out the
material to classify into a general
[SPEAKER_00]: category, common perceptive test,
microscopic analysis, micro crystal
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis, and ultraviolet spectrometry,
as well as some in-field test kits if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at specific drugs that are
typically commonly found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking here, we have the microscope
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a visual inspection of the general
structure of the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to provide a broad
classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, it's used for larger materials,
such as plant material, because it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: really great at getting at some of the
molecular structures, just more what does
[SPEAKER_00]: it look like under high-power
magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can also lead us to micro crystal
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this involves dissolving a small
amount of material and then allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: crystals to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viewing the crystals with the aid of
polarized light can help determine their
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can help classify, again,
that material and acts as another step in
[SPEAKER_00]: that analysis process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mentioned ultraviolet spectrometry,
where we're projecting ultraviolet light,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is that 380 nanometers of wavelength
of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And measuring the absorbance can help
provide a general classification of that
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to react more to the UV light
than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also an easy light source to
carry around and to be used and projected
[SPEAKER_00]: in a laboratory setting as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into what we call confirmatory
tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are used to identify the
material and often continue where a
[SPEAKER_00]: presentive test left off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The presentive test will give us a general
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the confirmatory test will tell
us exactly what it is, or that's at least
[SPEAKER_00]: the intention, is to use or develop a
chemical signature and then match that up
[SPEAKER_00]: with a particular type of substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one example that might be used here
is called gas chromatography, or GCs is
[SPEAKER_00]: very commonly used in a laboratory
settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that gas chromatography is
a type of chromatography used to analyze
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry for separating out and analyzing
compounds that can be vaporized without
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where that presentive test
might come into play, because this might
[SPEAKER_00]: lead you to use, if you have available,
gas chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used typically in forensic analysis
with the main use for testing bodily
[SPEAKER_00]: fluids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The use of the GC includes testing the
purity of a particular substance or
[SPEAKER_00]: separating out different components of a
mixture, which is the relative amount such
[SPEAKER_00]: as components can be determined,
so how much contaminants might be there,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is the purity of the substance
detected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gas chromatography can also be used to
identify a compound or residues from
[SPEAKER_00]: explosives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, has multiple uses and is a very
common method used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have something called liquid
chromatography, which operates around the
[SPEAKER_00]: same basic idea as gas chromatography,
except this is a technique used to
[SPEAKER_00]: separate samples into its individual
components based on their interactions of
[SPEAKER_00]: the sample with a mobile and stationary
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: May have done separation on a very basic
scale, like, for example, inks of pens or,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, plant material separating out
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are examples of liquid
chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have capillary electrophoresis,
or abbreviated CE, and this is an
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical technique that separates ions,
which are neutral substances that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: affected, so keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It separates these ions based on their
electrophoretic mobility and used in
[SPEAKER_00]: applied voltage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we simply have to have a charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because neutral substances will
not be affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need like a slightly positive or
slightly negative charge here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This mobility will depend on the charge of
that molecule in addition to the viscosity
[SPEAKER_00]: and the atom's radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capillary electrophoresis is used
predominantly because it gives fast
[SPEAKER_00]: results and provide higher resolution
separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a useful technique based on there's a
large range of detection methods
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some specifics here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rate at which the particles move is
proportional to the applied electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: field, so this can allow for greater
separation based on the field strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: If two ions are of the same size,
one with a greater charge will move
[SPEAKER_00]: faster, so it allows a greater degree or
specificity of separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for ions with the same charge,
the smaller particle has less friction and
[SPEAKER_00]: they have a faster migration rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what allows this to have a very
high degree of separation even if some
[SPEAKER_00]: properties are similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lab equipment used for this compound
identification process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only two covered here, but the goal is the
same with the ability to identify specific
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds being tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each requires specific protocols to be
followed in addition to proper setup and
[SPEAKER_00]: maintenance of the material, the equipment
over a period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the mass spectrometry,
and this is an analytical method that
[SPEAKER_00]: employs ionizations and mass analysis of
the compounds in order to determine the
[SPEAKER_00]: mass formula and the structure of the
compound being analyzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see also this is another highly
specific process that allows those
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds to be more precisely identified
that cannot be done in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, we have infrared
spectrometry, which is analysis using
[SPEAKER_00]: infrared light interacting with a
molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can be analyzed in three ways by
measuring absorption, emission,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also reflection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main use of this technique is in
organic and inorganic chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used by chemists to determine the
functional groups in molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, another great laboratory-based
test to get at specifically identifying
[SPEAKER_00]: the compounds in the substance that is
initially brought into the lab.
