[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen is very important to add to
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Tobacco University, we're going to
go through some chemical forms of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer that you may want to be
considering.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into chemical
nitrogen fertilizer options for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's many different types of
nitrogen fertilizer, but I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: cover urea, ammonium nitrate, and calcium
nitrate, the three we see pictured right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, starting with urea,
is it contains 100% of this chemical,
[SPEAKER_00]: which converts to ammonia in several days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the important part,
is that it's a very quick conversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also very potent because it's 46%
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see that comparing with
some of the other nitrogen sources,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you're definitely comparing it to
organic sources, this is one of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient-dense forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hydroscopic, means it does retain
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite soluble in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And water, which is a great property to
have, and also has very good handling
[SPEAKER_00]: properties as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all great considerations in
why urea can be used on such a large
[SPEAKER_00]: scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, it is used in the warmer
periods of the year, and ideally should be
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporated or in some way get into the
soil profile because it is possible for
[SPEAKER_00]: some of this nitrogen to be lost through
the process of volatilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have ammonium nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a 50% blend of two different
types of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also hydroscopic, which means it's
highly soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is explosive if mixed with
hydrocarbons, which is a fuel oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, 94% ammonium nitrate and 6%
fuel oil is basically anpho, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: highly explosive.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, most of the ammonium nitrate
fertilizer that you're purchasing is
[SPEAKER_00]: coated in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That reduces its chance of being highly
explosive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though care does need to be taken to
prevent caking, which is kind of all
[SPEAKER_00]: piling up and sticking to one another and
becoming just a solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we've got calcium nitrate,
our last one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is also highly water-soluble,
strongly hydroscopic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a tendency to absorb water and
cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does provide a readily soluble
available forms of calcium ions as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're kind of getting the benefit
there of also fertilizing your plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, this is only 15% nitrogen,
so that may play into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically this is used when soils tend
to be a little bit colder, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: early on in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be a great option to have
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: In case your plants are showing any sort
of deficiency, going through and adding
[SPEAKER_00]: some calcium nitrate can really make them
green up really quickly and forego any
[SPEAKER_00]: negative effects from a nitrogen
deficiency.
