[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm going to go over some fertilizer
requirements for squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, whether you're organic or buying
commercial fertilizer, it's important
[SPEAKER_00]: always to get a soil test for your fields
and use that as a gauge for initial
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's two fertilizer classes
you should have on hand if you are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one would be early in the
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up until flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a nitrogen source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a calcium nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great initial source, especially
when the soils are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urea, which needs to be incorporated into
the soil because if it's not, it will
[SPEAKER_00]: volatilize and you'll lose a lot of the
nitrogen to the atmosphere, or blood meal
[SPEAKER_00]: for organic restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have a hard time justifyingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: About $1.50 per pound they're charging for
blood meal when these other nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: sources will work just fine also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than nitrogen, you should get a
potassium for fruit fill.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be post flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfate of potassium, 0050 is a low-salt
potassium fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also potassium nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a need for some residual
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good source, but rarely do you
need to be adding both nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium, especially late in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, take a soil test to get the
exact amounts that you may need,
[SPEAKER_00]: but these are two good classifications of
fertilizer to have on hand if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
