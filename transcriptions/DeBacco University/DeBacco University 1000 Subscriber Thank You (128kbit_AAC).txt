[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Debaco University's 1,000
subscriber thank you here on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So subscribers tend to get names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, chosen to name subscribers
Debocuels, kind of sounds like molecules,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it goes along with the education and
scientific-based theme of the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have subscribed, thank you,
and if you have not, it's not too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: By all means, go down, click the subscribe
button, and help build this community.
[SPEAKER_00]: What subscribing means, so it may seem to
you just a click of a button, but provide
[SPEAKER_00]: a general idea of the community centered
around this channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you may not think much of it,
subscribing or not subscribing,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is much appreciated, so if you have
not, you're encouraged to take the time to
[SPEAKER_00]: go through and do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Information about the channel,
while it is educational-based,
[SPEAKER_00]: the videos tend to contain a lot of
clickbait and are probably not likely to
[SPEAKER_00]: go viral, but the intention is to provide
quality video content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Videos have been used in high schools
across the United States and also in
[SPEAKER_00]: college classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to share where you are
watching this video series and add it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the comments below, that would be great to
just see where these videos are being
[SPEAKER_00]: watched.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always encouraging to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Positive comments within the channels are
very much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good questions have been asked,
and it's creating that sense of community
[SPEAKER_00]: within the comment section, which has been
great to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going forward, in the comments below,
you may want to add what video topics you
[SPEAKER_00]: may want to see or suggestions for that,
and what you like about the channel is
[SPEAKER_00]: also encouraged to put in the comments
below, just to give that sense and kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of, again, share with those ideas amongst
other YouTube members.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, I want to close with just
telling others.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see something you'd like,
please share it and encourage others to
[SPEAKER_00]: subscribe as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to keep the channel growing,
and it's just a general thank you to those
[SPEAKER_00]: first thousand subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
