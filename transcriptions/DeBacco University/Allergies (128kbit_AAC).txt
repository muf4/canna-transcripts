[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at a very
brief overview of allergies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind, this is highly variable
based on the individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may be allergic to hair or
dander.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some may be allergic to nuts of some kind,
tree nuts or peanuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some may be allergic to pollen,
and there's a whole host of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of all have that same end result
where we have that kind of itchy eyes,
[SPEAKER_00]: running nose, and just general kind of not
feeling well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when proliferating becomes harassment,
so what are allergies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, allergies in the general sense are
when the body mounts a major defense
[SPEAKER_00]: against a harmless substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the whole point about
allergies is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have that itchy eyes, that runny
nose, that swelling, and it's this major
[SPEAKER_00]: defense despite the substance that it's
reacting to being completely harmless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hay fever and house intestimates are
examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the allergic reaction process,
mast cells initiate the inflammatory
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: They release histamine, capillary swell,
and mucus production will increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example of this too would be asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: In asthma, histamines cause a narrowing of
air passages in the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be very serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we cut off the air passages or there's
too much swelling, we can eliminate the
[SPEAKER_00]: body's ability to breathe and essentially
get air in or out of the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mast cells involve allergies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, mast cells are a main component of
the allergic response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allergies such as pollen are related to
the antibody known as IgE.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a separate video going over
antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like other antibodies, IgE antibody is
very specific and it's very important for
[SPEAKER_00]: all of our antibodies here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One acts against oak pollen, the other
acts against ragweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have that very high degree of
specificity that does occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time an allergy prone person
runs across an allergens such as ragweed
[SPEAKER_00]: here, here she makes large amounts of
ragweed IgE antibodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: These IgE molecules attach themselves to
the mast cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second time the person has a brush
with ragweed, the IgE prime mast cells
[SPEAKER_00]: release granules of powerful chemical
known as histamine and cytokines and these
[SPEAKER_00]: into the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, the chemical meteors
cause the characteristic symptoms of an
[SPEAKER_00]: allergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a prime example of the sequence of
steps that your body goes through mounting
[SPEAKER_00]: an allergic reaction to initially a piece
of ragweed pollen that really is benign
[SPEAKER_00]: and does not have any serious health
threats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the whole point of the
allergies here is your body is mounting
[SPEAKER_00]: this high end immune response for a
basically a harmless substance.
Thank you very much.
