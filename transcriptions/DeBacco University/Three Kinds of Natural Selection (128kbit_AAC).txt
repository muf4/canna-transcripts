[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to look at three
kinds of natural selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: While in general, the natural selection
process is all the same, there's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: three ways you can classify how a
population is shifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one is stabilizing selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: In humans, infants with intermediate birth
weight have the highest rate of survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you see here, we can see our birth
weight and our infant mortality is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Infant mortality decreases dramatically,
but then actually heavier babies can also
[SPEAKER_00]: be at odds for infant mortality.
[SPEAKER_00]: In chicken, eggs have intermediate weight
at the highest hatching success.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this stabilizing selection is,
is the before, it's just a normal kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: curve here, and the after has a little bit
steeper incline and that kind of more of
[SPEAKER_00]: that peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just comparing here, your percent
mortality, odds are, if you find out what
[SPEAKER_00]: you weighed when you were born,
odds are you're probably right around
[SPEAKER_00]: seven-ish pounds, a little bit more,
a little bit less.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean every individual below
two pounds dies, it just means that the
[SPEAKER_00]: likelihood of mortality is increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another type of natural selection is
called disruptive selection, where before
[SPEAKER_00]: we had this mean, and this could be kind
of like the gray rabbit here, and then all
[SPEAKER_00]: of a sudden we get this selection for two
ends of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: With bird beaks, the intermediate bird
beak could be at disadvantage,
[SPEAKER_00]: could be unable to open large seeds,
and too clumsy to open small seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that middle ground is not the
advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, you either want to be a
black rabbit or a white rabbit,
[SPEAKER_00]: the gray ones for whatever reason,
not advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just shows this disruptive
selection we're taking our mean and
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting for basically both extremes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's directional selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we're taking our mean and
we're shifting it towards the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flies that flew towards the light were
eliminated from the population,
[SPEAKER_00]: therefore the mating flies mated and the
experiment repeated for 20 generations,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're selecting for, in this case,
flies that were unattracted to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is shifting the mean entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what once was a very low percentage of
the population now becomes the mean or the
[SPEAKER_00]: average.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is directional selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the three types.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another graphical representation,
again, showing that disruptive selection
[SPEAKER_00]: are before population, and then we're
selecting for both extremes as indicated
[SPEAKER_00]: here, where, for whatever reason,
this tan is not the best color.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be a darker or lighter color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our stabilizing selection, where we're
noticing that that middle is the best or
[SPEAKER_00]: favored upon, and we're selecting against
the extremes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then directional selection,
where once our population might have been
[SPEAKER_00]: short, now we're shifting towards a taller
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where we're taking our mean and
we're shifting it towards the right.
So what once was a very low percentage of
the population now becomes the mean or
