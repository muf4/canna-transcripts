[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to give a brief
overview of light emitting plasma grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lights or LEP grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see one right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The small little jelly bean or peanut area
is where the light comes from and while
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a very small initial starting
point, it can easily cover a sufficient
[SPEAKER_00]: grow light competitive with most high
intensity discharge of lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now plasma grow lights generates a near
full spectrum of light and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly energy efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have low wattage solid state bulbs
that are in the full spectrum of light
[SPEAKER_00]: from ultraviolet to infrared and all with
no moving parts or electrodes and here is
[SPEAKER_00]: the LEP light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're similar to ceramic metal halides
that we see here just kind of on a quick
[SPEAKER_00]: visual comparison and we can clearly see
the difference between these two to a high
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure sodium light in the background of
this image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the advantages of plasma lights is
they have no basically minimal moving
[SPEAKER_00]: parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very quiet operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they're fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't dim them at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very expensive in comparison to
ceramic metal halides and the emitter
[SPEAKER_00]: which can fail over time is often not
replaced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of these reasons probably
ceramic metal halides tend to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: popular than all the benefits associated
with LEP lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
