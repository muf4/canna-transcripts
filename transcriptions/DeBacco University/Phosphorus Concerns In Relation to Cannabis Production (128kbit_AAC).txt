[SPEAKER_00]: This is something you don't hear too much
about, but looking at phosphorus concerns
[SPEAKER_00]: related to cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here on Tobacco University, we're going to
look at some of what's happening with the
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus fertilizer and how this relates
to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over some phosphorus
concerns in relation to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, phosphorus is an important
plant nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: While phosphorus is needed by plants,
growers often apply phosphorus in
[SPEAKER_00]: quantities that the plant cannot simply
consume, leading to wasting the nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these phosphorus fertilizers
become very potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This creates the potential for
environmental contamination and also
[SPEAKER_00]: increased cost with no return on
investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're contaminating the environment
and increasing your costs without
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing your yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: All negative situations there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at the some of the phosphate
mines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's limited reserves worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only seven mines in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: with the majority coming from Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the world total of nitrogen
consumption, phosphorus consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at nitrogen phosphorus again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see Asia kind of increasing the
fertilizer consumption overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are seeing this trend in increased
need for phosphorus even though worldwide
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very limiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: mined data here of phosphate rock from the
year 1900 to 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: mined phosphorus has shown a decrease
since the kind of 1980s or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many would think this would correlate with
a decrease in demand or consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this graph does not tell the full
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it is true, markable rock phosphate
in metric tons mined in the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: has been on the decrease since the 1980s.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, unless it doesn't contain the
full story, this contains a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more of that fuller picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because while U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: mined phosphorus has decreased over the
same time period, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: has gone from an exporter to an importer
of rock phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in part due to the decreased
impurity of phosphorus mines in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in 1980s we did a lot of
exporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exporting decreased and now imports are on
the increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking more phosphate in from other
countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why focus on phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a nutrient that growers tend to
over apply due to the idea that it will
[SPEAKER_00]: induce flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while important for flowering,
growers tend to over apply it,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a concern due to the potential
problems facing phosphorus in the near
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to be mindful of these super
strong potent fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to use them in very limiting
quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to just keep adding a bunch
of these because we'll be wasting that
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus, which is a very precious
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it limited resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phosphorus is a kind of non-substitial
component of all living organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This nutrient is critical element for
plant growth and as a result, also the
[SPEAKER_00]: food chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using fertilizer derived from phosphate
rock has made an increase in food
[SPEAKER_00]: production possible and reduced the
malnourishment since the mid 20th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: All very good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, recent worries about the future
shortage of phosphorus have sparked debate
[SPEAKER_00]: over the lifespan of existing reserves and
all kind of put at varying degrees of when
[SPEAKER_00]: we will actually run out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a freshwater contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phosphorus can speed up the
ectrophication, which is a reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: dissolved oxygen in freshwater bodies
caused by an increase of mineral and
[SPEAKER_00]: organic nutrients of rivers and lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil erosion is also a major contributor
of phosphorus to streams.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's not just limited to streams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an algal bloom of Lake Erie taken
from a satellite in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see all this green is where all of
the algae blooms are occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the great lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we may see it in small rivers and
ponds, it's also a concern there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also impact the large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as cannabis growers, they need to be
aware of not over adding phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be mindful of this limited resource
and to not create environmental pollutants
[SPEAKER_00]: that could affect very large scale bodies
of water.
