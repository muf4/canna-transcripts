[SPEAKER_00]: Ever wonder how to go about selecting the
correct grow tent for cannabis production?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well here at Tobacco University,
we're going to walk you through that
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, if you decided on a grow tent,
it's going to be your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go through how to choose the right
one and what to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, there's many grow tent
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to kind of realize and
that's going to be a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reason for all the options is a variety of
locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three main categories and that is
grow tent kits where you could purchase
[SPEAKER_00]: something that comes all inclusive and all
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's multi-chamber grow tents where
there's different isolated components
[SPEAKER_00]: within the general structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just a standard or single
chamber grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll walk you through those examples
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the grow tent kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's many different kits out
there, many different options,
[SPEAKER_00]: many different kind of setups to fit
different needs by different growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're ideal for someone who wants to
get started right away with a system that
[SPEAKER_00]: works and doesn't require much research or
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're often sold by the type of light
that they utilize and that can be included
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a large impact on the total
price.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there's a lot of other little pieces
of equipment, usually the light is the
[SPEAKER_00]: driving force in the main overall cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kits often include the tent itself,
a grow light, a ventilation system,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing substrate, whether it's soilless
or hydroponic, and a basic collection of
[SPEAKER_00]: general accessories that would be needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The focus here is to learn how to select a
setup that best fits your specific growing
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these kits are an option but will not
be the focus of this video because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to come all included.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, the information provided will
help you customize your own specific kit
[SPEAKER_00]: for your needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're looking at certain kits,
these are certain features you might want
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at and seek out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're ensuring you're getting one
that's going to work well for you right
[SPEAKER_00]: off the initial purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting to the multi-chambered grow
tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as the name implies, they have
multiple chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are intended for very space-limited
growers and they do offer, at least
[SPEAKER_00]: ideally, a perpetual grow harvest by being
able to isolate all different stages of
[SPEAKER_00]: the growing cycle in one tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Propagation, the vegetative stage,
and also the potential for flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some may even have a clone chamber or a
mother room as depicted right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're better suited for entry-level
growers not looking to produce total yield
[SPEAKER_00]: in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using separate tents can offer better
overall control of conditions and allow
[SPEAKER_00]: for more plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these will be what's focused on in this
series.
[SPEAKER_00]: But realize that these multi-chamber ones
do exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, though, you do still have to
light each one, have good ventilation for
[SPEAKER_00]: each one, keep them isolated so you're not
getting cross-contamination or light
[SPEAKER_00]: spillover from either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is why these multi-chamber
ones are a little bit better for your
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The standard or the single-chamber grow
tents, of course, these will be the main
[SPEAKER_00]: focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always add more tents to get
isolated conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of having them all have
multi-chambers, you can just simply have
[SPEAKER_00]: more tents and then isolate them that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a flower tent, have a veg tent,
a mother or propagation tent, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: separate them out that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where will you be putting the tent?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good question just to ask
yourself in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless, you want to measure the area,
usually at least twice, to make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't get anything wrong, and get an idea
of the natural environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you be needing to heat the area more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you need to cool the area more?
[SPEAKER_00]: What will be important to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind that if the area is a
little on the cooler side, if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be running certain lights or high
intense lights, you may be heating the
[SPEAKER_00]: area sufficiently with just the light
source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common growing locations are a large room,
a closet, garage, a shed, even an attic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are many other options even
beyond this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you want to get an idea of what
environment in general you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: putting the tent into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that then leads to the next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where a lot of growers can
figure this bigger always, but what size
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tent are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to start with the square feet of
floor space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of plants that are grown can be
dependent on pruning style and total size
[SPEAKER_00]: of each, below some general idea of the
average size plants provided as a guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're looking at a four by two tent,
you're looking at two to three plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: four by four tent, four to five,
four foot by eight foot, six to eight,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a 10 by 10, about 12 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you also want to be considering the
total height.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you're looking at the
square footage, you also want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: considerate of how tall, what type of
ceiling you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ceiling limited?
[SPEAKER_00]: How tall can you go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get a tent that's a little bit
taller, a little bit steep when it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit shorter?
[SPEAKER_00]: So other than just the square foot,
you also want to be considerate of the
[SPEAKER_00]: height of your space because that will
dictate the height of how tall the tent
[SPEAKER_00]: can be as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how tall do you go for your tent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the best center is really as tall as
you can fit in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they all look the same if you're
looking at them online or in pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure the tallest they can
fit in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for this is it will allow for
more light hanging adjustment options.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants can be bigger if you need them
to be, and there's more room for air
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some come at fixed heights, some allow
extensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, what's the best fit for your
particular area once you've measured it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when we're looking at looking up
anyway, we want to be looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: ceiling support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many grow tents have ceiling support bars
that allow for multiple options for
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging lights, filters, fans,
while also bringing structural support to
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual structure itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to see if there is good or
adequate ceiling support because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be hanging a lot typically off
this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a sign that you have a good
quality tent there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower tent vents in access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having vents on the lower side of the tent
can help ensure cool air is drawn into the
[SPEAKER_00]: crow tent if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for that passive
ventilation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the small and large access ports,
it will draw with drawstrings as we can
[SPEAKER_00]: see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a large one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a small one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those drawstrings help seal the growing
air environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This not only will reduce light splash,
but also carbon dioxide links if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: leaks or if you are looking at going
through and enriching the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why you would have these in the
first place is you want access to power
[SPEAKER_00]: cords, ventilation systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these are going to be components
that you're going to want to be adding to
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you always don't want to have them
going out kind of the main zipper or the
[SPEAKER_00]: main door.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ask for a very clean and neat
installation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the upper vents, if we're looking
towards again the top of the tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: those multiple vents of different sizes
offer growers a lot more flexibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can also be a closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's no real negative,
having more at least initially need,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then initially need by the grower,
meaning here we see three vents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, I never need three vents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can simply just pull the
drawstring, see them up and no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a point in time where you do need
all three, maybe an intake, an exhaust and
[SPEAKER_00]: some power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you have that opportunity?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no real downfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're comparing two tents and
everything's equal, one of the couple more
[SPEAKER_00]: vent options here typically go with the
one as more, even if you don't initially
[SPEAKER_00]: need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll allow you to kind of be future-proof
for your structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, there are many manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ideally all serve the same function,
but there are some specifics to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for what the type of the frame
is made out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: A strong frame at that because you need to
support lights, fans, filters and many
[SPEAKER_00]: other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reflective material on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: A tear-resistant material on the outside
would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quality zipper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double floor to prevent water leaks
outside the tent because you will be
[SPEAKER_00]: watering if even if you have catch bands
as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these are worthwhile to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other videos on this channel that
will get into some of the manufacturers,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're welcome also to check that video
out here on DeBaco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
