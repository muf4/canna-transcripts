[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're looking at the animal
phylum, cnidarians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, remember here for a little how to
pronounce it, my own kind of rendition of
[SPEAKER_00]: how to pronounce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you should be familiar with these,
jellyfish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cnidaria, they're tissues that lead to
greater specialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember our sponges were now going a
little bit more advanced, still pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: primitive and simple, but we are having
tissues now being formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these animals here are radial
symmetrical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember our sponges were not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a body plan that allows them to
interact with their environment on all
[SPEAKER_00]: sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a high environmental interactions
that are occurring and it's because of
[SPEAKER_00]: their body type allows for that and the
radial symmetry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember is one of our key distinguishing
factors for being able to place the
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity of animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's different classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember phylum is the broader way of
categorizing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Classes are a little bit more specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Box jellyfish, sea anemones, true
jellyfish, fire corals are all under the
[SPEAKER_00]: same phylum, but you can see here there's
four different classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever wonder how a jellyfish kind of
reproduces?
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see them floating around in the
ocean around the beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: The life cycle of the jellyfish includes
two stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the medusa stage and then we have
the polyp stage here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The polyp actually reproduces asexually by
budding and the medusa here we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduces sexually with this permanent
egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see that life cycle that
goes around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, budding here, the polyp,
and then we have our kind of individual
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from there, originating from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: See a pretty simple organism, pretty
simple life cycle overall, but more
[SPEAKER_00]: complex than our sponges because we have
the development of tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to tissues, this allows for
greater specialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a major evolutionary advantage is
something called extracellular digestion
[SPEAKER_00]: of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now digestion begins outside the cells or
in the gut or a gastro vascular cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big advancement.
[SPEAKER_00]: This form of digestion allows animals to
digest an animal larger than itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this extracellular digestion allows it
to take in portions of food particles and
[SPEAKER_00]: break them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gastro vascular cavity we see here
located on the inner portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here shown, this is a photograph
of what it looks like, and then here is
[SPEAKER_00]: the illustration of its morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here's kind of looking,
this camera angle would be kind of from
[SPEAKER_00]: the top here looking down into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see evidence of this gastro
vascular cavity, this extracellular
[SPEAKER_00]: digestion, which is a key advancement in
our animal classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrocytes are stinging cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So jellyfish, which is why I highlight
that one in particular, is that's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: one you're most familiar with,
because you're probably told at an early
[SPEAKER_00]: age to stay away from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animals that's phylum have stinging cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these stinging cells are what gives
them the ability to collect food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now from our standpoint, we're bigger than
they are, but we get that stinging
[SPEAKER_00]: sensation of just not pleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on what type of jellyfish,
it could be deadly even to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: These nitrocytes contain large organelles
called nematocysts that are stored in the
[SPEAKER_00]: coiled thread and barb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that evidence here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When hair-like projections on the cell
surface are touched, see here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the thread or barb of the toxins are fired
from the organelle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of see here the retracted
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of think of everything kind
of being condensed in and kind of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: spring compressed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that liver is tripped, then you get
the popping there of the barb and the
[SPEAKER_00]: thread, and that's where the toxins may be
kept, and that's what's causing the
[SPEAKER_00]: stinging nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now specific to jellyfish, you want a
great video to kind of look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great link here that shows this
in slow motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So jellyfish have harpoon-like barbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a microscopic view here called a
nematocyst, which spear prey and retract
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the tentacle.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can discharge so explosively,
and they show that in the video,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's capable of piercing the hard
shell of a crab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not something to be taken
lightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely quite the punch behind
it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've actually filmed it in slow motion
on this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that smarter everyday video,
great one to check out, and it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: gets you to appreciate, even though you
may not enjoy the experience if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever been stunned by a jellyfish,
what's going on with that animal inside
[SPEAKER_00]: the tentacles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
