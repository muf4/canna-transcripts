[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're answering the question,
is it easier to hold your breath after
[SPEAKER_00]: inhalation or after exhalation,
and then hold your breath?
[SPEAKER_00]: So which one of those is it easier to hold
your breath for a longer period of time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, it's easier to hold your
breath after inhalation than after
[SPEAKER_00]: exhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever tried this, you can try it
for yourself, try inhaling and holding
[SPEAKER_00]: your breath, and exhaling and holding your
breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's important, there's a science behind
this, is that your bodies cannot detect
[SPEAKER_00]: low oxygen, but are sensitive,
actually, to high carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your brain actually uses blood carbon
dioxide as an indicator for blood oxygen,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that when your CO2 levels are too high,
you're signaled to take a breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your body is only looking at the carbon
dioxide levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking in assumption, if carbon dioxide
is high, then oxygen must be low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you find this hard to believe that
low oxygen is not what makes you breathe,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is clearly a proof of concept,
and that's carbon monoxide poisoning.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening during carbon monoxide
poisoning is all these negative factors
[SPEAKER_00]: can also be death, sadly, or coma.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why this happens is because
you're breathing air with low oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CO2 levels are actually the same in
your body, and that's what's regulating
[SPEAKER_00]: your breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your breathing is actually as normal,
even though, because your CO2 levels are
[SPEAKER_00]: normal, even though your oxygen levels are
becoming dangerously low.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically die without ever realizing
it because you're oxygen deprived.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not because of low oxygen you
start breathing more or start feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: shortness of breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, your oxygen levels are decreasing in
carbon monoxide poisoning, but because
[SPEAKER_00]: your carbon dioxide levels are remaining
normal, your body basically doesn't react.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result of that low oxygen,
you'll basically block out without any
[SPEAKER_00]: warning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The science behind the question here is
lungs full of a breath of air have high
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen concentration and low carbon
dioxide concentration, then your body
[SPEAKER_00]: does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oxygen flows into your blood and carbon
dioxide out of your blood, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: you're holding your breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, after a period of time, empty lungs
have lower volume, so fewer carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules are needed to get the same
concentration in your blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the process of diffusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thus, carbon dioxide stops leaving your
blood faster if the lungs are empty,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning carbon dioxide levels in your
blood reach critical levels faster and you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to breathe sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at this in a graphical standpoint,
this is looking at divers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's normal breathing, here's normal
breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urgent need to breathe occurs when high
carbon dioxide levels trigger breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing to do with your body
perceiving oxygen levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also notice our pH can influence the
hemoglobin binding portion there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, hemoglobin is a protein and
as a result, pH can influence its shape
[SPEAKER_00]: and its ability to bind oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly here, respiratory adjustments at
high altitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever been to high altitudes,
there's basically air is not quite as
[SPEAKER_00]: dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your body responds to quick movement to
high altitude, which is considered to be
[SPEAKER_00]: above 8,000 feet, with symptoms of acute
mountain sickness, such as headache,
[SPEAKER_00]: shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness,
all negative things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Becoming acclimated to this area,
respiratory and hematrophic adjustments
[SPEAKER_00]: include increasing ventilation,
can actually breathe more, exchange more
[SPEAKER_00]: air, supposedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you become more responsive to carbon
dioxide pressure and a substantial decline
[SPEAKER_00]: in oxygen pressure stimulates these
peripheral chemoreceptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important if you're going up to high
altitudes to adjust to this, to basically
[SPEAKER_00]: get yourself acclimated to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to not go from sea level to
14,000 feet in one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to work your way up to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, it's suggested that you start
from, if you're used to being at sea
[SPEAKER_00]: level, go up to 5,000 feet, then go above
8,000 feet, and then work your way up to
[SPEAKER_00]: 14,000 feet here at Pike's Peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the body's going to do some of these
adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to breathe a little heavier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to drink a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all ways you can try to negate
some of this mountain sickness that does
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simply occurring because your body's
reacting to simply having less air density
[SPEAKER_00]: at a high altitude than what's typically
used to at low altitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see this a lot with sports teams and
events that go to potentially Denver,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mile High Stadium, or in Mexico,
where areas are very high in elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go there up to a week before,
so they can get adjusted, their body's
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusted to that lower amount of air
density.
Thank you.
