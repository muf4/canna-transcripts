[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this Tobacco University video,
we're going to go over the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: mercine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, welcome to the terpene guide to
mercine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's the scent location and
properties of this particular terpene?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, mercine is a monoterpene found in
the most abundant terpene in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scent is earthy, sweet and musky and
foods that it might be familiar with it
[SPEAKER_00]: containing because it, of course,
occurs in more than just cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mango, hops, lemongrass, thyme,
guava, melon, as well as that lemongrass
[SPEAKER_00]: has that kind of mercine concentration,
which you might be familiar with some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the sweet, earthy, musky smells you might
be very familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the benefits of
mercine is that it does have
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammatory and anti-mutagenic,
which inhibits cell mutation, including
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer cell properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of important for reducing
inflammation as well as a potential chance
[SPEAKER_00]: at reducing cells from mutating,
which could be related to cancer research
[SPEAKER_00]: going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does suppress muscle spasms, sleep aid and
also has antibacterial properties as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Studies show that mercine may take THC
more effective, which is why it said that
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming fresh mango or other fruits that
are high in concentrations of mercine
[SPEAKER_00]: prior to consuming cannabis will increase
the effects of the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have that chance that this might be
having that effect, additive effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: with some other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, going through information,
this is one thing I did find, I did cite
[SPEAKER_00]: the source down here, is that there's
inaccurate information I've read about
[SPEAKER_00]: mercine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mercine is important, as they state,
because presence determines whether the
[SPEAKER_00]: strain is indica or sativa, and that is
not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking at classifying indica or
sativa based on the effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're saying anything with less than
0.5% mercine produces sativa-like effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that sativa and indica,
the only true indication of sativa versus
[SPEAKER_00]: indica is the morphology or how the plant
actually looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing to do with indica-like
effects, sativa-like effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica sativa is really only referring to
the morphology of how the plant looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it tall with thin leaves or is it
shorter with wider leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an indica versus sativa comparison,
not these kind of made up effects because
[SPEAKER_00]: different terpene concentrations,
cannabinoid concentrations can change the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical profile, which can change some of
the properties and effects of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica sativa, not directly correlated,
it's an old myth that goes way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking for some strains to
kind of look at that might be high in
[SPEAKER_00]: mercine, here's kind of a little bit of a
list here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's also a great summary slide to
provide you with some more information
[SPEAKER_00]: about the terpene mercine.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
