[SPEAKER_00]: With any growing operation, mistakes will
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here are some common grower errors
that I find in grow operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking a little bit more than just
kind of spilling the morning coffee on the
[SPEAKER_00]: daily news here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at some common, and I left them
listed here, grower errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, often growers do not like to
admit that they make mistakes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're allowed to make mistakes,
I don't want you to be too tentative and
[SPEAKER_00]: not do anything, but you can only make
each mistake once.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't allow for repeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you make one mistake, you want to
definitely make note of that and don't let
[SPEAKER_00]: it happen again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pruning errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pruning is often a combination of both an
art and a science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, you can only remove plant
material once.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't kind of put it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think of it almost like a haircut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always cut the hair off,
and yeah, it may grow back, but it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to take a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to decide on a pruning method
early on and stick with it for the
[SPEAKER_00]: duration of the growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be switching from one
type to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers will read up on one and
want to prune that way when they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of training the plant one way,
and that can cause some issues long range.
[SPEAKER_00]: That switching midway will reduce the
plant efficiency, make it very difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially to prune depending on what
you're changing from or to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under fertilizing, this can result from a
miscalculation, where in some cases
[SPEAKER_00]: growers simply just get cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to skimp on the total amount of
fertilizer to save on cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how much they skimp?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they go 10% off the recommended 20%?
[SPEAKER_00]: 30%, 40%, 80% off?
[SPEAKER_00]: That can kind of impact the potential on
the plant there.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, especially early in the growth
cycle, this can stunt plants, which may
[SPEAKER_00]: offset the growth cycle permanently and
damage plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, we have
over-fertilizing, and this can be a very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar plant problem as under-fertilizing
by stunting and damaging of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often this isn't regarded or thought of as
being an issue, but yes, over-fertilizing
[SPEAKER_00]: can stunt plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times over-fertilizing comes from
a miscalculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often growers think more is better,
so they add and end up doing more harm
[SPEAKER_00]: than good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the fertilizer is like an ounce to a
gallon, they may add an ounce and a
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter, ounce and a half, making a little
more insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be good for the plant,
but there is a reason why that's an
[SPEAKER_00]: optimum or ideal amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're just wasting money, and it could
potentially harm the plant or contaminate
[SPEAKER_00]: groundwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, there's also mishandling of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when moving, you want to take care and
handle those plants with care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be mindful of others that you're working
with, as you don't want to do any
[SPEAKER_00]: unnecessary harm to the branches,
as this will reduce overall yields if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're breaking branches, especially if
you're moving them from a flower room or
[SPEAKER_00]: from a bedroom to a flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be mindful of that shuffling of
plants process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also be careful of the amount of nitrogen
fertilizer you add, as this can help make
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants slightly more resilient to
damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, continually adding silicates
to the irrigation water can help
[SPEAKER_00]: strengthen the plant structure,
making them less likely to break branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, something that can't be added once
and fixed needs to be continually added
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of accumulated in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can help strengthen plants if that
does become an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically, just watch the amount of
nitrogen, and just be careful of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants as you're moving them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transplant shock, this is often a direct
result grows for trying to rush plants
[SPEAKER_00]: along the production process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different types of shock that
can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light intensity when changing the type of
light, that can cause some damage,
[SPEAKER_00]: so be mindful of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photo period, the time of light exposure,
flipping the lights can also cause a
[SPEAKER_00]: little stress on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root transplant shock, when the containers
are changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be mindful when you are changing
containers, you're trying to do it without
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbing the roots too badly,
so that you're reducing the delay or the
[SPEAKER_00]: lag time that plant may have during the
transplant process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, applicator blight, a very common
error I see in growers, and this is where
[SPEAKER_00]: growers raise the plant for a benefit,
but ends up doing more harm, or at least
[SPEAKER_00]: some harm, than just pure benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some possible causes are the wrong
dilution rate, product interactions,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to mix too many products together,
applied too hard with too much force,
[SPEAKER_00]: application made during high light
intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for outdoor application, avoid mid-day
spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: For indoor, watch mid-light spray,
or when the lights just kind of first come
[SPEAKER_00]: on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A leftover product not properly washed out
from the last use, causing potential
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So applicator blights is kind of a funny
term for the grower, kind of causing the
[SPEAKER_00]: error.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be mindful of if you are gonna be
applying something to the plants that you
[SPEAKER_00]: are sticking to all the parameters,
and not causing more damage than good to
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
