[SPEAKER_00]: So here on this Tobacco University video,
we're going to be investigating different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of evidence and how we may go about
classifying them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at two main
categories for evidence, it's important to
[SPEAKER_00]: know what category the evidence you're
collecting falls into.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, whether it's a direct or
testimonial, whether it's circumstantial,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as a physical piece of evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main broad classification of
evidence that may be collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now direct or testimonial evidence
includes firsthand observations,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as testimonies from eyewitness
accounts, written statements, confessions,
[SPEAKER_00]: or video cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testimonies may sound convincing,
but need to be cross-examined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if we get those shortly after a
crime has been committed, keep in mind
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is classified as direct
evidence or testimonial evidence,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to back that up with other
supporting data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now circumstantial or physical evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is indirect evidence that can be used
to imply a fact, but does not directly
[SPEAKER_00]: prove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It refers to any evidence that would be
present at the crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also includes items found in the
suspect's possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because it wasn't found directly
at the crime scene, it may be necessary to
[SPEAKER_00]: investigate and use that because it may
show or tie a better story to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine the full idea of what had
happened at the crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have different types of evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with these different types,
we're looking at what are some examples of
[SPEAKER_00]: circumstantial or physical evidence that
could be collected at a crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be thinking about these different types
of physical evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, something as simple as a trash can
here with all sorts of DNA, fingerprints,
[SPEAKER_00]: hair, all sorts of things can be
collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some evidence examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have blood, hair, fiber,
soil, glass, tire marks, paint chips,
[SPEAKER_00]: explosive, tool marks, firearms,
ballistics, shell casings, pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just some evidence examples that
can all be very important to a crime
[SPEAKER_00]: scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we look here, how could these types
of evidence be classified further?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have all these different types,
these fingerprints, tool marks,
[SPEAKER_00]: blood, soil, glass, tire marks,
how could we go about classifying these?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, be thinking about these are
things that could be collected at a crime
[SPEAKER_00]: scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we potentially classify them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, looking at here is just some
examples of some broad forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get that circumstantial or physical
evidence and detailed classifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have biological evidence that can
include body fluids, hair, natural fibers,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant parts, and DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some physical components that
could be like bullets or casings or
[SPEAKER_00]: artificial fibers or tool marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get into trace evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this refers to physical evidence
that's found in small but measurable
[SPEAKER_00]: quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to the investigator to not only
identify what to look for, but to also
[SPEAKER_00]: find them and collect them in a way that
preserves them so they can be used and
[SPEAKER_00]: entered as evidence for a crime scene.
