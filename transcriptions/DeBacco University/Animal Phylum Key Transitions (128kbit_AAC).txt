[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at animal
phylum and key transitions that occur,
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing us to determine which animals are
more primitive and which ones are more
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced in certain features.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at these
transitions, we're looking at transitions
[SPEAKER_00]: in the body plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're marked by these six key
points, and I'm going to go over each of
[SPEAKER_00]: these in detail, but here's the basic
overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have presence or absence of tissues,
bilateral symmetry, presence of a body
[SPEAKER_00]: cavity, segmentation, if the organism
molts, and deuterosome development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting first here, tissues is the
first key transition in the animal body
[SPEAKER_00]: plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only a pair of zoa, the sponges,
lack defined tissues and organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: All other animals have tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this lack of this kind of defined
tissue here is a key way to identify a
[SPEAKER_00]: sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: These animals exist as aggregates of cells
with minimal intercellular coordination.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means this kind of exists as
aggregates of cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's composed of cells, but aggregates
just simply means a collection of cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they're organized to some degree,
but there's minimal intercellular
[SPEAKER_00]: coordination, meaning there's minimal
specialization within all the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're each kind of all performing the
same function.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not getting very specialized,
and this is key in the C sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Further examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have bilateral symmetry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's our sponge, and we can see
there's no real symmetry there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have something called radial symmetry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now virtually all animals other than
sponges have a defined symmetry of some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radial here is the body plan in which all
parts of the body are arranged around a
[SPEAKER_00]: central axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any plane passing through the central axis
divides the organism in halves,
[SPEAKER_00]: approximating a mirror image.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is radial, forming all these radii.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bilateral symmetry, on the other hand,
is this one distinct of plane asymmetry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body plan with distinct of right and
left halves are mirror images.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plan, the bilateral symmetry,
allows for specialization among body
[SPEAKER_00]: regions and more efficient movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at just the symmetry, bilateral
symmetry would seem to be more advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: animals than radial symmetry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to put that into a little bit of a
picture here, as you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animal ancestor, asymmetry, the sponges,
very basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radial symmetry are cnidarians,
and in all these bilateral symmetry,
[SPEAKER_00]: examples of animals have distinct right
and left halves, more efficient movement,
[SPEAKER_00]: and considered more advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third key, that body cavity,
is an important step in animal evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Internal space allowed for the support of
organs, distribution of materials,
[SPEAKER_00]: and coordination of development.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just chose a picture of the human here,
because we're going to go over some body
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this does not only pertain to
humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably think of us as having a
cranial cavity, thoracic cavity,
[SPEAKER_00]: abdominal cavity, pelvic cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just one example of development of
body cavities being a key step in animal
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing there, segmentations,
subdivisions of body, which is a key
[SPEAKER_00]: transition into the animal body plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each segment can develop more or less
complete set of adult organ systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: and can be used for moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more segments an animal has,
we see here, can allow potentially for
[SPEAKER_00]: more specialization, more efficient
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we're considering to be an
advancement in the development of the body
[SPEAKER_00]: plan, versus something that's just kind of
very basic here, more segments,
[SPEAKER_00]: the chance for more specialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a cool image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molting, about a shedding process that
allows for new growth to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is cicada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in the northeast, you may hear them
in the summertime that make that really
[SPEAKER_00]: loud sound, typically in a nice,
warm, late July or August day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molting, though, is common not only for
our cicada, but for snakes and crabs and
[SPEAKER_00]: scorpions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also participate in this molting
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some great top molting animals
link, if you want to view that,
[SPEAKER_00]: for snakes, crabs, and scorpions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of cool there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most complicated one here,
deuterosome development.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: A mouth developed separately from the
blastopore.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this diagram, showing the difference of
two major coelomates based on the basic
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern of development.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our protosomes and our
deuterosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protosomes are more primitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They include flatworms, nematodes,
mollusks, and anilids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deuterosomes have evolved from protosomes
more than 630 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now initially, we're going to look at and
see some similarities, but there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: key differences here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the deuterosomes, this is located down
here, the blastulites is called the radial
[SPEAKER_00]: cleavage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about cleavage here
being splitting or dividing of cells
[SPEAKER_00]: because it occurs parallel or
perpendicular to the major polar axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see in deuterosomes the
development here of a digestive tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really present here in the protosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protosomes think more primitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In protosomes, these are called,
as you see here, spiral because division
[SPEAKER_00]: planes are oriented, have an oblique way
to the polar major axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing initially this eight cell
stage here, radial cleavage or radial
[SPEAKER_00]: dividing of cells versus our spiral
dividing of cells here.
[SPEAKER_00]: See development of different organizations
during gastrulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our deuterosomes are more developed here
because we have that development of a
[SPEAKER_00]: digestive tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: That word cleavage, again, may not be the
first thing you may think of, but division
[SPEAKER_00]: or split is how it's going to be referred
to here in science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Process by which a zygote divides by
mitosis to form new cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, a zygote goes through cleavage to
form our eight cell stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: More cleavage, more dividing of those
cells, more cytokinesis, if you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we see more and more dense cells
packed in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: During embryonic development, the zygote
undergoes a series of mitotic divisions or
[SPEAKER_00]: cleavages from an eight cell stage and
then allows a hollow blastula.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the process called gastrulation,
the blastula forms inward and forms a
[SPEAKER_00]: cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, and this is showing or indicating
more specialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last slide here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at major animal phylum,
the diagram below shows the body plans for
[SPEAKER_00]: nine major phylum animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, each can be traced back to a
common animal ancestor, and we see them
[SPEAKER_00]: dividing out here, each with different
complexities and each with different
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals that represent them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find those on the YouTube channel
that should describe each of these in a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more detail.
Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
