[SPEAKER_00]: In this Debaco University video,
I'm going to handle the often
[SPEAKER_00]: controversial properly naming of cannabis
and how we should go about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into properly naming
cannabis or really any plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, it's often asked should we
use the term strain or variety or sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: or indica or hybrid or something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really all the above terms are
inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really cultivar is what should be used
because this is a cultivated variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cultivar is working at that cultivar is
kind of how we're getting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be sure we're using the right
tool for the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the proper way to go about
naming plants that's been established.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just taking another plant as an
example, for example, an apple here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Macintosh apple, we could see here
that should proper scientific names should
[SPEAKER_00]: usually be italicized as far as the
botanical names.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this same concept botanically should be
also applied to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, sadly, it's not really being applied
in this way, but at least this would be
[SPEAKER_00]: the proper way to name this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So word of caution, just in general,
contrary to what you may have heard,
[SPEAKER_00]: the distinctions between the different
varieties is genetically debated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Differences in morphologies are the main
source of classification with many new
[SPEAKER_00]: cross breeding occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been mixing types leading to the
blurring between the two groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, this leaf morphology has a
strong sativa indication where this one
[SPEAKER_00]: right below me has more of an indica kind
of morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind what the hybrid and the
breeding that's occurring, you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes a blending or a mixing of the
two quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I might just look at this
quick image and say, oh yeah, sativa and
[SPEAKER_00]: indica might be more to it than just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that requires that genetic testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the work in progress of a library of
different genetics, there's no clear link
[SPEAKER_00]: between plant morphology and cannabinoids
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another important distinction that
just because we see an indica or a sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: name, we can't automatically associate a
certain amount of cannabinoids or terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: with that variety, with that cultivar,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, we need to be aware of the
differences that occur, the hybrids that
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to look more at the chemical
profile and not just indica or sativa when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about cannabis as is so
often done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, name is sometimes meaningless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another issue is consistency among the
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will purchase the same variety from
two different shops with vastly different
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because the lack of our current
genetic screening and also checking to
[SPEAKER_00]: help ensure consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of the issues with cannabis
is that lack of consistency on many
[SPEAKER_00]: fronts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the general classification of cannabis
as we can see here, cannabis is classified
[SPEAKER_00]: as cannabis sativa regardless of its
origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it can be further classified into
three main classifications, the sativa,
[SPEAKER_00]: the indica, or the rudalis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rudalis is the auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are going to flower based on day
old, not photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have our indicas and our sativa,
which are photo period dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you give you a general kind of
morphology of the leaf and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, you can see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this kind of gives you an
idea of how to properly classify and name
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, even though it may not be the
current system that is being utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
