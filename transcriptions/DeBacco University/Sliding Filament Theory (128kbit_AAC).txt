[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go over the sliding
filament theory here, which is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important for muscle contraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to break it down into five basic
steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, I think it's important just to
understand where it got its name from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the sliding filament.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in order for muscles to contract,
the filaments, actin and myosin,
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially slide against one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we have our actin and our
myosin, and they're sliding against one
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's performing our contracted phase,
and then when they're close together,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then our relaxation phase is when they
separate out again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where it gets the name from the
sliding filament theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those filaments, again, are those
actin and myosins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They themselves are not shortening in any
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just sliding against one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that look?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when signaled by a motor neuron,
because again, we're looking at motor
[SPEAKER_00]: neurons controlled here and skeletal
muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at our skeletal
muscles, we get that signal from the motor
[SPEAKER_00]: neuron, which I have another independent
video on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The muscle fiber contracts as the thin
filaments are pulled, and then slide past
[SPEAKER_00]: the thick filaments within the fiber's
sarcomere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here's our relaxed phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the distance here is
greater than distance here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's happening is our green
molecules here, our actins are sliding
[SPEAKER_00]: against our thicker purple molecules here,
which are our myosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we see the arrows pointing
inward, because we're getting that
[SPEAKER_00]: thinning here, that contracting phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sliding can only occur when myosin
binding sites on the actin filaments are
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed by a series of steps that begins
with calcium ions entry into the sacral
[SPEAKER_00]: plasma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we notice here, look very closely,
there's basically a space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here on the contracted phase, we see that
there's these small things kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the myosin binding sites,
and they're exposed by a series of steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order for this to occur, it all has to
be initiated with calcium ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this muscle contraction kind of summary
here, it's kind of that general summary,
[SPEAKER_00]: this cross bridge of muscle contraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, muscle contraction is triggered by
calcium ions binding to the actin active
[SPEAKER_00]: site.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here, our triple myosin here,
our myosin head trying to bind to our
[SPEAKER_00]: actin, the purple trying to bind to the
kind of the gray actin here, cannot occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Troposin is actually blocking that.
[SPEAKER_00]: With each contracting cycle, actin moves
relative to myosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order for it to move along that,
that calcium first has to bind to this
[SPEAKER_00]: tropon and get out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our myosin is binding to our actin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is then allowing our heads
turning, and so it's allowing that sliding
[SPEAKER_00]: to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all starts with that calcium ion to
move that tropon out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the muscles relax, the attachment
sites for myosin are blocked by the tropon
[SPEAKER_00]: myosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here, again, this is ahead of
the cycle coming back around, that calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: is leaving, tropon myosin is coming and
blocking that myosin from binding to the
[SPEAKER_00]: actin.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order for a muscle to contract,
tropon myosin must be removed by another
[SPEAKER_00]: protein called tropamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this complex, tropon myosin complex,
is regulated by calcium ion concentrations
[SPEAKER_00]: in the muscle cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's look at this complex and this
process in a little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna present this as five basic
steps I'm gonna build on each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna look at the same kind of
diagrams I'm gonna build from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first part, okay, or step one,
the active site and actin is exposed as
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium, which is represented here,
calcium ions binds to tropamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see our tropon myosin, our
tropamine, here's our calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the active site and actin is exposed as
calcium binds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this myosin cannot bind to any of these
regions, it has to only bind to this
[SPEAKER_00]: complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our myofilaments are made up of actin and
myosin, so that's important to keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the green circles are the
actin, in this image the blue circles are
[SPEAKER_00]: the actin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are what we call the thin
filaments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They consist of two chains of actin
molecules wrapped around one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myosin are the thick filaments,
red here and the purple in this image,
[SPEAKER_00]: may also consist of two chains wound
around one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll look at them in the next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: One end consists of a very long rod,
while the other consists of double-headed
[SPEAKER_00]: region called the head region.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here the myosin head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the myosin head forms this cross-bridge
with the actin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of see our building here
of the image.
[SPEAKER_00]: The myosin head is attached to the actin,
the myosin binds actin at its actin
[SPEAKER_00]: binding site, forming this cross-bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is this cross-bridge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's the actual binding resulting
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this cross-bridge forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember our red molecule here,
these are calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all initiated with calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's allowing this binding site
to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the power stroke, the myosin
head bends and ADP and phosphate are
[SPEAKER_00]: released.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this bending action, the phosphate is
generated in the previous contracting
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle is released, this is PI.
[SPEAKER_00]: This results in the myosin pivoting
towards the center of the sarcomere,
[SPEAKER_00]: after which the attached ADP and phosphate
group are released.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we say this power stroke,
this myosin head binds to the ADP and
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphate release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because this is a power stroke,
what's actually happening is, think of my
[SPEAKER_00]: head as the myosin head, and here's our
actin, but when it binds to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it's moving, and that's what's
causing that sliding motion to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're seeing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This power stroke, this myosin end
bending.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is requiring energy, but that's
what's essentially occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cross-bridge is made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're having this myosin bind to the
actin and then move, causing these
[SPEAKER_00]: filaments to slide against one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a new molecule of ADP attaches to the
myosin head, causing the cross-bridge to
[SPEAKER_00]: now detach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially we kind of went through,
went down to it, we moved it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we need to detach, and if we were to
go through and repeat this process,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'd attach over here and slide it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see this cross-bridge is now detaching,
requiring ATP attaches to the myosin head,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the myosin head detaches here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice now we have a gap in the
junction here, looking for another calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule to allow our myosin to bind to
our thin actin filaments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the myosin head hydrolysis,
remember, using water to break apart,
[SPEAKER_00]: ATP to ADP in the phosphate, which returns
myosin to the cocked position.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this means it's ready now to grab onto
another molecule before it moves over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just to quick give a brief
recap, we see the initial calcium kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that binding site occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the myosin head moving over,
and then it's detaching and getting ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to bind to another site here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, ATP is required for this to
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a full summary and a great
site to kind of pause it on, this would be
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the summary of the five steps that
I just covered that go over in explaining
[SPEAKER_00]: the sliding filament theory.
