[SPEAKER_00]: Here I want to cover an inference compared
to an observation, as well as the four
[SPEAKER_00]: theories that unify biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we're looking here, how do you
think the material in the purple bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: compares to the yellow liquid?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think they smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, based on what you're observing,
you're making an inference based on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see an image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Observations are what we can kind of
measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inferences are an animal made these and a
human made them and they were walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier in that day, we can kind of see
how they were made, but be careful when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're making observations and inferences
that you're not putting your own bias into
[SPEAKER_00]: the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the four theories that unify
biology to cover those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because we're talking about
theories, we need to kind of define a
[SPEAKER_00]: theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the general public, a theory is
often used when there's a lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge or a guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in the science world,
a theory is a set of hypotheses that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been tested many times and not rejected.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a definition we're going to stick
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: One example of a theory that you probably
very well experienced is the theory of
[SPEAKER_00]: gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all know gravity exists,
but that is technically a theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting into those four themes that unify
biology, we have the gene theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where information that determines
what an organism is like with genes
[SPEAKER_00]: located along the DNA molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the picture here, we see these
chromosomes that all contain segments of
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: To progress from DNA, we have cell theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all living organisms are
composed of cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cells are the basic units of life and all
cells come from other cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have the theory of heredity,
where genes represent traits of an
[SPEAKER_00]: organism and are inherited as discrete
units.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may see some genes that are inherited
or some traits that are carried over from
[SPEAKER_00]: one generation to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the theory of evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this theory of evolution is that all
organisms are related to one another in a
[SPEAKER_00]: common tree of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diversity of the living world is a result
of natural selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bird has a very stout beak for
opening the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bird has a very pointed beak for
eating its food or its prey items.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's just kind of that four
themes that unify biology here.
Thank you.
