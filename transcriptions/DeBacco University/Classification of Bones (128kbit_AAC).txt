[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we'll look at basic
classification of bones within our
[SPEAKER_00]: skeletal system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice there's many different types of
bones, many different types of functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are very easily named, like flat
bone, and short bone, and long bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have a very irregular shape,
and they get the term irregular bone,
[SPEAKER_00]: but each is able to perform a unique
function as part of our entire skeletal
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's the shape that's how we're
going to classify them, and that shape
[SPEAKER_00]: will relate to where they're located in
the body and the function that they
[SPEAKER_00]: perform within that particular location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So classification of bones, we'll start
with the long bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're typically longer than they are
wide, and that's how they get the name
[SPEAKER_00]: long bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highlighted in red here in our slowly
rotating skeleton allows you to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the regions you can find these
long bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a shaft with heads at both ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the heads at both ends might be
different, but it is a head region at both
[SPEAKER_00]: ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They contain mostly complex bone,
and examples would be the femur and the
[SPEAKER_00]: humerus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind the humerus is located in the
upper arm here would be the humerus here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and corresponding and very similarly
looking in the general sense, down here
[SPEAKER_00]: would be where the femur would be located.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember our humerus up here,
and femur down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot of similarities between these
two long bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The head regions though are different
between the two, and it has to result with
[SPEAKER_00]: the joints that each attaches to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to be identifying some of
the bones in our body which should be very
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with where the humerus and where
the femur is located, despite them looking
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So structural long bones, they consist of
a diaphysis and an epithesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diaphysis is a tubular shaft that
forms the axis of the long bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here, diaphysis in the long
portion of the long bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's composed of compact bone,
surrounds this medullar cavity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and yellow bone marrow fat is contained
within this cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless we're talking about a very,
very young individual, basically an
[SPEAKER_00]: infant, this medullar cavity would be
composed of mostly red bone marrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind as we age that red bone
marrow becomes replaced with yellow bone
[SPEAKER_00]: marrow, which is mostly fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The epithesis expands ends of the long
bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's referring to basically the head
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also exterior is composed of that
compact bone, and the interior,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is majority is that spongy bone as
you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why it's spongy bone,
it's covered with high line cartilage,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this line here is where the different
regions meet essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something called this middle region,
not going to get too much into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part is to understand that the
yellow bone marrow, we see indicated here,
[SPEAKER_00]: is typically found in the diaphysis
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: The epithecal line is the separation
between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why there's mostly spongy bone
here is simply because this is what's
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing for that red bone marrow to be
housed and protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on the bones, we also have long bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have our short bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see where they're located,
highlighted on our slowly rotating
[SPEAKER_00]: skeleton up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, they're cube-shaped,
kind of cube-like, we'll say, and they
[SPEAKER_00]: contain mostly spongy bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're found in the carpals and tarsals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So carpals are in our hand, see here,
and tarsals are located in the foot
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the patella, or kneecap,
is classified as a short bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flat bones are thin and flattened,
usually curved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps give them some strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're thin layers of compact bone around
a layer of spongy bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our skull, our ribs, our sternum,
also our hips, are also considered or fall
[SPEAKER_00]: under the classification of flat bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the reason why they tend to be a
little bit curved is that it gives them a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more structural integrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, our irregular bones, these have an
irregular shape, that's how they get their
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really don't fit into any other bone
classification categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of the odd ones of the group
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the vertebral column would be a prime
example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not long bones, they're not short
bones, they're irregularly shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more than just a vertebral column,
some portions of the hip also,
[SPEAKER_00]: some also of the head region can be
classified as irregular bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this gives you just that basic
overview of some of the classifications of
[SPEAKER_00]: bones by their individual and unique
shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
