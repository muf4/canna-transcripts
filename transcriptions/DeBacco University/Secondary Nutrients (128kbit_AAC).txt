[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to be looking at
the three secondary nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I have the shifter here of
the car is our primary nutrients are
[SPEAKER_00]: needed first, and then secondary nutrients
are kind of the ones we would go to next
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as concern when feeding our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking first at calcium, represented
by CA, it's involved with providing
[SPEAKER_00]: structural support to cell walls and
serves as a secondary messenger in
[SPEAKER_00]: response to stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not translocate well in the plant,
so that's mindful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep that in mind as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to kind of get that through the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can show deficiency symptoms,
particularly in the newer growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil can help neutralize acids when it's
added there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be commonly found in bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that cell wall, keep in mind,
that's a very important component of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnesium is the second one I want to go
over, and it's a central component of
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll and also aids in the
activation of many plant enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the comparison here of plant
chlorophyll with magnesium there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: center.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice if we look really quick,
these structures look very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is hemoglobin in the human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hemoglobin's mining oxygen,
and we can see magnesium here being that
[SPEAKER_00]: central molecule being important for
chlorophyll production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lower leaves will typically show a
deficiency by yellowing first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dolmitic limestone, kind of that limestone
we use to correct pH, is a common source
[SPEAKER_00]: for magnesium for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep an eye out if you're using coco coir
as this media of choice and
[SPEAKER_00]: supplementation is often needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using coco coir, if that's
the media you're choosing to use,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep in mind you may have to be adding
more magnesium than a grower choosing
[SPEAKER_00]: another media source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly here, we have sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's needed for amino acid or protein or
enzyme production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, amino acids make up
proteins, and proteins are a general
[SPEAKER_00]: category for enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfur also helps chlorophyll formation
and improved root growth and seed
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfur may be applied to soil from
rainwater via acid rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is becoming less and less of
a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we're cleaning up the acid rain,
which is a great thing because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: degrading some of our forest and eroding
some of our monuments, that's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a result, that acid rain was
supplying some sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers may now need to add some sulfur
products to supplement what's not coming
[SPEAKER_00]: free from the rainwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use gypsum or epsom salts,
this will increase sulfur levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking at a way to add it,
epsom salts and or gypsum are ways to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that is the third of the
secondary nutrients and another one to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep an eye out for in your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and have a great day.
