[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be looking at a
important component of the immune system
[SPEAKER_00]: called the phagocytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see kind of a general depiction here of
phagocytes in a foreign molecule being
[SPEAKER_00]: bound to, being destroyed, and ultimately
excreted here as waste or as particles
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting into phagocytes, they basically
scan the fluid areas of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And macrophages are one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are the chief phagocytotic cells
in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are free macrophages, and they
wander through the regions in search of
[SPEAKER_00]: cellular debris.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be up to 100 invading cells
before dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's just one example here of the
macrophages, kind of the web-like fingers
[SPEAKER_00]: that come out and attach to these foreign
bacteria, and will ultimately be
[SPEAKER_00]: destroying them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have that kind of binding,
that kind of intake, that lysone to help
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy it, and then these soluble debris
is being released through exocytosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can kill up to basically 100
invading cells before they themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: perish.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have something called neutrophils,
and they become a phagocytotic when
[SPEAKER_00]: entering infectious material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to help clean up the
body to help prevent potential infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: They help destroy pathogens by breaking
them down with enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They die shortly after killing the target
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unlike our ones that we saw before,
the macrophages and neutrophils,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't destroy hundreds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They die shortly after killing the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downfall is that these neutrophils can
also kill normal healthy cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a collection of dead neutrophils is
also called pus.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever had that kind of area under
the skin that you kind of poke and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of pus comes out, well,
that's actually a lot of neutrophils.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the most abundant white blood
cells, accounting for about 54% to 62%.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of that first to come into
infection and try to clean it up as best
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they can be not quite as
selective as we saw with the macrophages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The synophils are a weekly phagocytotic
against parasitic worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They help control inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased activity during parasite
infection and allergic reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These only compose about 1% to 3% of white
blood cells here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see not heavily utilized by
the immune system, but still offer another
[SPEAKER_00]: component of protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the mast cells, and these
bind and ingest a wide range of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also release histamine, which if you
have allergies, you might be familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with, during inflammation, which is where
it's important, but also, as I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: during those allergic reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those histamines can kind of become
overactive and can kind of cause those
[SPEAKER_00]: allergic kind of reactions we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why a lot of people take
antihistamines to help mute or reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: impact that this has on the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's over-regulated, it can be quite
the annoyance.
