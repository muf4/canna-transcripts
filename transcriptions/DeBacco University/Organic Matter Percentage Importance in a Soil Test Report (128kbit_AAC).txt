[SPEAKER_00]: Now you get your soil test report back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a bunch of numbers on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them might be organic matter
percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here on this Tobacco University video,
we're going to explain its importance to
[SPEAKER_00]: the overall soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at organic matter
percentage importance in a soil test
[SPEAKER_00]: report.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just looking at here, a general soil
should be about 5% organic matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% air and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25% water, 25% air, 45% inorganic mineral
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to focus here on that little
5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what's the benefits of
organic matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it improves water retention,
increases nutrient holding capacities,
[SPEAKER_00]: encourages better soil structure,
enhances root growth, increases aeration,
[SPEAKER_00]: provides supporting environment for soil
organisms, and serves as a reservoir for
[SPEAKER_00]: plant nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you read all these benefits,
you would think, I want to grow in 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, that can also cause some
negative effects there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is good, and these are the
benefits of it, but it's good in
[SPEAKER_00]: moderation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sources of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some areas we can get organic
matter from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they include leaf mold, peat moss,
compost, as well as manures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ideal amount of organic matter varies
by crop and by soil type.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, sandy soils may benefit from
greater additions of organic matter than
[SPEAKER_00]: finer textured loams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large additions of compost or manure can
result in excessive applications of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to apply excessive amounts of
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: An application greater than a quarter inch
of compost or manure can supply an excess
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, organic matter can be a
good thing, but it's very easy and very
[SPEAKER_00]: commonly done where it's over applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how much organic matter should I be
adding?
[SPEAKER_00]: The ideal amount of organic matter really
varies by crop and soil type.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, sandy soils, as I said,
may benefit from greater amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter, than those finer textured
loams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to know what base
material you're starting with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large additions of compost can cause those
excessive amounts to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be aware that when we're looking at
what the ideal range should be,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically the darker soil will have that
darker, higher amounts of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to shoot for or aim for?
[SPEAKER_00]: 5% would be a good average to kind of aim
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at a number and wants to
know what's the number, but you don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: 10%, 15%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That some soils may have if they've over
added that organic matter because you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get into excessive nutrients, particularly
phosphorus, if you're using manures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, excessive organic matter additions,
due to all the benefits stated,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers have a tendency to think more is
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it is possible to over add and
get many negative impacts and things like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what could be a negative impact from over
adding organic matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can get increased disease
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the sense you're holding so much water,
that can really help breed a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: negative organisms and cause a chance for
increased disease to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, some of these organic matters,
especially fresh organic matters,
[SPEAKER_00]: contain nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you over add it, you get the nitrogen
bloat of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, as I mentioned, you can get
environmental contamination, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: with phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to know that while
organic matter can be a great thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: help improve your soil structure,
too much of a good thing is end results in
[SPEAKER_00]: being a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching.
