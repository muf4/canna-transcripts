[SPEAKER_00]: This tobacco university lecture is going
to focus on different types of explosives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off we have the low explosives
and these have escaping gases of about
[SPEAKER_00]: 3,000 feet per second and they're kind of
a crucial element as a physical mixture of
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen and fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examples are black and smokeless powders.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are a mixture typically of potassium
nitrate, charcoal, and sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smokeless powder is a nitrocellulose and
perhaps a nitrocarbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glycerin, a kind of compound there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting into high explosives, well these
have a much quicker velocity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The escaping gases approach 10,000 feet
per second and it's usually oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: contained in the fuel molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two types, we have the initiating,
which is sensitive and will detonate
[SPEAKER_00]: rapidly when subject to heat or shock,
and it's used to denote other explosives
[SPEAKER_00]: from an explosive train.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have non-initiating, which is
relatively insensitive, requires heat or
[SPEAKER_00]: shock to kind of cause that chain reaction
to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this includes, for example,
the ever-famous TNT.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also chemical explosives as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are ammonium nitrate,
fuel oil, ANFO, typically referred to as
[SPEAKER_00]: black powder, and dynamite would be
classified under that commercial explosive
[SPEAKER_00]: category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have military explosives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So C4, which is a also known as RDX,
when we have a whole bunch of others that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be mixed with TNT to make grenades and
other forms of explosives used in military
[SPEAKER_00]: settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, keeping with the military,
at least something that the military has
[SPEAKER_00]: to deal with a lot of, are called IEDs,
and these stand for improvised explosive
[SPEAKER_00]: devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are typically low explosives,
but they're placed in confined containers,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what makes them so dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: An IED is a bomb constructed and deployed
in ways other than the conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: military action, sadly typically put along
roadsides, so that when opposing military
[SPEAKER_00]: vehicles come by, then they are detonated
at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be constructed of conventional
military explosives, such as artillery
[SPEAKER_00]: rounds attached to a detonating mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And IEDs are commonly used as roadside
bombs, and that's typically what you see
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a general overview of the
different classifications of explosives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
Thank you.
