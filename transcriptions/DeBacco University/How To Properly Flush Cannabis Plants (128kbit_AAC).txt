[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over how to properly flush
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever wondered how to properly flush a
cannabis plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're going to go over some of the
specifics here in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, this information was
provided here by this thesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're welcome to take a look at it
here, this doctoral dissertation,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great information provided in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only a brief summary of that will be
provided here on this video lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, flushing in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically at the end of the flowering
cycle, prior to harvest, the root zone of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants will be watered with plain
water that does not contain any additives
[SPEAKER_00]: such as fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertigated water is water that contains
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give you mind to produce your regular
water with no nutrients added.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the substrate the plant is
being grown in will dictate the duration
[SPEAKER_00]: of the flushing period, how many days,
how much water will be added.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal here is to kind of take those
nutrients that might be kind of all bound
[SPEAKER_00]: up in that area and adding a lot of water
can kind of cause them to be flushed out
[SPEAKER_00]: or removed from that root zone and that
will dilute that plant there and create
[SPEAKER_00]: more of just express the plant or allow
the plant to have more of its just natural
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and profiles in there without
having necessarily the chance of having
[SPEAKER_00]: any of the nutrients and fertilizers held
in that final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flushing specifics looking at in
relation to this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flushing occurred over the last two weeks
of production when the nutrient solution
[SPEAKER_00]: was replaced with clear water during
routine irrigation events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of growers will add fertilizer to
their water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in this case, water was still added
but no nutrients were added to that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another flushing method was applied to an
additional 10 liters of water without any
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer to the plant over two
irrigation events.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the start of a two week period of clear
water irrigation and then clear water is
[SPEAKER_00]: just again no fertilizer being added.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the study was looking at in
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are the specific treatments and we
can see them all listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Control treatment with 10 liters in
initial flush completed twice of
[SPEAKER_00]: non-fertigated water until harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then then another control treatment was
without 10 liters of an initial flush and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-fertigated water until harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one they did add an extra irrigation
event and then continued with just plain
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here they did not use that additional
flushing irrigation event there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they had two mild stress treatments
they called with non-fertigated water
[SPEAKER_00]: until harvest and then one was with
fertigated water until harvest for
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the moderate stress ones were
treatments with non-fertigated water until
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest and then treatment with fertigated
water into harvest there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the durations that they went through
and did this were kind of part of that
[SPEAKER_00]: mild and moderate stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the control treatment was going to be
considered to be the standard for the
[SPEAKER_00]: facility to control which is what normally
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: With irrigation occurring events for the
plants occurring every two to three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mild stress was irrigation applied every
two days and then moderate stress was
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation applied every three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we can see that's how you get that
mild stress even though the treatment was
[SPEAKER_00]: basically the same the amount that it was
applied was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does put a moderate stress on the
plants and your water in only every three
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we've got that bud dry yield for
flower so I'm only presenting graphs here
[SPEAKER_00]: that show statistical difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that there was determined to be no
significant difference in the flowering of
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole plant dry flower in cycle one or
the bud dry flower in cycle three.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was different here in cycle two and
they did multiple replications of this dry
[SPEAKER_00]: bud mass was measured after the drying
period by removing all the buds from the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The control treatment was significantly
different from the mild and moderate
[SPEAKER_00]: stress treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see here dry bud mass was
definitely more in those control
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments compared to the mild and
moderate stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the mild and moderate stress were
also looking at the changes in irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now important components when we're
talking about cannabis we'll be looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the example here would be the THC present
percent by mass for the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note there was it was determined to be no
significant difference in the following
[SPEAKER_00]: being the THC presented by mass and flower
in cycle one as well as cycle three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here the percent in cycle sorry in cycle
two and cycle three.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was different was the THC percent by
mass for cycle one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The THC present was significantly
different in the mild stress treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're seeing the THC by mass was
the same in both the control and moderate
[SPEAKER_00]: stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example the mild stress actually
caused a reduction on the percent of THC
[SPEAKER_00]: by mass there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of an interesting note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the essential analysis of buds for the
three flowering cycles this kind of brings
[SPEAKER_00]: that general summary here and I tried to
stack them right on top of one another
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to pause the video and look
at this in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering cycle one elemental analysis of
bud after flushing shows a percent of
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration by mass of the nutrients
within the dry bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Error bars represent standard error.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no significant difference between
any of the treatments analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of looking through and
saying oh where are the differences
[SPEAKER_00]: between these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really as far as the researchers go they
determined there was no significant
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between any of the treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the control the mild stress
flushed, the mild stress no flush,
[SPEAKER_00]: moderate stress flush, moderate stress no
flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the different flowering cycles
looking at the percent nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfur, phosphorus, potassium,
magnesium, and calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: No significant differences across any of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very important note there.
[SPEAKER_00]: People always want to see a difference in
their treatments but in this case no
[SPEAKER_00]: difference is also an important result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's also we're looking at here
looking at the water reduction from the
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the volume in liters of
irrigation applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of irrigation events,
added flush amount, total liters per
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, and percent reduction using the
control of the 10 liter flush being the
[SPEAKER_00]: standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the sense that everything that uses the
most water everything else uses less
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22.9% up to 45.7% less water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking here at just kind of the
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the moderate stress
treatments was able to reduce water use by
[SPEAKER_00]: over 45%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great from a production
standpoint you're able to reduce that
[SPEAKER_00]: water bill by that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moderate stress treatments were looking
around 25% and removing that 10 liter
[SPEAKER_00]: initial flush was still able to reduce
water use by almost 23%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So important notes to take into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's the general summary?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well when we're looking at kind of
reducing that water, reducing the
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation frequency there were large
reductions in water use with little impact
[SPEAKER_00]: on overall yield and THC concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are saving water but really not
impacting the overall yield or THC
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Removing the two time 10 liter flush
reduced water use in the same treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: without the two time 10 liter flush by
22.9% with the non significant impacts on
[SPEAKER_00]: dry yield and THC concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again this is great to see no
difference in dry yield and concentrations
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're reducing water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another option for reducing water is to
examine the flushing practices
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly late in the growing cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: A significant reduction in water use for
irrigation will lead not only to reduction
[SPEAKER_00]: in water bill but lead to a significant
reduction in the humidity within the air
[SPEAKER_00]: handling system must be in a continent as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So less water added, less humidity,
less stress on your ability to kind of go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and regulate that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flushing nutrients from the substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the practice of flushing is a current
common industry practice but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: really no evidence in place published
literature of its effectiveness in
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing nutrient concentrations within
the bud or even whether or not it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: desirable result.
[SPEAKER_00]: This result showed that the intended
purpose of flushing to reduce nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations within the bud really has
no effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data shows that for the last two weeks
of the flower cycle in cannabis it was
[SPEAKER_00]: possible to use no fertilizer water for
irrigation with no significant impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: yield while saving input cost on
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great conclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at the end adding just
water flushing the nutrients, maybe not
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the flushing of the nutrients but it
really didn't change any of the nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations in the final dry flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really did not change the THC
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that significant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well you can forego any fertilizer
additives in the last two weeks cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: down your cost, cutting down your
potential environmental contamination with
[SPEAKER_00]: not impacting your final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this applies to both indoor as well as
outdoor growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there is a difference for each
growing environment the same general
[SPEAKER_00]: concept does apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifics for each are provided in other
videos if you want to know some more
[SPEAKER_00]: details for best fit your growing
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the key part is here we are really
approaching that really close to flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: and harvesting stage in that flowering
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That flowering cycle is coming to an end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be able to get away without adding
any more costly fertilizer and having no
[SPEAKER_00]: change or reduction in your total yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the amount of duration of time that
you would forego the nutrients may depend
[SPEAKER_00]: of course on your growing media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil having the longest duration of time
and hydroponics having the least duration
[SPEAKER_00]: of time that you would be watering your
plants with only pure water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again this is great to kind of know
and understand to help reduce not only
[SPEAKER_00]: your potential water bill but also to
reduce your fertilizer cost with no impact
[SPEAKER_00]: on your final end product.
