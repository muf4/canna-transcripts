[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this Tobacco University video,
I go over understanding light intensity to
[SPEAKER_00]: drive cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's see how light intensity
plays a role with cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, giving the plant more
light you'd think would naturally always
[SPEAKER_00]: be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you give the plant more light,
this can theoretically increase
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis and result in more biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, no other factors can be limiting
for this to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those other factors can include water,
nutrients, air, carbon dioxide,
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of a few other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increasing PPFD, past 850 to 900
micromoles per meter per second,
[SPEAKER_00]: a meter squared per second will require
carbon dioxide enrichment to take
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of this level of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at, you know,
we want to have a good root structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to have any disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other little factors to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we start to get above that 850 to
900, if you're not supplementing with
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide, you're not going to allow
those plants to take full advantage of
[SPEAKER_00]: that additional light intensity that
you're providing for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So light intensity by strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, all cannabis can be treated as a
high light intensity tolerant since all
[SPEAKER_00]: have been bred outside for an extended
period of time during the history of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants domestication process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is because this is a
recently brought inside plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for the most part, an outdoor grown
plant is been bred and allowed to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to handle the intensities of natural
sunlight, which typically is a lot higher
[SPEAKER_00]: than what plants would be experiencing in
an indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see our light intensity
increasing and our yield also increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this does look linear, don't think
that this continues on forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers typically increase the PPFD as
the plant ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's simply referring to the
intensity of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while some growers increase light
intensity with age, if the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements are kept optimum,
plants can be grown at high consistency
[SPEAKER_00]: constant PPFDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that stands for photosynthetic
photon flux density.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be a challenge with water,
especially when plants and root systems
[SPEAKER_00]: are small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is part of the reason why growers
tend to increase that as plants age.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as the picture here shows with the
graph, as we're increasing those
[SPEAKER_00]: intensities here with the vegetative going
to fruits and flowering kind of go into
[SPEAKER_00]: the end here, this potentially could be
brought up much sooner because maintaining
[SPEAKER_00]: high PPFD will maximize plant productivity
for all strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's especially important for auto
flowers that have only a limited number of
[SPEAKER_00]: days to complete their life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to give the plant as much
light as it can handle without burning it
[SPEAKER_00]: or causing negative setbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically this can be a little bit
higher than some growers often will
[SPEAKER_00]: provide their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at net photosynthesis
while increasing the transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So net photosynthesis and transpiration
while increasing the light intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: measured in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthetic responsive cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Variations in net photosynthesis for
cannabis sativa with varying
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic photon flux densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, that's what PPFD stands for in
temperature conditions expressed in
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at our little graphs here,
what does this kind of mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have our photon flux density,
again, both on the X axis down here and
[SPEAKER_00]: net photosynthesis here on the Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see that there is an increase
and then kind of all leveling off here
[SPEAKER_00]: with regards to net photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this graph here, we have the rate
of transpiration, which is a movement of
[SPEAKER_00]: water through plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at photosynthetic
rate, we are seeing kind of a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of a leveling off and then to decrease
kind of above that 1,500.
[SPEAKER_00]: That same 1,500, we're seeing water
consumption also being at the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to have this balance between
the plants being able to maintain their
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger pressure while still growing at
the most aggressive rate possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So light intensity maximum.
[SPEAKER_00]: While no carbon dioxide enrichment,
the maximum PPFD for the plants utilized
[SPEAKER_00]: is about 900 micro-miles per meter squared
per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: For plants to use higher light levels over
this, carbon dioxide needs to be added to
[SPEAKER_00]: the growing environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where we're having,
we can add more light and that's great,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we want to maximize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be supplementing also with
carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one note about this graph,
the two should be as a subscript,
[SPEAKER_00]: not a superscript.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PPFD level termination by CO2
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is referring to concentration of
CO2 right up over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since CO2 concentration will be the
limiting factor, the level of carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide in a grow space determines the
maximum light intensity plants can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that represented right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this assumes all other factors
are not limiting, water, nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: health of the plant in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're maximizing at 400 parts per
million for carbon dioxide, that'd be the
[SPEAKER_00]: natural atmospheric conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at a light intensity
estimated on this graph around 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we double our carbon dioxide,
we go from about 500 to about probably 850
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we go to 1400 in this graph
represented here, we can go over a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand on the light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep that in mind that yes,
you can give plants more light,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if they don't have the CO2,
they will not be able to utilize that
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So light intensity at both extremes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while growers focus on the maximum
light intensity, to get the greatest yield
[SPEAKER_00]: for photo period dependent strains,
it's also important to consider the other
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it can be difficult to measure low
light levels without special sensitive
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment at least, it is also important
to consider how dark the dark period needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers are concerned with
blackout and then one little pinhole,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they want to make sure that there's
absolutely zero light at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how dark should the dark period be?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a good question, particularly
for the indoor growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, most growers will ensure that
there's not a pinhole sized amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: light entering plants during this dark
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, plants growing outside,
regular photo period dependent ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: full moonlight will not impact cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light sensitive at night, just like
poinsettias.
[SPEAKER_00]: So full moon intensity of light will not
affect cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it may not take much more light
exposure than a full moon to have plants
[SPEAKER_00]: considered to be a day or a light on
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just realize that dark does not have to
be 100% no light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it is important to kind of seal
areas off, you don't have to be completely
[SPEAKER_00]: going over every teeny little pinhole in
the sense that your whole plant is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to flip into flower or go and stay in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, plants grown outside,
full moonlight keeps them on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just keep that in mind,
particularly for the indoor growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
