[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here at Tobacco University,
we're going to be looking at using body
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature to estimate the time of death
and how we would go about calculating
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we need to understand that
different parts of temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have something called the visceral
temperature, which is the temperature of
[SPEAKER_00]: the internal organs, those particularly
within the abdomen and thoracic cavity,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of those interior core organs,
would be the visceral temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be important to know
when we're looking at taking temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're documenting temperature,
yes, we're taking down temperatures as we
[SPEAKER_00]: would like anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the pathologist or coroner's
record, they're going to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also going to take into account
the temperature of the scene of the crime,
[SPEAKER_00]: the weight of the victim, and all other
appropriate variables to take into
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just one point in temperature,
we're also looking at the individual and
[SPEAKER_00]: the surrounding conditions, as well as the
weight or mass of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: of that individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are then applied to a formula
designed to predict the time since death.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not just one temperature and
immediately go through and through an
[SPEAKER_00]: equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to consider many factors and
should be documenting those, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're taking evidence down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that change in temperature,
diagram showing how the liver temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to the room determines the time
of death.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ambient would be the room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that taking a very sharp
decrease here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we notice that the brain temperature,
the forehead, and the liver is the slowest
[SPEAKER_00]: to progress in that downward trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the temperature of a dead body falls
at about one and a half degrees per hour,
[SPEAKER_00]: the 87 degree liver temperature indicates
the time of death was about six to seven
[SPEAKER_00]: hours before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this just kind of shows a graph
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the little figure and caption
associated with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be mindful that that liver,
because it is so interior to the body,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the most resistant or slowest to change
in temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that temperature change equation,
the usual equation is represented here
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're taking 98.4 minus the measured
rectal temperature divided by 1.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I give you the approximate hours since
death.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that the body drops at
practically one and a half degrees for
[SPEAKER_00]: each hour after death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping in mind, this is looking at that
core temperature, and this is looking also
[SPEAKER_00]: at our temperature taken in Fahrenheit,
because that would be 98.4 would be pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: much the average or the starting
temperature of the human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see them expressed in Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see again over time that core
temperature, interior most, is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the slowest to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind when taking temperature,
we want to make note where we're taking
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want to take more into the
temperature of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want to consider the environment
that that body was found in to help tell
[SPEAKER_00]: the most effective story of what's going
on in that particular scene.
