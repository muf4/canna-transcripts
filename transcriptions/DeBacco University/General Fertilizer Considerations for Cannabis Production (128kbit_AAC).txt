[SPEAKER_00]: Here in this DeBacco University video,
I'll be going over some general fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: considerations that apply to really any
fertilizer you might be adding to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over some general
fertilizer considerations for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we want to consider the
general fertilizer ratio and the dilution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a general guide, two to one to two,
which is the N phosphorus, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: the nitrogen phosphorus potassium ratio,
is often considered to be the standard for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be a two, one, two,
or a 20, 10, 20, or a whole other host of
[SPEAKER_00]: potential nutrients there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a 10, five, 10 as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regarding concentrations, manufacturer's
recommendations should provide a good
[SPEAKER_00]: starting point and use those as kind of
maximums.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go a little bit lower than that
and then see how your plants respond and
[SPEAKER_00]: work your way up to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, I don't want to go much higher than
the general recommendations by the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer because it could lead to
other issues with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that fertilizer concentration check,
once you go through and do the math and
[SPEAKER_00]: dilute it out, in general an EC,
or parts per million meter, can be used to
[SPEAKER_00]: check the concentrations of nutrient
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to kind of have this secondary
device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electronic connectivity, or EC,
or parts per million, PPM, meters measure
[SPEAKER_00]: the salts in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, tap water could have a 0.4 or
about 200 parts per million ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrient solution example should be
1.3 or around 650 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just to give you an idea of how
concentrated your actual nutrient solution
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if it's too concentrated,
that could cause issues to the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: could cause some unnecessary stress to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the stage of growth,
for example, if you're talking early on
[SPEAKER_00]: clones or seedlings, we want to be really
mindful of that continually monitoring
[SPEAKER_00]: that so we don't risk damaging that entire
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then using the meter, so what we're
going through and using whatever chosen
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer meter we use, the goal is to
measure the water being given to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and is also what is coming out of
the container or substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help growers dial in their
feeding concentrations so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize plant production while limiting
nutrients lost or wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning, if you know X amount is going
into the plants and then you have your
[SPEAKER_00]: container and you measure what's kind of
coming out at the bottom, you can have an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of what you may or may not be over
fertilizing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a lot coming in and a lot
coming out, well, you might want to read
[SPEAKER_00]: use the amount that goes in to try to
allow plants a chance to uptake those
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients to be utilized instead of being
flushed through and wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great way using that meter of
both your irrigation water as well as your
[SPEAKER_00]: pour through water to get an idea to
better dial in your particularly growing
[SPEAKER_00]: situation to maximize plant efficiency
while minimizing losses that could
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminate the environment and incur
unneeded expenses.
