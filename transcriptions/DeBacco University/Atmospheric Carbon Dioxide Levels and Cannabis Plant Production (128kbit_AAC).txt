[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to grow your cannabis plants
at normal atmospheric levels of carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide that doesn't require any
additional enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants have been doing just fine on this
level of carbon dioxide for many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many, many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: All outdoor plants are subject to
atmospheric levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's a couple things you
should keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at growing plants at
atmospheric carbon dioxide levels related
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we talk about atmospheric conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been on the rise here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see some circulation, but overall,
we do see a kind of, in this example,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of an increase here, a linear
progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Running around that kind of, around that
400-ish parts per million would be
[SPEAKER_00]: considered atmospheric levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I said, I'm going to use 400 parts
per million to be that normal atmospheric
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that cannabis has been grown
at atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: All outdoor plants, that's what they're
subject to.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can produce quality yields assuming
no other factors are limiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, atmospheric conditions are
on the rise and they are varying year to
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we are growing at atmospheric
conditions, something we want to keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind is air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by simply circulating air around the
cannabis plant, a grower can deliver 400
[SPEAKER_00]: parts per million of carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fans and air circulation are important
components of any growing environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this supplementation of carbon dioxide
comes as a bonus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have the air be stagnant
because plants can consume the carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide and actually reduce those levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by circulating air, particularly
bringing outside air in, it's a great way
[SPEAKER_00]: to ensure they're constantly getting that
normal, about 400 parts per million
[SPEAKER_00]: atmospheric levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, growing plants at these atmospheric
levels, there's no need for any additional
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment or monitoring devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes a very easy grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be an indoor grow, but this
could also be an outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably a little easier in the outdoor
grow, but even indoor grow, keep that air
[SPEAKER_00]: moving, keep bringing air out from the
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to ensure your growing environment is
at least at atmospheric levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: because dense plant canopies can cause
that to drop below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are some challenges with
atmospheric conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If air ventilation is not sufficient while
plants are consuming large quantities of
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide, this can cause those
carbon dioxide levels to drop below
[SPEAKER_00]: atmospheric conditions, which is around
400 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those drop below 250 parts per million
or lower, this will actually result in
[SPEAKER_00]: plant stunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: With no monitoring, it can be difficult to
know if this happens, so just constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: keep air moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we see the kind of the example here
with lettuce crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many crops, like lettuce, could benefit
from supplementation of carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant on the left received less than 400
parts per million, and the plant below
[SPEAKER_00]: here received 500 parts per million,
which again, is above atmospheric levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we can see these difference here,
at least visually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for indoor conditions, keep in mind
with indoors, lighting needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: supplemented as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If only using atmospheric conditions,
lower light intensities can potentially be
[SPEAKER_00]: used, because even under 400 parts per
million of carbon dioxide, plants will be
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide limited if given higher,
which is considered above 900 micromoles
[SPEAKER_00]: of light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind that if you're
seeing different lights for sale,
[SPEAKER_00]: a high-intensity light, it may recommend
with carbon dioxide, because plants at
[SPEAKER_00]: atmospheric levels cannot really use it
much above 900 micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these atmospheric levels, normal
atmospheric levels, can produce good
[SPEAKER_00]: yields, as growers have been working with
this for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this should be considered the
standard or control production levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you add carbon dioxide,
you have the potential to increase your
[SPEAKER_00]: yields from here.
