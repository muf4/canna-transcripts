[SPEAKER_00]: In this Debaco University video,
we're going to be investigating heat
[SPEAKER_00]: source as a carbon dioxide delivery for
cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for a way to add some
heat and carbon dioxide, this can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: great way to combine both of these methods
into one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, many times growers need to
heat their spaces and a lot of times we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to maintain that nice plant
conditions and a lot of times supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: heat is needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So heating a growing area with a heater
that also generates carbon dioxide seems
[SPEAKER_00]: like an obvious choice and it can be very
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, growers need to realize that when
the heater will actually be on in a
[SPEAKER_00]: regular 24-hour day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the heat is only needed during the dark
or night period, the addition of carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide will not provide the plants with
much benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only when the lights are on or the sun is
out will the plants actually utilize
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the fall, winter, spring area
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in colder regions, there may be the
need to heat a grow space during light
[SPEAKER_00]: hours, which may only be during the cool
to cold seasons of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will cause a slight unevenness in
growth related to the amount of carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide enrichment, but when heat is
needed anyway, it can be a worthwhile
[SPEAKER_00]: addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may not be something you're adding
in the summertime because you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: adding cooling systems, but this could be
a way to help benefit during the colder
[SPEAKER_00]: months with adding some carbon dioxide at
least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have also the springtime push.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get seedlings or clones off to a
quick and early start, this method of
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide generation seems logical
due to the typical need for additional
[SPEAKER_00]: heat anyway during this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this may not be continued for the
remainder of the season, it can be a great
[SPEAKER_00]: way to give plants a push early when
fertilizers are typically kept at a
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum to avoid damaging of the small
seedlings or the small clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supplementing that area with carbon
dioxide, typically it's going to be cooler
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway, can be a great way to boost growth
with minimizing potential damage to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the springtime especially
typically heat is needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not use a heat source that will
also provide some additional benefit by
[SPEAKER_00]: enriching your area with carbon dioxide.
