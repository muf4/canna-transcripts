[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
the sediment filter and details
[SPEAKER_00]: surrounding that will be covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go over using a sediment filter for
cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what is a sediment filter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get started with the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sediment filter captures and removes a
particulate matter such as soil and debris
[SPEAKER_00]: from the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can apply to both municipal as well
as natural water sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flakes of rust can enter your water supply
from corroded galvanized plants to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plumbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rainwater can carry silt, clay,
soil, and grains of sand into your
[SPEAKER_00]: groundwater supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important, if you have any of
these, to be utilizing a sediment filter
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can take out that particulate so
you can be left with clean water,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least that looks clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sediment filters, keep in mind,
do not remove any contaminants,
[SPEAKER_00]: only the physical sized particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the advantage of a sediment
filter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sediment filter is the first line of
defense against dirt and debris in your
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This prohibits all of the solid
particulate from entering your water
[SPEAKER_00]: supply and impeding the performance of
your water filtration systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as carrying of irrigation pipes,
could be wearing out pumps, doing damage
[SPEAKER_00]: to any sort of filters or o-rings down the
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sedent filter is a great guard against any
of that from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do sediment filters work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sediment filters physically block
unwanted particulate matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on its size, sediment filters are
like a net that catches the particulate
[SPEAKER_00]: matter traveling in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see an example here,
we have our larger particles, our smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: particles able to pass through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sedent filter is going to take out those
larger clay, sand particles in comparison
[SPEAKER_00]: to something really fine, like ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of might look like this in the
end, where it looks like it's all encased
[SPEAKER_00]: with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are more of a paper component,
some more of a mesh screen, all of them
[SPEAKER_00]: basically work the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: A way of filtering out those larger
particulate sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do sediment filters remove?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the sediment filters can remove
visible particles of matter and any
[SPEAKER_00]: particles of dirt, sand, dust and debris
that can be caught by its micron rated
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sediment filters also remove turbidity
from the waters we can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we said, what does sediment filters
remove?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends on what size the sediment
filter you have, the smaller the size,
[SPEAKER_00]: the greater amount that will remove.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, typically also the slower the
flow rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why there are different sizes,
because it may affect the flow rate or the
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons per minute you're getting through
that filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the limitations of a sediment
filter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because every filter, again, has some
limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sediment filters do not remove chemicals,
heavy metals, bacterias or dissolved
[SPEAKER_00]: particulate matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not improve the taste or smell of
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be aware, if that's what you're
looking to remove, sediment filter is not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a good solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may produce water that looks clear and
that can be a good thing, but doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily remove the chemicals,
bacteria or heavy metals from that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, sediment filters are still very
common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sediment filters are the most effective
when serving as pre-filters for other
[SPEAKER_00]: filtration systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're typically used in conjunction with
other filtration methods like reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: osmosis or carbon filtration as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're typically the first line of
defense to make these filters last longer
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: To take on anything that might be in the
irrigation water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the different types of
sediment filters?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we get into some more of the
details.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our pleated filters are best suited for
large particulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also washable and reusable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have melt down, melt blown
filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are best suited for fine
particulates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of that different particle
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know what's in your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then here, right below me, we have this
string wound filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once overloaded with sediment,
they will pass them through indicating the
[SPEAKER_00]: need for filter change, but this could
cause issues down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind that this melt blown
filter is great for fine particulate
[SPEAKER_00]: string, it works great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden, once it fills,
it'll let those particulate goes by and
[SPEAKER_00]: that can cause some severe issues down the
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also have something called bag
filters, which change in micron size
[SPEAKER_00]: between one and 200 microns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a spun down filter
designed to remove large size debris from
[SPEAKER_00]: the water as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, depending on what you're trying
to remove, we'll determine what type of
[SPEAKER_00]: sediment filter might be the best option
for you to select.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just talk about micron size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sediment filters micron rating
indicates what size particles the filter
[SPEAKER_00]: will be able to eliminate.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, a 10 micron filter will
remove anything 10 microns and larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The micron size of your sediment filter
will vary based upon the respective size
[SPEAKER_00]: of the sediment you are seeking to
eliminate from your source.
[SPEAKER_00]: For reverse osmosis or RO system,
a five micron sediment filter pre-filter
[SPEAKER_00]: is typically recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this just kind of shows that relative
comparison of microns compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: average human hair being about 150 and
working way down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just again, give you just a general idea
of sieve or mesh size, inches in the
[SPEAKER_00]: microns and the typical material that
might be removing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nominal versus absolute filter ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of something that often is used as
interchangeable terms when clearly it is
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nominal mean or average five micron rating
means that the filter is designed to
[SPEAKER_00]: capture approximately everything five
microns and above.
[SPEAKER_00]: An absolute five micron rating means that
the filter remove over 95% of anything
[SPEAKER_00]: five microns in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind that the nominal
versus absolute is also probably going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have significant price difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: An absolute rated micron filter can ensure
specific contaminant is removed from the
[SPEAKER_00]: water source.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, that's probably going to pay
a little bit more for that type of
[SPEAKER_00]: precision in your filtering method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the frequency of filter changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone wants to know, well, how often do
I need to change that filter?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really depends on many factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: One reliable method is to watch for a
water pressure drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times you have your water
filter and you'll have a little pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: gauge before and after it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure those gauges are
reading the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one starts reading a little bit lower,
it's a sign it might be time to change
[SPEAKER_00]: that filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply because a filter clogged,
which is filled with sediment,
[SPEAKER_00]: will cause a reduced water pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can be a great easy way to
indicate that filter probably is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the general recommendation is to
change the filter or at least check it
[SPEAKER_00]: every six to 12 months, depending on the
flow rate and rating and also the type of
[SPEAKER_00]: water you have coming into that filter
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have an idea, you can make note
of it, write it down and you can have an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of how frequency you will change your
filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that pressure drop is a great way to
know exactly when it's time to check that
[SPEAKER_00]: filter and most likely time to change that
filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you have an extra on hand.
