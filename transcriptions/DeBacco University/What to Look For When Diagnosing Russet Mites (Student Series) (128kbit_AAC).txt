[SPEAKER_00]: This DeBaco University video will tell you
what to look for when diagnosing russet
[SPEAKER_00]: mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we're going to toss it over to my
student, Connor, and we're going to let
[SPEAKER_00]: him kind of guide you through what he
looks for on cannabis plants when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to identifying russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other videos on this on the
channel, and I'll put those in a link in
[SPEAKER_00]: the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for right now, let me turn over to
Connor as to go over what to look for for
[SPEAKER_00]: russet mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on cannabis plants, what I personally
look for on the new shoots of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: itself, on the new growth, I'll use like a
low magnification dissecting scope to
[SPEAKER_01]: really get in there, usually like one to
two times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'm looking for is little tiny
grub like larvae.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost like a maggot that is covering the
new growth ball that is forming on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you'll actually see is not only
just larvae, but you'll see a few adult,
[SPEAKER_01]: live, larger mites almost look like
spiders running around, kind of tending to
[SPEAKER_01]: the larvae and laying new larvae.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, normally on the small new buds that
are forming, on the actual leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll see them too, especially in the
internodes of the leaves where the leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: actually connects to the stem of the plant
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right there, that little green spot is
where I find to be the highest traffic
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the actual plant itself,
these insects and their larvae are not
[SPEAKER_01]: that visible to the eye, but what you can
see with your eyes is the damage that they
[SPEAKER_01]: cause to the actual plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll usually notice it on the lower leaves
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be, as you can see here,
this weird kind of off-color green,
[SPEAKER_01]: almost like a tannish, burnt brown,
orange color on the new nodes of bud
[SPEAKER_01]: growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, on this branch right here,
you can see this weird almost folding of
[SPEAKER_01]: the outer rim of the plant leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: On multiple occasions here, and even on
the new growth, if you look, it's already
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in pretty folded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call this tacoing, and this is a true
identicator of russet mites on him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you also notice when you have
russets is a weird odd discoloration of
[SPEAKER_01]: the initial new growth spots, almost like
a tannish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even on this one too, you can see a
tannish, almost burnt, orangey tannish.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see a hinge on the plants compared
to, say, some nice green growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like over here, it's a lot more lighter
green, almost a yellow bud growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll also notice on the leaves
itself, some stippling and some damage,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's caused by the larvae feeding on
the actual plant structure itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over here is another good example.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see how almost orangey and burnt
it is compared to a new healthy growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as you can see here on this healthy
plant on my left hand, you have nice
[SPEAKER_01]: straight internodes, nice healthy white,
almost white green growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you look over on the russet infected
plant, and the growth is not straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's curly, almost burnt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see slight orange here on the
internodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And overall, it just looks like there's
something off about the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the new growth up here,
on the healthy plant, look at how straight
[SPEAKER_01]: those leaves are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice and healthy and has a lot of
pressure in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over here, almost getting wilt and
curled leaves and the new growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's caused by, once again,
the feeding of the larvae on the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: structure itself, hindering our yield in
the long run.
