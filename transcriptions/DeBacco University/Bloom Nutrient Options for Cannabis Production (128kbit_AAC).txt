[SPEAKER_00]: In this Debaco University video,
bloom nutrient options will be considered
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're looking at cannabis production
to give you a better understanding of just
[SPEAKER_00]: what this classification of nutrients is
all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into bloom nutrient
options for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the nutrient shift that does
occur during the bloom phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrient requirements of cannabis will
change as it starts to flower with less
[SPEAKER_00]: demand for nitrogen and more phosphorus
and potassium being needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, keep in mind this is within
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot force feed plants high amounts
of any nutrient without damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just because we're saying it's less
demand on nitrogen, does it mean that's no
[SPEAKER_00]: demand on nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no exact ideal ratio of nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium, fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but growers should be careful not to
over-add nutrients since this can cause
[SPEAKER_00]: damage to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can continue to use veg or grow
nutrients as this are often kept in
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation for the duration of the growing
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply don't think that just because it
says a veg nutrient, you cannot use it
[SPEAKER_00]: during the bloom phase or flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might use it to a less extent,
but still can be used throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire growing phase of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to look at fertilizer ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you and the plant are adjusting
through the growing cycle, be sure to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: an extra eye on your plants and continue
to keep a diligent log of documenting what
[SPEAKER_00]: you fertilize and how much you fertilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good starting point is to go with a
consideration of a two to one to two ratio
[SPEAKER_00]: during the grow phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you're flipping to that
flowering phase, taking those ratios and
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusting them to a one to two to one
ratio used in rotation with the vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: stage formulation during the flowering
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's twice as much nitrogen and potassium
as it is phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is twice as much phosphorus
as it is nitrogen and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this doesn't mean you just completely
disregard these, use them in rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where to get these ratios?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you look at the guaranteed analysis
and that's giving your nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus, potassium, but also keep in
mind many fertilizers are also including a
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrient blend as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do not forget about calcium as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just another nutrient to take
into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the main three primary nutrients are
the focus, growers should also be on the
[SPEAKER_00]: lookout for calcium deficiency as well as
this tends to be more common later in the
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're growing in coco coir where
the threat exists during basically the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire growing season, calcium should be
kept in mind, particularly at that later
[SPEAKER_00]: phase, that flowering phase of the growth
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, in final flower development,
we're looking at one night here,
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks six, seven and eight make up the
final stages of flowering in most strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering development is often determined
by inspecting the trichomes and tracking
[SPEAKER_00]: basically their change in coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the color change occurs, often growers
will reduce and flush their plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: plain water to reduce the amount of salt
buildup in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will ensure also that there's no
fertilizer residues in the buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: which could impact the final product and
taste as well as inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that finer flower development is
reneering that couple little things you do
[SPEAKER_00]: at the very end to maximize the quality of
your end product.
