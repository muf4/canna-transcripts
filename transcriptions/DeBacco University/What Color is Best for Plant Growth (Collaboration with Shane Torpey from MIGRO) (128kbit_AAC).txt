[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to this DeBaco University video
where there's a collaboration with Shane
[SPEAKER_01]: from MyGrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here he's going to discuss and get into
some of the details of different light
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrums and how they impact plants to
determine what color is best for plant
[SPEAKER_01]: growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully we'll get some data here
comparing particularly these two lights
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have pictured here to give you an
informed decision before you make a
[SPEAKER_01]: purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, welcome everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Shane here again from MyGrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking specifically here, we're going to
look at the effect of blue, green,
[SPEAKER_01]: red light on plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: This always begs the question of do the
other colors matter?
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about photosynthesis and PAR and
intensity in some other videos,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're looking at blue, we're looking
at green, we're looking at red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are these the most important colors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we need a blending of these colors?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do these colors do to the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll leave it to Shane to give us a
little bit more insight into these three
[SPEAKER_01]: main colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how they affect plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we covered before PAR, that is
photosynthetically active radiation,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the light that plants use in the
photosynthesis reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they use to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the range of light intensity in PAR
ranges from 400 nanometers up to 700
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That in visual terms is blue, green,
and red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this full spectrum of visible light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants do react a little differently
to those different spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting off with blue spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So blue generally will moderate plant
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does that by moderating the internal
distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the distance between branches in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have a low percentage or an absence
of blue from the light spectrum,
[SPEAKER_00]: plants will generally tend to grow taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not what we want in an indoor
growing situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want short, dense plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want that so they don't go out of
control and that they stay within our grow
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want that because we want the
plants to put the energy into flowers and
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily lots of stalks and
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we move to green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green, I would see sort of as a fairly
neutral in terms of plant shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a higher or lower proportion of green
will generally not change the plant shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it does have benefits in terms of
occluded green in that it goes deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it penetrates deeper into the leaf than
blue or red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enabling photosynthesis deeper into the
leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also will bounce around in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore having green as part of the
spectrum gives a higher rate of whole
[SPEAKER_00]: plant photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So including it does increase the overall
photosynthesis occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rate of it occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red again does not affect plant shape as
such.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it is the most photosynthetically
efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So red photons will cause more
photosynthesis in relative terms than blue
[SPEAKER_00]: or green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a huge difference but it's
significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also red photons are lower energy
photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means they're electrically easier to
produce or cheaper to produce from an
[SPEAKER_00]: energy point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So red is very useful to have in part to
your spectrum to increase the whole system
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency both from an electrical and a
photosynthetic point of view.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for that breakdown of the blue key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keeping the plants nice and squatty
morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely important for indoor growers
which typically are the ones using
[SPEAKER_01]: supplemental lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ever controversial green light where
you are right this bounce around does kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of reflect in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does deeply penetrate into the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the red light we hear a lot about
in lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the red intense light or more red
you know kind of as you get into flower or
[SPEAKER_01]: some higher red producing bulbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is true that it is easier to produce
and it also has those plant benefits as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that brings up the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know if we hear a lot about these
different colorations are they all needing
[SPEAKER_01]: the same amount or intensity or should
there be times where we're shifting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we worry about one more than
another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just speak to those kind of spectrum those
wavelengths on how they relate to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and what it needs in the intensity
of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said with regard to blue it is
critical for indoor growers to have blue
[SPEAKER_00]: in the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been shown that about three percent
blue is sufficient to get a reasonably
[SPEAKER_00]: short growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: However increasing that percentage blue to
maybe 12 15 percent will give you
[SPEAKER_00]: increasingly shorter plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is beneficial to have up to around
15 percent blue in the spectrum for indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: growers just to ensure that the plants are
short and dense as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond that it doesn't really add any
extra benefit and increase beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Level and generally then having that
minimum amount of blue which is critical
[SPEAKER_00]: with the balance of the spectrum as you
said before red is the most efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking to have as much red as
possible and then a filler of green and
[SPEAKER_00]: green being critical as you said earlier
for you know that that whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis but also so that we can see
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mixing the blue green and red maybe
remember this from school.
[SPEAKER_00]: That equals white light and white light
visually allows us to visually see the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants clearly inspect the plants see any
deficiencies in the plants regard to
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients or pests disease that type of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So white light overall having a mixture of
blue green and red is beneficial from the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant point of view plant health
point of view from the photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency point of view and also for us
the grower to see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like having this collaboration like the
quantifying for the blue light and the
[SPEAKER_01]: percentages and how that will affect
different plants and that importance of
[SPEAKER_01]: white light not only for the plant itself
but as you mentioned it on so well is that
[SPEAKER_01]: grower being able to walk down that plant
inspect that plant pick out potential
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient deficiencies potential insects
potential disease much much quicker than
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're growing under kind of a filtered
light that's only one particular
[SPEAKER_01]: wavelength or a limited wavelengths it
does make it much harder for even well
[SPEAKER_01]: trained growers to be able to pick out
differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: That white light looks nice makes it
really easy and really allows the growers
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully to appreciate their plants and
to notice if one's not going quite right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again thank you for your detail here on
the breaking down that blue green and red
[SPEAKER_01]: light and hope this helps everyone out
better understand these spectrums of
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
you you
