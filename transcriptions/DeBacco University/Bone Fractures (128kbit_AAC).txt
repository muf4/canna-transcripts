[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm gonna go over different
types of bone fractures that either you
[SPEAKER_00]: may have experienced or sadly no friend
has experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, someone may say they've fractured
their bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a lot of different types of
fractures and if you know someone that has
[SPEAKER_00]: a fracture, you may be able to ask them
more specifically what fracture that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have or if they describe how their bone
was broken, you may be able to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what type of fracture they have
after the completion of this video
[SPEAKER_00]: lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, starting with bone fractures in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bone fracture is simply a break in a
bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's different types of fractures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two main classifications are closed or
simple fractures and these are breaks in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bone that do not penetrate the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another type is called an open or compound
fracture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the broken bone penetrates
through the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not worry, I won't show any images of
this one in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bone fractures are treated by reduction
and immobilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this allows the realignment of the
bone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the period of time that someone may
stay in a cast could depend on the type of
[SPEAKER_00]: fracture that they have and also the age
of the individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the duration that they keep this
hard cast on to allow for that realignment
[SPEAKER_00]: to take place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some different types of common
fractures here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commutated one is where the bone fragments
into three or more pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is commonly in the elderly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The elderly tend to have more brittle
bones and as a result they tend to split
[SPEAKER_00]: more into more pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what I've tried to do with each of
these is provide a picture to kind of help
[SPEAKER_00]: you remember what type of fracture is
occurring with the bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully you find them a little bit
helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another type of fracture is called a
compression fracture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bone is crushed like the strong metal
weight of the hammer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's common in bones that are very porous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vertebral column, our vertebrae are
very porous and as a result they are
[SPEAKER_00]: subject to being crushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little hard to see on the x-ray,
but you can see this vertebral column,
[SPEAKER_00]: this vertebrae in this vertebral column is
definitely crushed or smaller,
[SPEAKER_00]: not quite as tall as the one below it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this can be very painful,
but these porous bones are subject to
[SPEAKER_00]: compression type of fractures.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, we also have a spiral
which is a ragged break when the bone is
[SPEAKER_00]: excessively twisted, common in sports
injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have that kind of stop and pivot and
you get that twisting action that's
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can cause a fracture here of the
bone, shown by the rope here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The esophysial, which is the emphasis,
separates from the diaphysis along the
[SPEAKER_00]: esophysial line.
[SPEAKER_00]: This occurs where cartilage cells are
dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see an image here, again,
not very pleasant even on the x-ray as you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why it tends to occur here is
this is where the calcification tends to
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This matrix is occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That growth plate is located in this
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the picture of the chainsaw
cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that almost clear and distinctive
separation amongst the bones here at that
[SPEAKER_00]: plate there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not a very pleasant experience,
but that's what's happening with this type
[SPEAKER_00]: of fracture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other types of fractures, we have a
depressed fracture, which is broken bone
[SPEAKER_00]: portion is pressed inward, a typical skull
fracture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be very dangerous, especially with
pressure on the brain or potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: bleeding, but this depressed fracture,
like the apple in the vise here,
[SPEAKER_00]: is where the broken portion of the bone is
being pushed inward in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one here is called a green
stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an incomplete fracture where one
side of the bone breaks and the other side
[SPEAKER_00]: bends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very common in children because they tend
to have more flexible bones than those of
[SPEAKER_00]: adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we call a green stick refers to a
green twig of a tree that tends to have
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of break.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pictured here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to be a little more common in the
winter where we may have a snow load.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here we have one side of the bone
breaking inside the wood portion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: trunk breaking and the other side bending.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is referred to as a green stick and
more common in children than adults who
[SPEAKER_00]: have completely ossified bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting those common fractures together,
in a nice table here, I can start to add a
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you saw a picture of one, could you
identify it?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they gave you the word of one,
could you be able to draw a sketch or
[SPEAKER_00]: identify what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone identifies that they have,
for example, a green stick type of
[SPEAKER_00]: fracture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, review these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back to some of the pictures and
hopefully you find that helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, I want to go over just how the
body repairs a bone fracture, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This blood-filled swelling is formed
initially, hematoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hematoma is referring to blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Toma is that blood-filled swelling that's
initially formed where that fracture
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: The break is spunted by fibrocartilage on
both the internal and external sides to
[SPEAKER_00]: form a callus region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this cartilage callus is replaced by
a bony callus slowly over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we need to have our bones in a
cast to hold everything in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the bony callus is remodeled to
form a permanent patch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll notice the area where that initial
break or fracture occurred is actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit thicker than it was originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body will actually rebuild and repair
that bone area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was an initial point of
weakness, the bony callus is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: going to make it slightly stronger in that
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, keep in mind that you can break a
bone twice because if that same area is
[SPEAKER_00]: applied, with the same amount of force it
was originally, while that initial site of
[SPEAKER_00]: the fracture is strengthened, both regions
on the other side are now weaker in
[SPEAKER_00]: relation to that same callus that formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind we want to try to avoid
fractures, but if you do get one or know a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend or someone that has one,
hopefully this lecture helped you more
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriately identify what is actually
going on with their particular bones and
[SPEAKER_00]: how they were damaged.
