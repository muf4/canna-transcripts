[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to cover some basic
plant tissue types.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here we've already talked about
some phloem, some vascular bundles,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the epidermis may sound familiar,
but we're going to just go over some
[SPEAKER_00]: specific ones for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's three main types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most plants have these three main types,
what we call ground tissue, in which the
[SPEAKER_00]: vascular tissue is embedded, dermal
tissue, which is the outer protective
[SPEAKER_00]: covering of the plant, and vascular
tissue, which conducts water and dissolved
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals of the plant, conducts products
of the photosynthetic process through the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see them here, our xylem and our
phloem, part of our vascular tissue,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dermal tissue, like the epidermis,
and the ground tissue, this middle portion
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and this is a cross-section of a
plant's stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three kinds of plant ground tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we break that down a little bit
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great little summary here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already talked about phloem and
xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we'll look at some of these other
types here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So parenchyma cells, they're alive at
maturity and they carry out the basic
[SPEAKER_00]: functions of living, including the process
of photosynthesis, cellular respiration,
[SPEAKER_00]: and food and water storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a very thin cell wall,
and these are the parenchyma cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: we located down here, and we see they're
unspecialized cells that carry out most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant's metabolisms here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on, we also have coenchyma cells,
which is indicated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also living at maturity and they
provide much support to the plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: organs, which secondary growth has not
occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uneven thickening of the cell wall,
I see some are thicker, some are thinner
[SPEAKER_00]: regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wall thickened with pectin and
cellulose, but it's uneven in our
[SPEAKER_00]: coenchyma cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also function in support,
even though they are living.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one away here are sclerenchyma
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: They usually do not contain living
cytoplasm when mature, and they have tough
[SPEAKER_00]: cell walls and secondary cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even thickening of the cell wall,
and the walls thickened with lignin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sclerenchyma are mainly consisting of
dead cells that have primary secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: cell walls, which provides support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see our sclerenchyma are very
thick, coenchyma are very thick,
[SPEAKER_00]: very uneven, and perenchyma containing
kind of those chloroplasts there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on, within our dermal tissue,
the flattened epidermal cells are the most
[SPEAKER_00]: abundant cells in the plant's outer layer,
or epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The epidermis is often covered in a
waxilator called cuticle, and that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: barrier against water loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our cuticle, here's our upper
epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, we don't want our plants to
dehydrate and burn, so they have this
[SPEAKER_00]: protective layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuticle, you can kind of think of like
your nails, cuticle on your nails,
[SPEAKER_00]: provides protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing for here, but in plants,
they don't want to lose water randomly
[SPEAKER_00]: through their leaves, they want to control
their water loss through their stomata
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the vascular tissue is responsible
for conducting water and dissolving
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals up the plant, conducts products
of the photosynthetic process throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a roundabout way of saying xylem
and phloem are two examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, xylem is taking water absorbed
in the roots and sending it to the shoots,
[SPEAKER_00]: and phloem can move from the shoots to the
roots, the roots to the shoots,
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever it's basically needed,
it's transporting sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, our leaves are our main
sources, and this flower could be
[SPEAKER_00]: producing petals or fruit, and that might
need sugar, so nutrients from this leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: could be coming up to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These roots could also be actively
growing, and some sugars could be sent
[SPEAKER_00]: down that way too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that's a quick overview of
some plant types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a minute, you might want to,
in particular, go over and review this
[SPEAKER_00]: slide to be able to compare these
different types of ground tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
