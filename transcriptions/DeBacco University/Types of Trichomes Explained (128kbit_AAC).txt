[SPEAKER_00]: Many growers, when they're looking at
determining the peak harvest of their
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants, will look at the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers, when they're looking at
the trichomes, notice there's more than
[SPEAKER_00]: just one type of trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this video here will explain the
different types of trichomes that you
[SPEAKER_00]: might be visually seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into types of
trichomes explained here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see them visually represented.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go into them in a little
bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what is a trichome?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, trichomes are small hair or
outgrowth of the epidermis of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically unicellular and can be
glandular.
[SPEAKER_00]: These structures are the site of
cannabinoid, terpene, and flavonoid
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why growers look at them and
think that they're so important,
[SPEAKER_00]: because really, that's where all of the
chemicals that they're looking for are
[SPEAKER_00]: being produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are found in more than just cannabis
plants, so keep that in mind, as terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: function as a natural plant defense
mechanism in other plants as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're seeing some of the visual
representation of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some we might be more familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some maybe just think as little background
structures, but they're all a protrusion
[SPEAKER_00]: of that epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we have the glandular trichomes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there's going to be a whole
bunch of different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to present some good
visual images, as well as some
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So glandular trichomes are going to be in
this category.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they produce and store large amounts
of cannabis resin, which are found in high
[SPEAKER_00]: quantities in female flowers, but are also
found in leaves and also on the stems of
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly younger plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not just only found there, they can be
found in other portions of the plant as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glandular trichomes can occur as small
bulbous trichomes with one cell stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cecil glands, which are attached directly
at the base without a stalk or
[SPEAKER_00]: multicellular stalked granular trichomes
with long multicellular stalks into the
[SPEAKER_00]: brachials surrounding the pistil flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look with a strong magnifying loop
kind of towards the area of the flower or
[SPEAKER_00]: inflorescence that's unfertilized,
you might be finding these different
[SPEAKER_00]: structures here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three common glandular trichomes
here, as we can see listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll go through each of those and
show you kind of a good picture of each so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can identify those different glandular
trichomes are all in that same category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the first one,
the bulbous trichomes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these bulbous trichomes are found
throughout the plant, but do not produce
[SPEAKER_00]: or contain cannabinoid or terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very small, 15 to 30 microns in
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are that kind of that little bit
of that kind of like bulb-like look to
[SPEAKER_00]: them and found throughout the plants,
not just in one area, but do not really
[SPEAKER_00]: contain any cannabinoids or terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not really a main focus to determining
peak of harvest or how well your harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: may go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the caputae cicil trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this example here, these have
globular shape head here and are the most
[SPEAKER_00]: common as they're found on the stems,
leaves, and also the bracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're found in multiple locations in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: While these trichomes do produce
cannabinoids, the levels produced are much
[SPEAKER_00]: lower than the caputae stocked trichomes,
which are discussed on the next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are mid-sized measuring from 15 to
100 microns across.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're a little bit bigger than the
first ones, but really produce
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, but not really to any great
degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the kind of the highlight
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the ones that most growers are
kind of seeking out and looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the caputae stocked trichomes,
and they are the primary source of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, terpenes, and other plant
oils found in cannabis plants that develop
[SPEAKER_00]: only after flower formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the kind of the key ones that
we're looking for, key ones that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be looking at as far as
determining peak harvest, going from that
[SPEAKER_00]: clear, that cloudy, to if they go a little
bit beyond maybe that amber state.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the bracts of the flower,
there are small, tiny mushrooms that
[SPEAKER_00]: measure about 150 to 500 microns tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in relative comparison, much taller
than the other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes it great for kind of that
visualness and kind of like zooming in on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we also have some non-glandular
trichomes, which are the ones that be
[SPEAKER_00]: located here as far as structures go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are hair-like extensions,
resembling leaf hairs with slender kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: pointed apex.
[SPEAKER_00]: They protect the plant from its
environment, mainly through physical
[SPEAKER_00]: means, restricting access to animals and
insects, preventing water loss or light
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation and fungal infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do have important plant functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's characteristic on cannabis to find
non-glandular trichomes on both the top
[SPEAKER_00]: and also the bottom of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's two main non-glandular
trichomes found on cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off here, so here we have the
cystolith trichomes that have
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristic bare-claw shape and have
calcium cystolith resembling knobs visual
[SPEAKER_00]: at their base.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of see them located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking really in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're found on the upper surface of the
leaves and range from 150 to 220 microns
[SPEAKER_00]: in height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frequently these trichomes are broken at
the knob feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can be broken right there at that
kind of area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see three represented or highlighted in
this labeled diagram right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have the non-cystolith trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well, and these are found most often on
the lower side of the leaves, bracts and
[SPEAKER_00]: brachials and tend to be fine and slender
shaped there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's basically, there's no like bulb
at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just kind of that looks like a
little clear hair protrusion from the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: surface there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember these are all epidermal kind
of protrusions there that are occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this was a nice kind of
breakdown of looking at the different
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking at the leaf surface,
looking at the flowers, you can have a
[SPEAKER_00]: better understanding for the diversity of
trichomes that are present on a cannabis plant.
