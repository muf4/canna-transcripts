[SPEAKER_00]: So in this lecture series, we're going to
be looking at osmoregulation in fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is something you may have to
pause the video at certain times to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to review and look at what some of
the images have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think once you look at the whole thing,
it might make more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But initially, I know this section can be
a little confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at salmon here and
striped bass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these fish are involved in
osmoregulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a balancing act.
[SPEAKER_00]: The physiological system of fish operates
in an internal fluid environment that may
[SPEAKER_00]: not match their external fluid
environment, meaning the water inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: cells of the fish may not match the
concentrations of salts on the water
[SPEAKER_00]: outside the fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relative concentrations of water and
solids internally must be maintained with
[SPEAKER_00]: very narrow limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't change the fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can only change how the fish is
reacting to the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The internal environment is influenced by
the external environment, the sense of
[SPEAKER_00]: what the fish has to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a clownfish living in saltwater,
and this is a sunfish living in
[SPEAKER_00]: freshwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to understand what stresses
most of these fish are under.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting just in general,
osmoregulation, it's regulating salute
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations and balances the gain or
loss of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cells require a balance between uptake and
loss of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excretion should make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it getting rid of nitrogen metabolites
and other waste products?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is balancing act, this
osmoregulation and excretion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Osmoregulation is based largely on
controlled movement of salutes between the
[SPEAKER_00]: internal fluids and the external
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this balancing act that's
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fish in this case is trying to
maintain homeostasis, but the external
[SPEAKER_00]: environment could put a lot of pressures
on the cell and the stresses on the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting here, osmotic challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Osmoregulators expend energy to control
water uptake and loss in a hyperosmotic or
[SPEAKER_00]: hypoosmotic environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may want to review the diffusion and
osmosis lecture series if you're confused
[SPEAKER_00]: on some of this, but let's look at some of
these just in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is comparing two fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our freshwater fish and our
saltwater fish, our sunfish and our
[SPEAKER_00]: clownfish.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fish salinity, okay, the fish salinity
is 14%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means the salt concentration inside
the cells of these fish is 14%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: On our clownfish, also 14%.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is different though, the fresh water,
the water that it's living in has 0%
[SPEAKER_00]: salinity, it's fresh water, versus our
clownfish has 35% saltwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, salts being absorbed by the
gills, it's gaining water through osmosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the arrows pointing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: These fish do not drink because water is
being pushed in through osmosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A large amount of dilute urine is evident
in freshwater fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contrast that to saltwater fish,
look at the arrows going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're drinking sea water, and what's
being excreted is salt through the gills,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's losing water through osmosis,
and small amount of concentrated salty
[SPEAKER_00]: urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is because of the different
environments that these two fish are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking specifically at that freshwater
fish, when I say that live in a hypotonic
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, think back to this slide
here, hypotonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they did not regulate the water intake,
these fish would essentially swell up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the point that they could lice or burst
their cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, this water is constantly
gaining through osmosis, some salts being
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed by the gills, they excrete a
large amount of dilute urine, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: water is being excreted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply because the cells, again,
have 14% higher concentration versus 0%,
[SPEAKER_00]: water is constantly trying to move in.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, these fish do not quote
drink, and this is referring to the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freshwater fish constantly take water by
osmosis, they lose salts by diffusion,
[SPEAKER_00]: and balance it by excreting large amounts
of dilute urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salts lost by diffusion are replaced in
foods in the uptake across their gills.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a statement of what the
previous image shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you found the previous slide better,
that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, this puts it into some nice
bullets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freshwater fish challenges, they tend to
lose ions, and they tend to be gaining
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are a couple of fish species,
very common to freshwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in my classroom, and you're
fortunate enough to work at the Panfish
[SPEAKER_00]: lab station.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a couple of panfish here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are black crappie here, our yellow
perch, and then our sunfish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's look at this marine bony fish or
saltwater fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: They live in a hypotonic environment,
so water is continuously being lost
[SPEAKER_00]: through osmosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water lost through osmosis because of the
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, our fish still has a 14%
salinity, but in this case, now our water
[SPEAKER_00]: is 35% salinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does drink seawater, and salt is being
excreted through the gills, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: small amounts of concentrated salty urine
is being lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting that into a couple bullets here,
they lose water by osmosis, gain salt by
[SPEAKER_00]: diffusion from food, balance water lost by
drinking seawater, excreting salts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and filtration rates are low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very little urine is excreted.
[SPEAKER_00]: If nothing happened, they would shrivel
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the type of environment or
stresses that's on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this again shows another image here,
where we're seeing the direction of
[SPEAKER_00]: movement of both water and ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drinking seawater, a lot being lost
through the gills and the salty urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water through the skin is being exchanged
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple examples of marine freshwater fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about, this is marine fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are fish that live in marine or
saltwater environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to lose water and gain ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a flounder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bluefish and false avocado are all
examples of marine fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have very different challenges than
the freshwater fish, and all of these fish
[SPEAKER_00]: were caught in Long Island Sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Osmotic challenges, again, this kind of
shows you again, are osmoregulars
[SPEAKER_00]: excreting that energy to uptake water.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, you may have to pause the video
and look at everything that's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes a great quiz question for being able
to compare the stresses of freshwater fish
[SPEAKER_00]: and saltwater fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So see some commonalities and see some
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep everything the same color,
look at the arrows and what's moving in
[SPEAKER_00]: and out of the fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are examples of fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at specifically sharks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharks fit into the category, these
particular sharks, into what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: osmosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Osmo-conformers, only some of marine
animals are iso-osmotic with the
[SPEAKER_00]: surroundings and do not regulate their
osmo-molarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that the fish salinity is 35%,
which is the same as the environment that
[SPEAKER_00]: it lives in at 35%.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, they're ingesting salt with
their food, water is being absorbed
[SPEAKER_00]: through the gills and skin, and salt is
excreted through the urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Osmo-conformers, they're conforming to the
environment that they're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, these sharks do not move into
areas with lower salinity, into brackish
[SPEAKER_00]: water, because it would mess up their
ability to exchange ions in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Osmo-conformers are conforming,
35% fish salinity, 35% saltwater salinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're conforming to their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The term osmo-molarity, just so you have a
definition for it, solid concentration of
[SPEAKER_00]: a solution, determines the movement of
water across its cyclically permeable
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just referring to concentration of
a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Types of osmo-regulators, aquatic
vertebrates, gills, are chief organs for
[SPEAKER_00]: excretion.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cells, this is a carp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kidneys are also evolved as
osmo-regulatory organs in fishes to remove
[SPEAKER_00]: water or conserve water.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are examples of couple kidneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put these in a graphical form.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an osmo-regulator versus a
conformer, so if you're a strict
[SPEAKER_00]: regulator, it does not matter the external
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your internal conditions are going to be
strictly regulated, meaning they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a strict conformer, as the
external environment increases,
[SPEAKER_00]: so does your internal environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, an example of that would be salmon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are strict, as you see here,
not conformers, they're strict regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, this worm would be a strict
conformer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We flip back for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, our regulators, they're regulating,
they're maintaining that homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conformers are just changing what the
environment is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect example here are salmon regulating
and our worm conforming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when they conform, this is organism
X, we just label it as a general organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because they are conformers does not
mean they can live and survive at that
[SPEAKER_00]: entire scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, this is the area where this organism
can live.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that salinity of the external
conditions gets too low, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: this would be the shark moving into
brackish water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can die, it's lethal, or if it's too
salty, they can also die.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this area where they can live,
too high and too low could lead to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at aquatic organisms that
are able to tolerate a wide range of
[SPEAKER_00]: solidities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our American shad and our American
eel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They move between the ocean and rivers for
spawning and reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spend part of their time in saltwater
and part in freshwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some migrate to the sea, some migrate off
the river.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Connecticut River here,
salmon can come up the river, but we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of salmon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every once in a while, a couple come up,
but we really have shad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shad do the same thing that salmon do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They live most of their time in the ocean
and they spawn in rivers and freshwater
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They migrate up by the thousands up the
Connecticut River.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eels are doing just the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spend most of their time feeding and
growing in the river.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're working their way down to the
ocean to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adronomous fish, like the American shad,
they only spend a very short time in the
[SPEAKER_00]: river as they're coming up to spawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows that life cycle here is an
example of the Connecticut River and where
[SPEAKER_00]: things are going in estuaries and
freshwater and where they're living and
[SPEAKER_00]: migrating to.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the springtime, eels are working their
way down south here to where the ocean
[SPEAKER_00]: water is, where the salinity is higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salmon or American shad are working their
way up the river.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Convert saltwater adaptations to
freshwater and vice versa, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: the direction of the migration.
[SPEAKER_00]: In sea, they drink seawater and discharge
salt through the gills.
[SPEAKER_00]: In freshwater, they stop drinking it and
produce large volumes of dilute urine in
[SPEAKER_00]: the gills uptake salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not every fish can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a stress on the fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of shows where the American shad
migrate up the Connecticut River.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocky Hill would be approximately right
about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Middle town is where it takes that little
notch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can travel a very long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here at the Holyoke Dam, they lift the
shad over and they count them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about 80 miles here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can continue all the way up through
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most spawn in the southern part of
Massachusetts and in Connecticut waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we do stress in a stressed fish?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is if you get one and you want to
bring it home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to minimize the osmotic
challenges by placing the fish in
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions that are iso-osmotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be to add salt to the
freshwater when transporting fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dilutes salt for the same situation
for marine species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little cartoon here shows you thought
your life was stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This poor fish is really hoping no one
pushes any of these buttons and the power
[SPEAKER_00]: is off to this circuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we want to think about more than
just osmo regulation in fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also temperature to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature exhibits the greatest
influence on fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Textile metabolism, their digestion,
signals to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: If adding your fish to an aquarium or
pond, be sure there's no temperature or
[SPEAKER_00]: salinity shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: You increase the odds that fish is going
to survive the next 12, 24 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
See you next time.
