[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over plant taxonomy and
[SPEAKER_00]: nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll really be able to compare cultivar
and variety, which maybe uses
[SPEAKER_00]: interchangeable terms and will give you an
idea of when each should be utilized in
[SPEAKER_00]: the correct situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so looking at nomenclature codes
and resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the international codes that set the
rules for plant nomenclature These are the
[SPEAKER_00]: authoritative but also the technical,
which may not make them the easiest to
[SPEAKER_00]: read as most growers would like when it
comes to discerning the difference of some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these key terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to break that down for
you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just one example here, the
international code for nomenclature for
[SPEAKER_00]: algae, fungi, and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the authorities here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The abbreviation, this is the ICN.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hear that referred to, it serves
the needs of science by setting precise
[SPEAKER_00]: rules for the application of scientific
names to taxonomic groups of algae,
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi, and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the link is provided here if you want
to look at the full extent of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also have the international code
for nomenclature for cultivated plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the ICNCP.
[SPEAKER_00]: This serves the applied disciplines of
horticulture, agriculture, and forestry by
[SPEAKER_00]: setting rules for the naming of cultivated
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here, there's already some
different areas to go through to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: proper and correct scientific naming.
[SPEAKER_00]: An additional resource provided here where
we're looking at plant names is a guide to
[SPEAKER_00]: botanical nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a third edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the code decoded example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a link provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just other things you can take a look at
if you really want to know the true or
[SPEAKER_00]: look at all the details of the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal is here to provide you,
hopefully, with an overview that's easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So parts of a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at breaking down just a
name in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the genus name, which should be
written in italics with the first letter
[SPEAKER_00]: capitalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the specific epithet,
which should be written in italics in
[SPEAKER_00]: lowercase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get on to the species name,
which is comprised of the genus name
[SPEAKER_00]: followed by the specific epithet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should be written in italics as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the first letter of the genus
capitalized, the species name is comprised
[SPEAKER_00]: of the genus name and the specific epithet
is also known as a binomial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where you get into the term you
may have heard by nomenclature,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into the proper naming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to provide you with some visuals here
to give you an idea of how this actually
[SPEAKER_00]: looks and how it's kind of like broken
down as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So popular naming of plants, we've got the
cultivar versus the variety as debate
[SPEAKER_00]: often goes on and people use them
interchangeably when really they shouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both appear as part of the scientific
name of a plant and they always follow the
[SPEAKER_00]: genus or species name.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a cultivar typically means a
cultivated variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thus a cultivar is selected and cultivated
by humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most cultivars are developed by plant
breeders and can also be called hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Variety is a variation within a plant
species that develops naturally in the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and doesn't require human
intervention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So variety is more natural occurrence,
cultivar is more with human intervention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of your key distinguishing
factor right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: To break it apart a little easier here,
again, how to distinguish a cultivar from
[SPEAKER_00]: a variety, how it's developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you look at how did that
originate, how that plant originate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it developed naturally?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, it'd be a variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was human intervention applied?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it developed through human
intervention?
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll then be a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see here the cultivar variety,
you kind of get your land race,
[SPEAKER_00]: your heirlooms moving on closer to your
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where your cultivars can be derived from
hybrids or also derived from isolated and
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduced selection and also potential
isolated and reproduced mutation as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting with that human intervention on
this side, more of the naturally occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: here on the left side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how to distinguish them?
[SPEAKER_00]: How distinguishing the comparison of the
two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds planted from a variety tend to grow
true to type, meaning the offspring
[SPEAKER_00]: retains the parent's plants unique
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds planted from a cultivar will most
likely not be true to type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the seeds you're planting after
because it's that human intervention is
[SPEAKER_00]: that selection for through the breeding
process, potentially through the creation
[SPEAKER_00]: of hybrids, you may get that not true from
type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So variety is a name written in lowercase
and italicized, and a cultivar name is
[SPEAKER_00]: written on italicized inside single quotes
with the first letter of each word
[SPEAKER_00]: capitalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that right here as the
cultivar, as mentioned with the genus in
[SPEAKER_00]: the specific epithet mentioned earlier,
defines the species, and that's part of a
[SPEAKER_00]: binomial nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So writing a variety, well, when writing a
variety name within a plant's full
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific name, this species name comes
first, followed by the abbreviation VAR
[SPEAKER_00]: period, followed by the variety name all
in lowercase and italicized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here's the variety
abbreviation, and then we can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: depicted right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example on this sign provided here
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant variety and breeding rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a plant variety is a legal term coined
by the International Union for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Protection of New Varieties of Plants,
the UPOV, that recognizes certain
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars as official plant varieties in
order to grant the creator of the cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: legal protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, it all comes back to money in some
cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has a different meaning than variety
on its own, and that's where part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: confusion comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This practice is commonly referred to as
plant breeder's rights, and the term plant
[SPEAKER_00]: variety describes a legally protected
cultivar that should not be confused with
[SPEAKER_00]: the taxonomic rank term variety,
even though, as you can see, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to make that confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not well versed in the
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cultivar species, looking here,
a plant cultivar refers to a variation
[SPEAKER_00]: within a plant species that has been
developed by a human, called a
[SPEAKER_00]: culturalist, through controlled plant
breeding as opposed to occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, the term cultivar is a result
of the blending of cultivated variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: When writing the complete scientific name
of the plant cultivar, the cultivar name
[SPEAKER_00]: comes after the name of the genus and
species, and the cultivar name is
[SPEAKER_00]: unitalicized, set off in the single
quotation marks, and the first letter of
[SPEAKER_00]: each word is capitalized, as we can see
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can also see that here following
the proper rules for that scientific name,
[SPEAKER_00]: including that cultivar and those single
quotes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, this rendition does not show that
these genus and specific epithet should be
[SPEAKER_00]: in italics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you go about establishing a new
cultivar?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to create a new cultivar, growers
cross-breed parent plants that each have
[SPEAKER_00]: desirable characteristics in the hopes
that their offspring will inherit those
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once a grower ends up with a new cultivar
with the desired traits, the grower must
[SPEAKER_00]: then ensure future generations of that
cultivar name maintain those distinguished
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grower has to use either controlled
pollination or various methods of asexual
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation, for example, plant cloning,
and that could be an example of grafting,
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture, as well as taking a
cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the grower tries to propagate the
cultivar by seed, the offspring plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: most likely not be identical to the parent
plant, losing that idea of that uniqueness
[SPEAKER_00]: or those desirable characteristics and
distinguishable characteristics of that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get to plant hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when two plant cultivars undergo
cross-pollination, the seed of those two
[SPEAKER_00]: plants produced grows essentially a hybrid
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have repeated inbreeding and repeated
inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get an inbreeded line and an inbreeded
line to breed those together, and you get
[SPEAKER_00]: a hybrid line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very homozygous and heterozygous there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have that hybrid as ideally the
best of both parents, or at least ideally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So natural plant hybrids, they do exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: When two different plant species grow near
each other, the wind or pollinating insect
[SPEAKER_00]: can cross-pollinate those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This produces a hybrid seed that falls to
the ground and grows into a new hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of the kind of genetic
mutation and those kind of increased in
[SPEAKER_00]: generic variation of certain plants to
help increase the odds of survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mutations aren't necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're rarely always a bad thing,
but in certain cases, it's really the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment that determines whether that
special difference is advantageous or not
[SPEAKER_00]: for that individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So human-generated plant hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, human plant breeders create most
hybrid plants in order to grow a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: with positive traits from both parents,
as said before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though hybrid seeds can be made
randomly in nature, hybrid seeds that you
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase are deliberately produced by
humans and kind of get into that hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: improved cultivar-related performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to hear the term with certain
industries, the term strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strains are often seen as inherent
artificial concepts, characterized by a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific intent for genetic isolation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is most easily observed in
microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly bacterial strains are derived
from a single cell colony and are
[SPEAKER_00]: typically limited by the physical
constraints of the petri dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strains are also commonly used and
referred to within virology, botany with
[SPEAKER_00]: rodents used in experimental studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not advised to apply the term strain
if you're looking at growing any type of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, despite them being plastered on
certain varieties that are called strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: have a certain strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really that's best reserved for the
microbiology world, and hopefully now you
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how to use cultivar and variety
a little bit better and kind of exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: the distinguishing difference in hybrid
between those terms.
Thank you.
