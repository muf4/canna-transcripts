[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm going to go over a little bit
of how we learn and think to give you some
[SPEAKER_00]: insight into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, we may recognize patterns
or think a pattern exists is kind of one
[SPEAKER_00]: way we think.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can recognize patterns which can be
very beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we start a car, for example,
certain pattern or sequence we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: become familiar with so we know when
something goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patterns can also be essential for
survival knowing that those from green to
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow to red lights can be very important
for safety of us and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, sometimes we run into issues
where we may try to find a pattern in one
[SPEAKER_00]: that does not exist or we can run into a
problem where we may fail to see a pattern
[SPEAKER_00]: that does exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are important considerations when
we're looking at patterns and trouble we
[SPEAKER_00]: can get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, storytelling can help fill in
gaps for individuals but often stories can
[SPEAKER_00]: go unchecked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure we're fact checking
and be able to back some information up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scientific method is a kind of ongoing
process that requires observations,
[SPEAKER_00]: hypotheses, and theory testing to develop
conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how do you relate this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, studying three hours once is not as
effective at setting 20 minutes three
[SPEAKER_00]: times a day for long-term memory retention
which is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're taking notes during your
studying you should rephrase and rework
[SPEAKER_00]: the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help you be able to remember it
for a longer term and also develop
[SPEAKER_00]: connections with that material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to review your notes and write
questions when and where did you have
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now yes, there can be moments of
frustration and this is just part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: learning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me, it'll work out in the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's null and alternate hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in scientists I mentioned the
scientific method.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about these null and alternative
hypothesis?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we test these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the null hypothesis is a statement
of the hypothesis simply not being true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the alternative is the opposite of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The example here, fertilizer will not make
the plants grow better or fertilizer will
[SPEAKER_00]: make the plants grow better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that listed out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the grass being fed fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will that help it grow or will it not?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at the running a trial,
we also want to observe the results and
[SPEAKER_00]: document those results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we're documenting and making
observations for results, it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: important that those results are only
valid if there's a compare what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: control group to make sure the same
results would not occur without the test
[SPEAKER_00]: intervention.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we had the fertilizer and the
plants grow well anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it wasn't the fertilizer that made
the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look here at how scientists think they
have two main forms of reasoning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first form of reasoning is looking at
what we call deductive reasoning.
[SPEAKER_00]: This accepts a general principle based on
observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if all humans are mortal and Albert
Einstein is a human, therefore he is
[SPEAKER_00]: mortal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inductive reasoning is looking at an
observation and going to a broader
[SPEAKER_00]: generalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: The poll show 75% of students at school X
take the bus to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aaron goes to school X, therefore Aaron
probably takes the bus to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So deductive reasoning, the premise is
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conclusion must be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inductive, the premise is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conclusion is probably true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind these distinctions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
