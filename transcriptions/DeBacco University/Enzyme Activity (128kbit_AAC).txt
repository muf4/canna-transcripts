[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at enzyme
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see in our image here the amount of
energy here required is greater with no
[SPEAKER_00]: catalyst, with no enzyme, and with an
enzyme we see that energy is reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we're starting with the same
reactants and ending with the same
[SPEAKER_00]: products, the amount of energy required is
reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to look at what can impact our
enzyme's activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some key parts are the order of amino
acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I showed a picture of the
chairs here showing a very specific order
[SPEAKER_00]: that can impact our enzyme action.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature the enzyme is in can help
and or hinder our enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our pH, certain enzymes prefer different
pHs to operate efficiently in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have our substrate concentrations
and then we have our enzyme
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll look at these in a little bit more
detail here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the order of amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wrong order equals the wrong shape
equals it not being functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here a list of amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listed by their three-letter codes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the order that these occur in is very
important because that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine the shape, how these interact,
and that is going to form either a
[SPEAKER_00]: functional or a non-functional protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting everything in the right order
is very important so that the proper shape
[SPEAKER_00]: can be had, so that the enzyme can produce
the proper function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature affects the rates of enzyme
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an optimum temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The optimum temperature is the greatest
number of collisions between the enzyme
[SPEAKER_00]: and the substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the human body, our body temps about
37 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is typically the optimum temperature
of our enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll notice here the rate of reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: As that temperature gets colder,
we see that the rate of reaction
[SPEAKER_00]: decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: What some students forget is that we have
our optimum rate and as it gets warmer,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we notice a large drop off here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because our proteins or our
enzymes in this case are denaturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're falling apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking on a different shape and
they're not able to perform the proper
[SPEAKER_00]: function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that optimum temperature is that
temperature at which we have the maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: rate of activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We reduce the temperature, we have less
collisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increase that temperature, we have
denaturing occurring causing these
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins and enzymes to not have the
proper shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: A perfect example of denaturing a protein
causing it to unfold or lose its shape is
[SPEAKER_00]: in the case of the frying an egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case where we're boiling the egg,
there are amino acids and proteins in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we boil the egg, we're then changing
those shapes and they don't go back when
[SPEAKER_00]: we cool them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another important note to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we change the shape of the enzymes,
they don't all of a sudden cool them and
[SPEAKER_00]: they go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you fry an egg, it's kind of that
same change of shape than it was at the
[SPEAKER_00]: cooler temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: At lower temperatures, molecules move
slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there can be fewer collisions between
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you see here the rate of
reaction increases as we increase that
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's a certain point here
where we're seeing a decrease that's
[SPEAKER_00]: causing denaturing to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denaturing is that proteins unfolding or
losing its shape and therefore losing its
[SPEAKER_00]: function.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that indicated right here as
temperature increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That optimum rate's the peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden we have this
sharp decrease as that temperature goes
[SPEAKER_00]: above that optimum rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just a perfect linear curve
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that optimum rate and it slows
down due to less collisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And above that temperature, we have
denaturing occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now pH can also cause enzymes to denature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the enzymes in the human body
function between pH of six and eight,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it depends where you're located in the
human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pepsin, for example, in the stomach has a
pH around three and that's where it works
[SPEAKER_00]: best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the intestines, you have more basic
pH around eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these enzymes are going to perform
better at pH eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, this enzyme has an optimum rate
right around seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see as we increase the acidity or
decrease the pH, we see that rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same as if we increase that pH,
make it more basic, we see the same
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease rate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now substrate concentration, so the rate
of reaction increases until the point of
[SPEAKER_00]: saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our substrate, remember our substrate
and our products, we're increasing our
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate, therefore we're increasing our
rate of reaction to a certain point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it kind of plateaus or peaks out,
kind of will level off at this rate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the amount of enzyme
concentration, so enzyme activity is not
[SPEAKER_00]: always linear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based on the amount of substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have the time in seconds,
the amount of product being produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a burst phase here and the amount
of enzyme located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the amount of enzyme can also impact
the concentration of the enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also impact the rate that products
are produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enzyme shape is imperative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each enzyme has a very specific substrate
that it binds to.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, you need many different types
of enzymes to be able to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different locks, many
different doors, you need many different
[SPEAKER_00]: keys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of the same concept here,
where all our enzymes have very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: shapes that bind to very specific
substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly here to change that shape,
we have something called competitive
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body needs a way to stop enzymes from
working at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have our site, we have our
substrate binding to the enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's binding just here, just fine,
and it's able to go through and perform
[SPEAKER_00]: its function.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with this inhibition site,
so if the body wants to stop this enzyme
[SPEAKER_00]: from working, it can take this molecule,
when it binds to this inhibition site,
[SPEAKER_00]: we notice the active site here changes
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, in this case, the substrate
may bind, but the enzyme can't perform its
[SPEAKER_00]: function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be a way to inhibit an
enzyme without breaking it down
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: This inhibitor molecule binds to the site
here and just can change the shape of the
[SPEAKER_00]: active site or can cause this to bind but
not be able to be broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a way that the normal
reaction would occur here just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a way that the body can
inhibit an enzyme without necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: changing the temperature, causing
denature, or changing the pH that the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment may be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we don't always want enzymes
always working and breaking things down
[SPEAKER_00]: per se, this is how the body is able to
help maintain homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can help regulate certain bodily
functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
