[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at different
tomato varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see just in these three containers
here some of the large differences just in
[SPEAKER_00]: color that we can get, but also shape when
we're looking at tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're trying to read about them,
it seems like they're always the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every tomato is like the one that's going
to completely solve world hunger.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different varieties to
consider, but remember that the
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptions you're reading will typically
only contain the positives about that
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything wants to seem like it's the
maximum amount of stars or ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of got to read through and figure
out what they're saying is going to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: most positive aspects about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's other things that might be
more negative with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, tomatoes based around size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're typically organized by the size
of the tomato they will produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can dictate by the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does your consumer want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to be growing small cherries?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to be growing larger ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mid-size?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the customer want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's going to drive what you're
going to need to choose and select to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what I look for in a tomato seeds is
disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of different catalogs
that have a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: abbreviations.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of the major ones here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole point of having increased
disease resistance is to reduce the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of spraying or kind of allow the tomatoes
to kind of fend for themselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you have an area where you
have a lot of pressure from something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be, for example, late blight is
kind of a major concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early blight can be another one,
something to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, you'll pay more for seeds that
have disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my opinion, that's a small cost to
pay for the in-season benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also this grafted tomatoes kind of
come up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, remember, there's a root stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bottom portion here that offers
disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a scion, which is a top
portion that usually produces a great
[SPEAKER_00]: tasting tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a grafted union.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the little area here to please
kind of swell up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This needs to be placed in air or above
the soil line by at least a few inches to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent rooting from coming from the scion
or the top portion to kind of negate the
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of that root stock to scion
portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, remember, when you're planting
grafted tomatoes, they can be a great way
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of get disease resistance also,
but keep that graft union well above the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you'll notice that in this tomato
variety lecture that I did not mention any
[SPEAKER_00]: specific varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I didn't is they're
constantly changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to find what works best for
your particular area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the key part here is looking at
disease resistance and also considering
[SPEAKER_00]: grafted tomatoes as an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: But make sure you keep that graft union
above the soil line.
