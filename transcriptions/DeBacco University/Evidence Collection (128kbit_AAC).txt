[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, in this Tobacco University video,
we're going to be looking at the details
[SPEAKER_00]: regarding evidence collection,
some specifics, how they pertain to some
[SPEAKER_00]: individual pieces of evidence you might be
looking at collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind you first want to define the
crime scene because crime scenes are never
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent, each is unique and presents
different challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to determine the area that will
be searched and ensure this is protected
[SPEAKER_00]: from people entering and exiting so that
there's no alteration, whether intentional
[SPEAKER_00]: or unintentional, of the evidence that
you're going to be collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at performing the evidence
collection process, keep in mind this
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be systematic and
detail-oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to start with preliminary crime
scene survey and walkthrough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to progress to determining
the evidence collected and search method
[SPEAKER_00]: that you'll be utilizing because since A
.V.
[SPEAKER_00]: crime scene is unique, you want to make
sure you're utilizing the best one to best
[SPEAKER_00]: fit the evidence you intend on collecting
for the crime scene at hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the goal in all crime scene
investigations and evidence collection is
[SPEAKER_00]: to help ensure that the evidence you're
collecting is of high integrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to keep this evidence in its
original condition as it's found at the
[SPEAKER_00]: crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever possible, evidence should be
submitted to the laboratory intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examples such as blood, hair, fiber,
soil particles, and other types of trace
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence should not normally be removed
from garments, weapons, or other articles
[SPEAKER_00]: that bear them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to move the whole article that
contains that into an evidence collection
[SPEAKER_00]: bag or container and give that to the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This entire object should be sent to the
laboratory for processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There in the lab, as you can see down
here, everything can be kind of isolated
[SPEAKER_00]: and contained to ensure or reduce the odds
of any potential cross-contamination that
[SPEAKER_00]: would occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in order to keep this consistent,
you want to make sure you're labeling
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all containers must be marked and
sealed before moving the item.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of gets to be a little bit of
a tedious task, but is a very important
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many items will have primary and secondary
containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here the primary container
that's wrapped in a secondary container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here may be placed in a plastic bottle,
which then is placed in a paper bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there could be multiple kind of areas
where you're encasing this evidence,
[SPEAKER_00]: but keep in mind all needs to be labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tedious, but very necessary
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons why I say it's tedious
is labels have certain requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could require to put the case number,
the offense, the location of the offense,
[SPEAKER_00]: the date of the offense, description of
where the evidence is, including any model
[SPEAKER_00]: or serial numbers, collector's initials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this kind of needs to be
documented for every piece of evidence
[SPEAKER_00]: that's collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of kind of that chain of
custody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're establishing that initial evidence,
and then you're keeping track of also
[SPEAKER_00]: where that is going or where that may be
shifted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the equipment for evidence collection
can be quite varied.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at gloves and forceps and
tweezers being necessary, specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at some of that smaller trace
evidence, scalpels and swabs, paper bags
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure, for good storage containers,
plastic bags often not advised in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: but can be used for some objects or
inclusion of others, cardboard boxes for
[SPEAKER_00]: larger items, wrapping paper,
thermometers, a plastic bucket for large
[SPEAKER_00]: objects to prevent them from getting
damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, the amount of equipment
needed is quite varied because each is
[SPEAKER_00]: designed to maximize different pieces of
evidence to eliminate the chance of them
[SPEAKER_00]: being altered to a great deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this physical evidence is typically
what we think of initially as evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: With any evidence, the goal is to prevent
any alterations from the time it collected
[SPEAKER_00]: to when it's received in the actual lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that physical evidence, that
transporting it here into the plastic cup
[SPEAKER_00]: here, we're taking documenting photographs
and then lifting prints, maybe collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: what we see on the ground and then putting
it into paper bags as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're handling this physical evidence
in general, we want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're photographing it to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to handle it in a way that
maintains the integrity of the sample,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is often a way it's not normal for
an object.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, you don't want to grab a
firearm by the grip when you go to pick it
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to grab it because that's
typically where the fingerprints may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to grab it in a way that might be
a little awkward, but will preserve the
[SPEAKER_00]: integrity where someone normally would
hold that particular piece of evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're packing that evidence there,
we want to use separate containers for
[SPEAKER_00]: different items collected at different
locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is intended to reduce the chance of
damage or cross contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see those paper bags being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see metal cans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see those cardboard for syringes or
sharps or knives being placed in foam
[SPEAKER_00]: inside a round plastic container here and
sealed, being zip tied to the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: this cardboard box, all ways that we can
ensure proper packing of physical
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the standard packaging requirements
we're looking at for general items are
[SPEAKER_00]: placed in appropriately sized containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why investigators will carry so
many different sizes to make sure it's
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate size for the evidence they're
collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knives, if a folding knife is found open,
do not fold it closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be placed in separate sharps
tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A folding knife and found closed,
it should be secured with tape so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: blade doesn't open and then it should be
placed in a plastic sharps tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not only to preserve the evidence
itself, but also to protect you as the
[SPEAKER_00]: investigator from getting any sort of harm
from the objects you're collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some specific requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, here for any narcotics
that might be collected at the scene,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a whole host of kind of processes
to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, package all found narcotics
are dangerous substances and should be in
[SPEAKER_00]: paper-isolated envelopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep drug paraphernalia in separate
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to weigh and document each type
of drug in its entirety, including the
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to conduct a presumptive test to
give you an idea of what it may be and
[SPEAKER_00]: seal the evidence tape with your initials
and your date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once packaged, you weigh them again in the
complete packaging and write the gross
[SPEAKER_00]: weight on the outside of the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, so this is important to keep that
documentation step going and those
[SPEAKER_00]: weighing going as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: For firearms packaging, we want to take
pictures before moving the firearm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a key part right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make note of the position of the bolt and
slide and chamber and hammer, where the
[SPEAKER_00]: safety is placed, the position of the
cylinder and any cartridges that are
[SPEAKER_00]: found.
[SPEAKER_00]: For handling, be sure to secure the weapon
by eliminating part of the gun from
[SPEAKER_00]: moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that evident here in these
cardboard boxes with zip ties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caution is this may not involve unloading
of the firearm.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you want to package the firearm,
you can also package it potentially in
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic, but make sure any ammunition is
packaged separately that is found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, certain requirements here for
packaging of firearms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at our trace evidence,
our hair, our fiber and our glass and
[SPEAKER_00]: other examples of trace evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically plastic bottles are used with
pressure lids because they're great
[SPEAKER_00]: options for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paper bags are a good choice for larger
objects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to avoid the mailing envelopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we kind of like those little
sealable kind of plastic containers there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different sizes, again, to match the piece
of evidence that we're specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proper techniques for liquids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, wet evidence must be
air-dried before it's put in a container
[SPEAKER_00]: because it might be altered when placed in
that container.
[SPEAKER_00]: When suspected biological evidence is
found on clothing or other absorbent
[SPEAKER_00]: surfaces, transport it to the laboratory
in an appropriate container and move the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire substance if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wet evidence should not be folded over on
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use paper wrapping to prevent
contamination during the transfer process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be air-dried thoroughly in a
drying locker and packaged in a container
[SPEAKER_00]: suitable for dried evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means avoid airtight containers to
the increased chance of mold growth over a
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This evidence may not get looked at right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the suspected biological evidence is
liquid form on a fixed surface that cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: be transported, for example, like a
concrete floor, the substance should be
[SPEAKER_00]: recovered using a dried material
collection technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way it should be removed
from the actual crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dried material, kind of moving it
through, make sure you're always using
[SPEAKER_00]: gloved hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slightly moisten a swab with distilled
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The swab should be dampened out or really
wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thoroughly rub the stain using a single
motion swab for a small stain and multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: swabs for a larger stain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air-dry the swabs and then place the swabs
in separate labeled packaging that may be
[SPEAKER_00]: placed inside a paper envelope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collect the substances, control a sample
as well from an unstained area using the
[SPEAKER_00]: same techniques, and be sure to leave a
mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Label it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see again, there's certain
techniques that are needed depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: what material you're collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certain techniques that must be
followed and be sure that you're labeling
[SPEAKER_00]: everything so that all this evidence can
not only be utilized in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: but can have that proper documentation
step so it can uphold itself in court.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
