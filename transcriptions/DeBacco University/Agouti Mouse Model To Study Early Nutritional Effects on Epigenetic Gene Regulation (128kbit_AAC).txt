[SPEAKER_00]: Despite these mice looking very
differently, they are actually genetically
[SPEAKER_00]: the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this Debaco University video,
the Agouti mouse model to study early
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritional effects and epigenetic gene
regulation will be discussed on how the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition of the mother can potentially
impact the future offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into this Agouti mouse
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a great YouTube video to kind
of go over and help explain some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to break this down so we
can relate this mouse model potentially to
[SPEAKER_00]: something that was also seen in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, since we're going to talk
about epigenetics, I'll probably describe
[SPEAKER_00]: what this actually is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And epigenetic literally means in addition
to changes in genetic sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not looking at just genetic
sequence, we're looking at additional
[SPEAKER_00]: modifications to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The term has to evolve to include the
process that alters gene activity without
[SPEAKER_00]: changing the actual DNA sequence and leads
to modifications that can be transmitted
[SPEAKER_00]: to daughter cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: There likely will continue to be debate
over exactly what the term means and what
[SPEAKER_00]: it covers, but this gives you a good
understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many types of epigenetic processes have
been identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look specifically at
methylation here and describe a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically methyl groups added to DNA
sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the epigenetic process are natural and
essential to many organisms' functions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if they occur improperly, there can be
major adverse health as well as behavioral
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts and effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps the best known epigenetic process
in part for methylation has been
[SPEAKER_00]: methylation because it's in addition to
removing the methyl groups, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to identify and it really provides
this initial investigation while other
[SPEAKER_00]: things can apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look specifically at
methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was first confirmed to occur in human
cancer in 1983, making it of utmost
[SPEAKER_00]: importance there for illnesses and health
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at this kind of example here,
well, it stems from the Second World War
[SPEAKER_00]: in the winter of 1944 to 1945.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a German blockade that caused
famine in the western provinces of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: A legacy longitudinal study five decades
later or after this had occurred showed
[SPEAKER_00]: that people born to mothers who were in
the first three months of pregnancy during
[SPEAKER_00]: the famine had significantly higher
instances of obesity, diabetes,
[SPEAKER_00]: cardiovascular disease, and cancer in
their adult lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: This led to the development of the
hypothesis called fetal susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditional genetics really couldn't
explain what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in 2003, a study conducted by two
scientists, Robert Waterland and Randy
[SPEAKER_00]: Jertle, with mice, may provide some
supporting data to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I included a citation to their study to
describe a little bit more of what they
[SPEAKER_00]: found and how it relates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fetal susceptibility hypothesis,
its traditional genetics really couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: explain what was going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the concept is that some of these
effects seen in the offspring could be
[SPEAKER_00]: connected to potentially other factors
from the prenatal stage and kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: maternal diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that famine during that critical
development time period of the fetus may
[SPEAKER_00]: have caused some developmental
modifications that then led to the
[SPEAKER_00]: predisposition to obesity and
cardiovascular diseases later in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they looked at with this
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this brings us to the agouti mice here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agouti simply means large yellow agouti
mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It demonstrated the fetal susceptibility
and opened up a new way to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genic mutations were thought to be the
cause of diseases and in some cases they
[SPEAKER_00]: can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while this may be the case,
it's not the only case that may occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at our mice here from the
title slide image and another one right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these mice are genetically
identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the phenotypes are very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at how the genotype
impacts the phenotype and vice versa here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can they have the same genes but have
very different looks or morphological
[SPEAKER_00]: features?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can relate to the kitchen analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the genome is like the recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genome contains the blueprint for
making and maintaining the organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the standard set of
instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the epigenome is the chef.
[SPEAKER_00]: When and where and how to make it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The epigenome provides the regulation of
those gene expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the chef comes in and they're going to
make decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning if they're looking at making a
breakfast, they're probably more likely
[SPEAKER_00]: going to choose the recipes for pancakes
and muffins and eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're looking at dinner, they might
choose something more in the steak,
[SPEAKER_00]: rice, and salad there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of utilizing the genome,
which is the recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The epigenome is the chef that's directing
where and when it's being utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at the importance of gene
regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Methylation comes into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the CH3 can block or turn off
or silence different genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that molecule right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the methyl groups attached right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each cell contains all of your DNA,
a few exceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, red blood cells, but look
very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think of your skin cells versus
your liver cells, very different looks,
[SPEAKER_00]: very different functions, but contain the
same genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is simply due to the expression of or
what genes are being expressed in those
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, your eye cells contain the
genetics to produce hydrochloric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's a good thing this gene is
not expressed in your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that gene is activated where it's
needed in your stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this brings nature versus nurture into
comparison as well or debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early in development, signals are given to
differentiate cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these signals are carried on as it
grows and develops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetic signals can be influenced by
environmental factors, stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: and diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this leads to environmental
epigenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: At critical stages of development,
the environmental factors can have a
[SPEAKER_00]: greater influence on the final gene
expression of the individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shortly after fertilization is a critical
time point because this is when cells
[SPEAKER_00]: first are developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Famine in those mothers, while early in
pregnancy, impacted the development of
[SPEAKER_00]: their fetus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we're looking at fertilization,
the formation of the zygote, the two-cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: the four-cell, the eight-cell stage,
very, very early on on how if something
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs during this stage, it could really
impact what genes are being expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this agouti gene, going back to this,
all mammals have the agouti gene that
[SPEAKER_00]: controls the distribution of dark pigment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And go back to our genetically identical
mice here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some brown and are brown and they stay a
normal weight their entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are the tan yellow color and they are
obese and have high instances of diabetes
[SPEAKER_00]: and cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The differences are due to changes in that
gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: The change is relative to transposon,
which is a viral segment of DNA that moves
[SPEAKER_00]: or jumps to different positions in the
genome and that can alter gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that transposon we can see here taking
that sequence and just cutting it out and
[SPEAKER_00]: moving it over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's been physically moved in space
and that's what can cause this change in
[SPEAKER_00]: gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the presence of methyl
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we have methyl groups being added or
removed, that can also affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: expression or the suppression of that
particular gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see the agouti type here in our
non-methylated groups and we see that
[SPEAKER_00]: being expressed and we see that yellow
obese and tumor causing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we see methyl groups blocking the
promoter region, blocking that gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll see that normal weight and that
brown coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's tan yellow mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The transposon physically located right
next to the agouti gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see again that same example right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: An overproduction resulting in the tan
yellow coloration and also block the
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding control center in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of two things were occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: This resulted in them being obese and this
is also inheritable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tan yellow mice have a greater percentage
of similar offspring that would become
[SPEAKER_00]: obese early and unfortunately get sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see in the neural mice that
methylation that blocking that agouti
[SPEAKER_00]: gene, normal weight, tan coloration and
that non-methyl group that gene would then
[SPEAKER_00]: be expressed leading to that yellow
coloration and that unfortunately
[SPEAKER_00]: developing higher instances of diabetes
and overweight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can the phenotype be changed
environmentally?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the tan yellow mothers were split
into two groups in the part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment and they had an experimental
group and a control group.
[SPEAKER_00]: The experimental group mouse or fed mouse
cell rich in methyl groups there which
[SPEAKER_00]: contain folic acid, chlorine, vitamin B12
and these provide methyl groups which are
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in gene regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The control group was fed just regular
mouse gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with these originally agouti mice,
when they're fed this diet, we can see a
[SPEAKER_00]: change here, a percentage change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The experimental group mothers have more
normal or brown mouse offspring compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to the control group indicating those
agouti mothers that were fed those high
[SPEAKER_00]: methyl groups, those methyl groups were
put on the genes to block that agouti gene
[SPEAKER_00]: and they resulted in more normal mice that
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is showing how the environment can
affect the gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, in that mother's diet,
again, just to reiterate it here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the incorporation of those methyl groups,
the feed essentially silenced or turned
[SPEAKER_00]: off the transposon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This results in a return to the normal
agouti gene with mice being brown and of
[SPEAKER_00]: normal weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unmethylated early in development
results in the activation of the agouti
[SPEAKER_00]: gene through the animal's entire cells and
that's continuous throughout the life in
[SPEAKER_00]: the animal always being yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once expressed early on, continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first study connect a mother's
diet to impact on the expression of the
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring's genetic code.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a breakthrough and is still
talked about even to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this leads to the epigenetics which is
the mechanism by which the environment can
[SPEAKER_00]: affect the expression of genes which can
alter disease susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obesity may be impacted by nourishment of
the mother received before the baby was
[SPEAKER_00]: even born.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what environmental factors change the
epigenome?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the genes that are being altered?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all questions that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, now we do have the tools and know
what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So several studies of the umbilical cord
of newborn babies found that lower
[SPEAKER_00]: methylated levels in the CDKN2A gene that
regulates fat cells was associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: greater fat tissue in the child at four
years old and increasing their obesity
[SPEAKER_00]: risk later in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is showing another
connection between the prenatal stage and
[SPEAKER_00]: diet and impact the mother has on the
developing fetus to how that offspring has
[SPEAKER_00]: later, traits the offspring has later in
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the research, you know,
results, what are the impacts of these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it has changed how we view the adult
disease susceptibility for some cases and
[SPEAKER_00]: has entered the term epigenetics into
vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has impacted research in nutrition,
drug discovery, infectious diseases,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genome alterations are difficult,
though CRISPR is helping with this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but epigenetics and epigenome alterations
may be easier once identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And small changes in nutrition can alter
disease susceptibility, not through
[SPEAKER_00]: alterations of the genome, but by altering
the epigenome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be more susceptible or might be
more easier to be received by the public
[SPEAKER_00]: to help their potential future offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the environmental impacts on the
genomes, environmental impacts can
[SPEAKER_00]: reprogram genetic inheritance for better
or worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're expanding this model out from
just the genes and the environment making
[SPEAKER_00]: you to the genes, the environment,
and also the epigenetics playing into this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of trifecta to make you you and to
see kind of what you may be more likely to
[SPEAKER_00]: be predisposed of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not saying family history doesn't play a
role, but family history is a part of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the environment and nutrition
and exercise and lifestyle that you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the epigenetics, as well as a
new consideration as this trifecta.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, lastly, just a counterpoint here,
during reproduction the man cells tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: go through two full cycles of
demyelination and methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that process strips of all methyl
groups and thus epigenetic information
[SPEAKER_00]: from germ and embryonic cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So germ are basically sex cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: To date, there's no evidence that
epigenetic transformations can survive two
[SPEAKER_00]: rounds of biochemical cleansing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that refers to is kind of the
image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the original, if the grandmother who
smokes is altering potentially their own
[SPEAKER_00]: epigenome, could also affect the baby that
they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the baby is developing those germ
cells at the same time and it impacts
[SPEAKER_00]: those cells, not only do we have the
original grandmother's offspring infected,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see more rupees here, but
potentially their offspring could be
[SPEAKER_00]: affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, looking at this process,
we're not looking at kind of this
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-generation jump, but definitely a
correlation here of mother to initial
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just something to keep in mind
and something for expecting mothers to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep in mind during that critical stage of
development to definitely be mindful of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition because it could have potential
impacts on your unborn child.
So thank you very much.
