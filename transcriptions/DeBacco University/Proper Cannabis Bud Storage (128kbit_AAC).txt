[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over proper
cannabis bud storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at, you know, a storage
closet here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the same parameters apply to
cannabis because again, we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping the product that we've produced to
kind of keep that shelf life as long as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible and the quality as high for as
long as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So storage, use an airtight container to
preserve the aroma, taste, and potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the airtight container can kind of be
like the sealable Tupperware container.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be this little pop top here or it
can be canning jars here, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: another great option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind we do want to be keeping
whatever we're storing away from as much
[SPEAKER_00]: light and adverse conditions as possible
to again, extend that shelf life and
[SPEAKER_00]: potency as long as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some storage options, vacuum sealed
bags and canning jars are great options.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, be sure the container they are in
is airtight to avoid moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: infiltration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can be a vacuum kind of pack here
which typically is used for meat products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be used for leafy greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Key part there is to eliminate moisture
from getting in or escaping, keeping those
[SPEAKER_00]: interior conditions very consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the temperature they should be stored
at, dried buds can be stored at reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures because this will reduce the
temperature, will help preserve the
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: By reducing that temperature, you increase
inversely, you increase the storage time
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically refrigeration temperatures is
advised, four degrees Fahrenheit or four
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting away from those really warm
growing conditions, but not necessarily in
[SPEAKER_00]: the conditions where it's really freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just those cool conditions, four degrees
Fahrenheit or so for refrigeration can
[SPEAKER_00]: help increase that shelf life and ensure
your cannabis buds that you've worked so
[SPEAKER_00]: hard for are stored in the proper
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
