[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over something that many
[SPEAKER_00]: people probably recognize, the 0.3 THC
legal level between this distinction
[SPEAKER_00]: between marijuana and hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, and I'm going to talk about why
that 0.3% THC legal limit for hemp is
[SPEAKER_00]: technically flawed looking at the original
data that was used as part of the study as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as some new data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So join me on this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something many growers are very
well aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.3% over or under that level for THC
creates a major different distinguish in
[SPEAKER_00]: their end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's go over why that number is
actually flawed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, this is the original
research article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was published in 1976.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you the link here and
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pull out certain excerpts
from that article so we can take a look at
[SPEAKER_00]: them in a little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the kind of, you can trace it
all back to this original article,
[SPEAKER_00]: why we have that 0.3 THC level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk about why it's
flawed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, that 0.3 THC legal limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the level that is the make or
break point if a cannabis plant is to be
[SPEAKER_00]: classified as either hemp or marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be the determining factor to
basically determine if the plant material
[SPEAKER_00]: can be sold or is a federal crime,
at least in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did this number come to be the
standard?
[SPEAKER_00]: What made them choose this particular THC
level?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a story behind the number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's kind of the great
distinguishing factor is everything is
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, whether we're talking about hemp
or marijuana here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 0.3% THC limit is so well
established, looking into the supporting
[SPEAKER_00]: literature to how it came about reveals a
very interesting story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire basis for this set point is
based off only one article, the one cited
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes reviewing the data much
easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a ton of articles to look
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one particular one to investigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, once we do this investigation,
the details might be a bit shocking to
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, here's the excerpt from the
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have different quotes from
that article here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to highlight certain points from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, it will be noted that we and
we, so who is we talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is the two people responsible
for the publication of the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ernest Small and Arthur John Conquist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We is both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one from the Ernest Small is from the
Biosystenics Research Institute,
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture in Canada, particularly
Ottawa, Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Arthur John was from the New York
Botanical Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this article is only composed of two
scientists or authors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not saying that only two people
can't produce quality work, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: research base is certainly smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then one would assume for this only
article really being utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to just make a note that these
two individuals were not the ones that put
[SPEAKER_00]: this into the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were merely the ones that published
this article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others then chose to use this article as
the sole source for the implementation of
[SPEAKER_00]: their laws and rulings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we is referring to two scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then part two, we arbitrarily adopt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So arbitrarily adopt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that in a scientific article.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't be a little concerning there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So arbitrarily means in a way that it's
based on chance rather than being planned
[SPEAKER_00]: or based on reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And adopt is to accept or start to use
something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So roughly translated 0.3% THC level is
based on chance more than reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And will be used starting now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now is 1976, the year the article was
published.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's even more to this as we
continue to investigate further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look a little bit further down in
the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: We arbitrarily adopt that 0.3% delta 9 THC
concentration on a dry basis in young
[SPEAKER_00]: vigorous leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the flower concentration was not even
considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the young vigorous leaves of
relatively, in quotes, mature plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not exactly sure what their degree
of maturity is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we talking about this degree of
maturity kind of over here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we talking about this degree of
maturity over here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see there's distinct visual
differences there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part here is they were looking at
the vigorous leaves is what they were
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring for THC content, not the actual
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going on a little bit further in the
article as well, those young upper leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So upper leaves are the source of plant
material tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to testing final product
nowadays, the final product that is being
[SPEAKER_00]: tested is the dry flower, not the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're basing our information on an
article that was testing the leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the actual flower components there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a major difference in
distinction there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this brings apart another article here,
which is unrelated to the ruling,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I want to kind of bring this into
light in this discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an article published in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find all the information here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pull up some information from
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were looking at the accumulation
of the delta 9 concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just saw here, we're using for our
laws, articles based on testing the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, accumulation of delta 9 in two
chemist varieties here, sour willy and
[SPEAKER_00]: bonita tree at days posted here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're looking at the THC
concentration of the flower versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see that the flower is
notably higher than the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So panels A and C, these two right below
me right there, report averages with a
[SPEAKER_00]: total of three plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta 9 THC levels and flora samples is
the solid line and leaf samples is the
[SPEAKER_00]: dotted line.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does show some of the variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: B and D, what is the two panels that are
basically below me right now, report the
[SPEAKER_00]: delta 9 and the leaves or flora samples
from the top of the plant and the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we know, higher up in the plant,
you can have higher levels, lower where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not getting quite as much light
intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be lower delta 9 levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take this even a step further
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at some of the actual data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to have to make myself kind
of small here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to completely disappear on
you, but I'm just going to put myself
[SPEAKER_00]: right in the middle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the side over here, so we're
looking at leaf cannabinoid content in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants cultivated in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So draw your attention here to the column
all the way on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is looking at the delta 9
concentration of the actual leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking on this other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here is the inflorescence or the
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the delta 9
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across many different varieties here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the lowest level of delta 9 THC here
is 3.03%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the highest level here in the leaves
is 2.69% with a little variability there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and we can see much lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, leaves compared to actual flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a great distinction in the
different concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, these are the same varieties
are mixed up here because they're ordered
[SPEAKER_00]: based on delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So direct quote from this article now,
the more updated one, they were looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: delta 9 THC levels in the leaf tissues
were generally at least tenfold lower
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to that of the actual,
you know, inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some variability as expected,
but in general, tenfold lower
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration THC levels in the leaves
compared to the flowers based on this
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that original article was testing
the leaves, not actually even the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at, you know,
why the 0.3 THC legal limit for hemp is
[SPEAKER_00]: flawed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what's the real basis behind
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully this data and information
brings that to light that there's current
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation of 0.3 THC as the federal
limit, but this is based on data known not
[SPEAKER_00]: to be represented of practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original article's arbitrary selected
that level for testing for this is based
[SPEAKER_00]: on the leaves, which are shown to be at
least a tenfold lower than the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So currently flowers are tested and the
percentage of THC to determine the
[SPEAKER_00]: classification is based on data generated
at random and actually from leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does this really make any sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of how I bring that apart that
just, it's basically a flawed value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I take this another step forward,
with the data presented, this would
[SPEAKER_00]: support the federal limit of 0.3% THC
level to going up to a 3% THC level from
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's maybe 10 times the current
level based on the data, it would suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: this would be representative of what's
being tested, the flower, compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: current rules article based on the testing
of the leaves there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were to take the original article
that was testing the leaves and set that
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.3% level, with the flower typically
being 10% more, well, 10 times greater,
[SPEAKER_00]: 3% would be the actual flower
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why would 3%, what would this allow?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if we did, you know,
go up to 3% in the actual flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: what would this allow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the major advantage would offer is a
more reasonable threshold to increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of potential cannabis types that
can be used as hemp based production.
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.3% THC level really limits the gene pool
that a lot of growers have access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would reduce the current limits on
CBD production as to increase levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, often THC will have some degree of
increase as well in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research could be conducted on low level
THC for potential interaction benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: with CBD and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though I do end with the endpoint here
that I do want to just, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: over here is caution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be taken for any user of any new
product that will enter the body at any
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're going to use that original
article and really look at it that was
[SPEAKER_00]: testing the leaves, we want to expand that
out to the flower with the research I
[SPEAKER_00]: showed is 10% more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would support a 3% THC limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not saying that's the ideal limit to
choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to provide everyone with
background information on exactly where
[SPEAKER_00]: that 0.3% THC level was derived from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why that number is actually flawed.
0.3% THC.
