[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ever looked at the sidewall of a
tire, you may have seen a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: letters and numbers and thought they were
just random.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to go over tire sidewall
decoding and we're going to develop an
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding for what those numbers and
letters actually mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, here's a quick breakdown of
just kind of an example of a sidewall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can tell you Department of
Transportation, Canadian Manufacture and
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant Code, the tire size, manufacturer
identity number, week and year the tire
[SPEAKER_00]: was made.
[SPEAKER_00]: All good, valuable information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, that decoding process,
what does it actually look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it involve?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the Department of Transportation
number known as the DOT number consists
[SPEAKER_00]: of, and this is just an example,
the DOT impression, the plant code,
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer, date of manufacture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind that tires made after
January 1st, the year 2000, have four
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers in the last group.
[SPEAKER_00]: While prior to that, there are only three
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can again help determine just on a
large scale where that tire may have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally made, they all follow this same
general pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go through and break this
down a little bit further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Retread Tires, DOT number decoding is
slightly different than a just regular
[SPEAKER_00]: tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that the Retread Tires
have a slightly different numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have something called DOTR,
Department of Transportation Retread,
[SPEAKER_00]: or R indicates that it's a retread tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see that R, it's going to be
indicating that this is a retread.
[SPEAKER_00]: YPY is manufacturer retread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goodyear Retread in Canada, this was where
this was manufactured.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it can tell you with that code,
or at least identifying that code,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can then go to a conversion to tell you
exactly where that was particularly made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have the date and year of
manufacture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're looking at something that is a
1201, that would indicate it was made in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 12th week of the year 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an example here of 0802, this tire was
manufactured in the eighth week of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: So common tire designations that we see
here, again, the same kind of indication
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: P stands for passenger tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: This 185, or in this example here,
195, is the approximate width of the tire
[SPEAKER_00]: measured in millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: 65 is the aspect ratio R stands for radial
tire, and 15 is the rim diameter in
[SPEAKER_00]: inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a little confusing that measures
one thing in millimeters and another thing
[SPEAKER_00]: in inches, but these are just what these
numbers correlate with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we take this tire and kind of break
it down into a little bit more specifics,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll take a look and see and decode this
sidewall here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we see the P. Well,
P stands for passenger tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these tires are often called P-metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that the LT stands for light truck,
ST stands for special trail, and T would
[SPEAKER_00]: stand for temporary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, we see a P. This is a
passenger tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: The absence of a letter at the beginning
of the size description indicates that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a Euro-metric tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 225, so we see here, the 225
represents the approximate section width,
[SPEAKER_00]: or width of the tire from sidewall to
sidewall, again, measured in millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larger the number, simply put,
the wider the tire is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 60, 60 refers to the aspect ratio,
which is the nominal sidewall height
[SPEAKER_00]: reflected as a percentage section width.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sidewall height of this tire is 60%
of 225, or approximately 135 millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: R here, R stands for radial construction,
which is the industry standard for
[SPEAKER_00]: passenger cars and light truck tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: A, B, or X, and the placement of R would
indicate the tire has a bias or ply
[SPEAKER_00]: construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 16 is the rim or bead diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 represents in inches, keep in mind,
the diameter of the beads, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: that this tire is designed to fit on a rim
with a 16-inch diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 97V is a service description.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this final component, the size
designates, is called a service
[SPEAKER_00]: description, indicates the load index and
the speed symbol of the tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So load index of 97, in this example,
is a two or three-digit code that
[SPEAKER_00]: represents the maximum load the tire can
be carried at speed, indicated by the
[SPEAKER_00]: speed symbol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, again, getting into a little
bit more of the specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why when you're choosing a
tire for your vehicle, depending what tire
[SPEAKER_00]: it is, there's a lot of options provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not just all tires, 60-inch tires,
anything will do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of specialty descriptions to
keep in mind to maximize the performance
[SPEAKER_00]: and match the performance of your
particular vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, here's the full sidewall
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of gives you just that
general summary there, everything that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've described here, how it looks on a
tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I invite you to go out, look at the
sidewall of any tire, and if you have one
[SPEAKER_00]: in the parking lot, if you go to a parking
lot, just take a look, and hopefully you
[SPEAKER_00]: can, with this video, describe a little
bit or develop an understanding of what
[SPEAKER_00]: those numbers and letters actually tell
you about the specifics for the tire
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at.
