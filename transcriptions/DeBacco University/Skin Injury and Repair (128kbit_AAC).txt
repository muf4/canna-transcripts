[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this video is going to look at skin
injury and repair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And below in the description, you'll see
some links to some sources where I pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the images from, some great other
slideshows to take a look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to warn you the next slide here
is going to show some burn injuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the images may be considered
graphic, so viewer discretion is advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting to that skin injury,
looking at burns classified by severity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first degree burns only the upper part
of the dermis is damaged, kind of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: sunburn here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second degree burns are upper part of the
dermis is also damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blisters can appear, skin heals a little
scarring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third degree burns are more severe,
and they consume the thickness of the
[SPEAKER_00]: skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burning area appears white, red,
or black, and you can see it sadly on this
[SPEAKER_00]: person's foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also fourth degree burns,
which I chose not to show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you an idea of first being the
most mild, second being in the middle,
[SPEAKER_00]: and third being the most severe in this
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does this skin go about repairing
itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we have an injury, we're going to
look at a cut injury, because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably more common.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should probably get, sadly,
more often than you'd like to admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bleeding occurs at the site of injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Immediately after the injury, the mast
cells in the region trigger an
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammatory response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's our first part here.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, this cut goes pretty down deep into
the dermal layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got bleeding occurring,
and we have things rushing to this site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ministry might put a bandage over
just to try to stop the bleeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: After several hours, a scab should begin
to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are cells migrating to the edges
of the wound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's phagocytotic cells that remove
debris.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to clean this up, because we have
an injury now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacteria could get in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have an area of cleaning that
up, this debris.
[SPEAKER_00]: More cells arriving with enhanced
circulation to the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it may feel warm and get red,
because you have more blood going to that
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clotting around the edges of the affected
area partially isolates the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the body wants to eliminate bacteria
from getting into the body, because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a wound site here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to force a scab region to seal
the region off, increase blood flow to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow exchange of things and allow things
being brought there, and try to isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: this region at least a little bit to try
to limit the potential for damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on, after about a week of the
injury, the scab has been undermined by
[SPEAKER_00]: epithelial cells, as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're migrating over this meshwork
produced by the fibroblast activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice that the scab is still located at
the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our phagocytotic activity around the site
is almost ended, and fibrin clot is being
[SPEAKER_00]: disintegrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're noticing this transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned that the scab is still present
at the top here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though you may not think things
are going on, there's a lot going on below
[SPEAKER_00]: in that dermal layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why if you pick out a scab and
remove this, you're kind of re-causing
[SPEAKER_00]: some injury site here, and you're not
allowing the wound to have a sealed
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, that could cause longer
wound healing time if you remove this
[SPEAKER_00]: scab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to let it naturally kind of fall
off, because your body is working from the
[SPEAKER_00]: deeper dermal layer up through the dermal
layer to the surface here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's starting deep in the dermal layer
and working its way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: After several weeks, again, this is a more
severe cut, the scab has been shed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It falls off naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe once it kind of gets itchy,
kind of your body trying to get to remove
[SPEAKER_00]: it, and the epidermis is complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: A shallow depression though marks the
injury site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fibroblast here, and the dermal continue
to create scar tissue that will gradually
[SPEAKER_00]: elevate the overlaying epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there still may be scar tissue present
and left over a long period of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're noticing that for the most part,
function has returned normally to the skin
[SPEAKER_00]: in the dermal region here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now freezing that sealed barrier,
continue on even though there may still be
[SPEAKER_00]: that marked left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep this in mind when you get a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want to pick up your scabs,
let it kind of naturally fall off to allow
[SPEAKER_00]: the body time to be to go through this
stepwise process to heal itself for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term repair.
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
