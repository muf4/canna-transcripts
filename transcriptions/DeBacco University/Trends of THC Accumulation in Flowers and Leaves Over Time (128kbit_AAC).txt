[SPEAKER_00]: In this Debaco University video,
I'm going to be going over trends in THC
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation in flowers and leaves over
time, looking at some data to see how this
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid accumulates in different parts
of the plants over a period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the trends of
THC accumulation in flowers and leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, this is the research article
that I'm basing the information on,
[SPEAKER_00]: so welcome to take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just providing a brief summary
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the time course for accumulation of
delta 9 THC in flowers in medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So floral and leaf samples were collected
from two strains that they looked at here
[SPEAKER_00]: at multiple intervals during the flower
induction stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant material was collected from
greenhouse grown plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The accumulation of the delta 9 THC in
these samples was determinedly presented
[SPEAKER_00]: here in graphical form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do those graphs kind of look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's what we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the same sour willy variety here,
looking at that accumulation of our delta
[SPEAKER_00]: 9.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have the leaf, here we have the
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, on our Y axis, we have the delta
9 THC percent dry weight in both examples,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we have days post flower
induction here on the X axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Letter A, this kind of graph here,
what this is showing, this report,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the average of three plants for delta 9
THC levels in floral samples is the solid
[SPEAKER_00]: line, and leaf samples here is the dotted
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Panel B over here is showing the delta 9
THC in floral samples from the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, which is the solid line,
and the bottom of the plant, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: dotted line.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're noticing overall is that the
leaf stays pretty stable and doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really accumulate a whole lot overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flower does increase over time,
but we can see that there's also some
[SPEAKER_00]: great variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking here at the higher portions of the
plant leaves versus the lower portions,
[SPEAKER_00]: seems like the higher portions tend to
accumulate a little bit more, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the end here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're noticing a little bit of a pickup
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the other variety that they looked at,
make myself a little smaller, same basic
[SPEAKER_00]: idea here, same basic kind of data
collection trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see definitely that flower is a
little bit more variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, trending upwards as it
progresses, and the leaf really not a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole lot, and upper leaves having more
delta 9 THC accumulation than lower
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both showing a little bit of an increase,
a little bit of this bump up here from day
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 to day 55.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that THC content we're looking at,
the content of these samples from both
[SPEAKER_00]: strains increased in floral samples with
increasing time post-induction.
[SPEAKER_00]: In leaf samples, delta 9 THC levels
decreased slightly during the same period.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we saw there, relatively the same,
if we just look here again, relatively the
[SPEAKER_00]: same, but it does have a slight decrease
here, definitely not as dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we saw with the change in the flower
there, there's an increase in those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the content variability, well,
considerable variation of the delta 9 THC
[SPEAKER_00]: content in floral samples at each time
point collection was noted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to show that with the large error
bars there on the graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple flowers were collected from
different parts of the plant to generate
[SPEAKER_00]: an average.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now THC content related to location on the
actual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, floral samples from the top or high
portion of the plant can have higher
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of delta 9 THC than floral samples
from lower portions of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can kind of correlate with the
amount of light they're getting exposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the lower buds down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why some growers choose pruning
methods that try to get as many buds kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of pointed towards the light there as
possible, try to maximize their
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid production in those floral
parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a consistent pattern of accumulation
was observed in the sense that the same
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern of accumulation was observed in
two additional strains, as presented in
[SPEAKER_00]: the research, increasing the biological
replication of this observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The delta 9 THC content was highest in
flowers in the upper third, lowest in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers from the lower third, and
intermediate in flowers in the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: third, to kind of give you that idea that
you're gonna have the greatest amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, middle amount, and then your lowest
amount if you're looking at really trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to prime and pick that prime flower for
the highest levels of cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of data here provides you
kind of an extra incentive to keep those
[SPEAKER_00]: buds pointed towards the light to maximize
that cannabinoid production there for you.
Thank you.
