[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we'll look at the process of
gel electrophoresis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This takes the DNA fragments that are
multiplied through the process of PCR,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I have another video on that,
and separating them through literally a
[SPEAKER_00]: gel-like substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is separating out those DNA
fragments based on their relative size to
[SPEAKER_00]: one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where this may be used, we can
typically see this being used potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: for paternity tests, forensic science,
things like that, or how they determine
[SPEAKER_00]: who the father is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This process could be used for this
purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the basic setup looks like in the lab
is a gel and a power source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're using electricity to
separate out the DNA, we need a power
[SPEAKER_00]: source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the power source.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA actually has a negative charge on its
backbone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows us to have a positive charge
located here, and that will actually pull
[SPEAKER_00]: the DNA down through the gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice here the larger fragments kind
of stay closer to where we initially put
[SPEAKER_00]: the well here for our DNA, and then the
smaller fragments are actually traveling
[SPEAKER_00]: further through the gel material and
getting closer to that positive charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gel electrophoresis, again,
looking at our molecular size,
[SPEAKER_00]: which BP stands for base pairs,
and we could see here the distance
[SPEAKER_00]: migrated, the greater the distance
migrated, the smaller the molecular size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that evident here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our marker, which is just an area
where we have known fragments of DNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're seeing it separated out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping in mind those smaller base pairs,
only 100 base pairs are going further than
[SPEAKER_00]: those at 900 or 1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA is cut with restriction enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a video also on restriction
enzymes that you may want to take a look
[SPEAKER_00]: at, and it's cutting the DNA at very
specific sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has many applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such as forensics, paternity testing,
medical diagnosis, evolutionary
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships, and many more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So comparing the cut-up DNA, how are the
fragments compared?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are the fragments separated?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually separate based on their
size, and their base pair length is
[SPEAKER_00]: specific how we're looking at size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run through a gel substance, and you can
see here it is literally gel-like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like initially, when we look
at the straight lines, it looks like they
[SPEAKER_00]: all ran into the same spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, that is just the dye,
and that is what we call the gel front.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just showing you basically the
furthest that the dye has moved through
[SPEAKER_00]: that gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an idea where the fragments are
moving, but there will be little lines
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and we have ways of marking them and
indicating where those bands may be
[SPEAKER_00]: located.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned that DNA had a negative
charge, and it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: That negative charge comes from the
oxygen, which is on our phosphor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nothing to do with the nucleotide
bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to do with the sugar backbone,
and particularly the oxygens on the
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphate backbone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's causing the negative charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice here, this is a gel right on its
side, and we have our positive charge
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and our negative charge down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we add our solution of different
DNA fragments, we add them to the well,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the larger ones are not able to
run as far.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're bigger, and they kind of get
caught up in this gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller ones are able to run further
or closer to this positive charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the smaller they are, the further down
the gels are going to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's significant swimming through gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger ones are going to have a harder
time, and they're not going to move quite
[SPEAKER_00]: as far.
[SPEAKER_00]: How this looks, how we compare these
fragments, well, I mentioned this DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: ladder.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller piece is moving further.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larger piece is moving slower and lag
behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DNA ladder is loaded into one of the
gels.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that ladder is, is there's an image
of it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has known DNA base pair lengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know what bands it's going to
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows us to compare our unknown,
or even our known segments, to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: how many base pairs long they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same process here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fill the well up with the ladder.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller ones will run to the end,
and the larger ones will run more towards
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is evident here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 1,000 base pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's 500 base pairs, and here's 100 base
pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're loading that actual gel,
there are actually depressions in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're loading that mixture of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to load these slowly so no sample
is lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very small area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that we fill that
with our sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shows it kind of on the side here,
filling up that sample on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful not to lose any.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see another well right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, that's going to cause a
reduction in the amount of sample that
[SPEAKER_00]: could run through that gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic process, they can be vertical or
horizontal, those gels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking our sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here contains our DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take our micropipette.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're adding it to the wells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We add a charge to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's simply over time allowing
it to separate out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's important to not run it too long
as far as time goes, because literally all
[SPEAKER_00]: of your samples will run out of the gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to run it so they all separate,
but so they don't leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep them in the gel so you're
able to compare them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Running a gel, the DNA is cut with
restriction enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's giving the different
fragments or different sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: To stain the DNA with ethidium bromide,
it binds to the DNA, and it's fluorescent
[SPEAKER_00]: under UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what causes it to glow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ethidium bromide, remember it binds
with DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can cause mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you always want to be wearing
gloves when working with ethidium bromide.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes it really neat is that it
causes DNA to glow under UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what causes these nice little
bright bars or lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is indicating the size and the
relative position of those DNA fragments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the smaller ones will move further
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller ones will move further.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larger ones will stay closer to the
actual well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When using a lab, take extreme caution if
using this, because it does mutate your
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take a picture of this with very
special cameras and be able to tell us a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're comparing samples, we can develop
a DNA fingerprint, which is another video.
