[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to go over the lollipop printing
[SPEAKER_00]: method to maximize the light exposure to
your plant's leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the lollipop printing
method for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what are we doing with the
lollipop method?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're enhancing the top buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visually the lollipop plants have bare
stems with no foliage towards the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to a lollipop stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that evident right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lollipopping is a pruning technique that
enhances the buds at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: This works well with growers also planning
on the screen of green pruning method,
[SPEAKER_00]: helps really train those branches and
eliminate any lower leaves to help air
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation and also just plant
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result is to maximize the bud size of
those apical buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be done also with autoflowers as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not just sativa or indica dominant
strains can also be done with autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's happening is, as I said,
we're trying to maximize that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: light use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lollipopping allows for the greatest light
intensity to be utilized by the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: is accomplished by removing growth up to a
certain point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that certain point is determined by
the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we can see all these leaves kind of
clean, removed, maximizing the light
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure of the leaves up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see that evident in the plants
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the lower leaves kind of cleared out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here they though they went a couple fewer
nodes up the plant before they started not
[SPEAKER_00]: removing leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here they went a little higher and again
that's grower choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pruning method though will focus the
light energy being efficiently captured
[SPEAKER_00]: and stored by the apical buds and simply
the goal is to maximize the bud size and
[SPEAKER_00]: also the quality of the buds produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how do you go about doing this method?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well a lollipop pruning method should be
initiated, initially kind of completed two
[SPEAKER_00]: to three days before the plants are
flipped into a flowering photo period or
[SPEAKER_00]: it can even be done a little bit before
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you want to start by removing
unnecessary lower foliage that is heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: shaded simply it's not getting enough
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to determine if it's not getting
enough light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well you check with a PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This ensures growers can know the light
intensity that actually is within the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically the entire branches are not
removed unless there are some they are
[SPEAKER_00]: short and not reaching the main light
intensity to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically the branches are kept so the
leaves that are removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general growers should focus their
timing, their trimming efforts and their
[SPEAKER_00]: timing and for five or more nodes below
the top or apical meristem of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to prune way up to just the
very tibdy top.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do want to allow some portion of canopy
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again trimming there about five or more
nodes below the top is a good starting
[SPEAKER_00]: point for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now lollipopping is not the same as
defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes both do involve moving leaves so
that is true but lollipopping focuses on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom part of the plant with a focus
on removing growth that receives minimal
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically lollipopping favors the
apical or top buds while defoliation
[SPEAKER_00]: really does not prioritize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Defoliation is just removing leaves not
really in an organized format per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lollipopping is really focusing on those
that are not getting the light intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: taking those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very directed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now common method here is lollipopping is
completely done as part of a complete
[SPEAKER_00]: pruning or training program.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example lollipopping in the screen of
green tend to go hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're trying to maximize all
those branches out on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result that lower portion is not
getting very much light and you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve your air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're maximizing your light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you're also increasing your air
circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why lollipopping and screen of
green typically are done together even
[SPEAKER_00]: though each can kind of be done
independently.
