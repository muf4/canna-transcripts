[SPEAKER_00]: On this Tobacco University video,
we're going to go over some specifics
[SPEAKER_00]: regarding dry trimming so you can have a
better understanding of what this process
[SPEAKER_00]: is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the process of
dry trimming cannabis plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, dry trimming just in general
requires more space, but allows growers to
[SPEAKER_00]: carry out the trimming process over a
period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say more space, that's compared to
wet trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dry trimming process involves cutting
the plant down and then drying it to
[SPEAKER_00]: desired moisture content is achieved,
at which point the actual trimming process
[SPEAKER_00]: can therefore begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're hanging the plants in this
example, letting them dry out,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you're going to go through a
trimming process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the benefits to dry trim?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some of the benefits when trimming
dry are plants are cut down and then
[SPEAKER_00]: dried, so while the process will take a
little longer, again, compared to wet
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming, the terpenes will be preserved
to a greater degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the trichomes will harden during the
drying process, which is when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming results in a cleaner process for
the person doing the actual trimming,
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual manual process of going through
or kind of going through moving,
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting, and kind of getting them to that
final finished end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the problems with dry trimming,
because there is no perfect method,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that with dry trimming, there's
increased risk of trichome damage while
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming simply because they're more
fragile when those trichomes are dried
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to when they're freshly harvested
or wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also mean growers need to take
extra care when it comes to handling the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds during the trimming process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers also need the space to hang their
plants to allow them to dry for what could
[SPEAKER_00]: take a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, you're looking at hopefully
under two weeks, but again, it can depend
[SPEAKER_00]: on your specific drying location and the
volume of plant material and ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: control that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for commercial harvests, when you dry
your harvest and then trim, you'll achieve
[SPEAKER_00]: a higher quality with a longer,
slower drying period, which preserves
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes better.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the main reasons why a lot
of growers elect to do a dry trim,
[SPEAKER_00]: despite the need for hanging plant
material and the time to wait for it to
[SPEAKER_00]: dry that is considered to be advantageous
simply because of a higher quality end
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while this process can be mechanized,
there's still potential for physical
[SPEAKER_00]: damage to the trichomes with this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, the end product will be of higher
quality, again, when compared to wet
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming, as long as there is space to
allow for proper drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that higher quality is the main reason
why most growers will select to go through
[SPEAKER_00]: the extra challenges that dry trimming
kind of lends itself to, because once all
[SPEAKER_00]: those challenges are met, the end product
will be superior and that's ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: what's gonna drive and hopefully get an
increased dollar amount for the end
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
So, thanks for watching and have a great
day.
