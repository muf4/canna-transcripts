[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, here in this Tobacco University
video, we're going to be exploring
[SPEAKER_00]: phenohunting limitations in regards to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while phenohunting is done quite
frequently with many plant types,
[SPEAKER_00]: including cannabis, I'm going to mention
some of the limitations if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: deciding to go down this particular route.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, phenohunting is the basis
for selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers have been breeding based on
phenotypes for generations and it still
[SPEAKER_00]: works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is performed to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not something that's just
completely going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to be aware of some of the
limitations when you do selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, with advancements and other
techniques, there are more refined methods
[SPEAKER_00]: for the selection process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can help speed up the process and
allow growers to start looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: different aspects or characteristics of
plants that may not have been possible
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, with any form of growing,
with any form of plant production,
[SPEAKER_00]: documentation is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be tracking individual
selection progression and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: environments that they're grown in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All are important tools to aid in the
selection process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can, just looking at here,
we have the date, we have the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have the dredge-ups made, any notes,
we have some actual samples of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure to kind of document the process
because that will help you as a grower be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to refine your techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also have an idea of what traits you are
breeding for as this will help the always
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging selection process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might see something, you might have to
change your plans, but at least go into
[SPEAKER_00]: with some idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or some direction as far as what you
ideally want to be breeding for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing the environment is also a key
factor there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when phenohunting, the environment has
a great influence on the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this needs to be taken into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because something performs well,
it does not mean it will always perform
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: By knowing the particular conditions that
it did perform well in, that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful to the grower or breeder that
might be selecting that variety or letting
[SPEAKER_00]: others grow that variety as far as knowing
what conditions it may prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like to get the maximum production out
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a prime example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at bonsai tree hunters,
looking at different phenotype selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, bonsai tree hunters thought they hit
the premise land when they went to the
[SPEAKER_00]: beach and found dwarf types of common
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dwarf types were becoming very popular in
certain times.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when they brought those trees
that were very dwarf in appearance back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the greenhouses to breed them out,
they thought they found some unique
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They brought those to the greenhouses and
they found all the plants grew essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why was this the case at plants that
were definitely smaller in dwarf?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did they grow normally?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this was because the plants were
dwarf due to the environmental stresses
[SPEAKER_00]: such as water, salt and wind that those
plants were exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once given the more normal or
favorable growing conditions, they then
[SPEAKER_00]: changed their performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we see the same example here with
here's a bonsai tree in a very small
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a tree growing in a parking lot
with a very limited root base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a tree growing that has a much
more expansive root base.
[SPEAKER_00]: While these all may be the same,
variety or type of tree, we can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: they can produce vastly different results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing we met to this extreme
level can also be seen in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you also need to consider what is
happening inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: While you may be breeding and making
selections, growers really do not know
[SPEAKER_00]: what the genetics of their plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Establishing the basic lineage can help
provide an idea, but once the final end
[SPEAKER_00]: product is produced, it may be wise to get
a genetic screen or profile done to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine just how different the new
creation may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not meant to be a letdown,
but if you think you're breeding something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really different and unique,
at least phenotypically, at least what you
[SPEAKER_00]: can physically see, we need to that kind
of end result or more towards those end
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you really think you have something
unique, getting it genetically screened or
[SPEAKER_00]: profiled might be advantageous,
really just to see how unique that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: actually may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it really different and unique or is it
really something that is an influence of
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment and really hasn't changed
any of the genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to kind of know that before you
start mass producing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's spreading it out everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's related to your environmental
growing conditions or if you really have
[SPEAKER_00]: some very unique genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining us.
