[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tobacco University video we're
going to go over how to identify and
[SPEAKER_00]: control Fusarium in cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: While Fusarium is considered to be a
soil-borne disease we can see it infects
[SPEAKER_00]: the stems as well as upper portions of the
plant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think it's only isolated to the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go over how to identify and
control Fusarium in cannabis plants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off the identification of
[SPEAKER_00]: Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see the wilted appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see that kind of right at the soil
line, that discoloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we cut into the stem we're going to
see kind of this kind of brownish
[SPEAKER_00]: coloration as the plant gets into the
internal components of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physical damage by a mechanical insect or
nematodes to the roots can also increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the severity and rate of spread of
Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as if it grow overwaters plants or
plants receive excess nitrogen this can
[SPEAKER_00]: also cause them to be more prone to
Fusarium infections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note this is a common occurrence when high
amounts of compost have been added to a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant as this does increase the water
holding capacity as well as typically the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen and that will encourage Fusarium
to proliferate in that site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now word of caution with Fusarium is that
the infection of female buds and grains is
[SPEAKER_00]: a serious and underestimated disease that
may result in contamination by Fusarium
[SPEAKER_00]: mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell has found contamination of hemp
grain to exceed seven parts per million of
[SPEAKER_00]: this ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that while it's a root
disease can affect upper portions of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, can cause mycotoxins to develop,
can cause some severe issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't think it's only limited just to
the root section of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the general life cycle of Fusarium
it's important to understand a life cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: because where you can break that life
cycle, interrupt it in some way might be a
[SPEAKER_00]: way you could reduce severity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we're looking at our life cycle
those kind of small little portions those
[SPEAKER_00]: germinating spores penetrating the lateral
roots causing it to kind of proliferate
[SPEAKER_00]: causing it to get into the internal
structure of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see that occurring while those
wound areas are just encouraging that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're getting into the vesicles of the
plant, particularly the xylem which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: water transporting vesicles of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes through, it really clogs
the xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we saw that kind of brown
image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brown image is because all those little
Fusarium spores are in there clogging up
[SPEAKER_00]: the xylem, limiting the water transport
causing the plant to wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it proliferates from there,
it breaks out, can get on the leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: can then spread and break off,
get back into the soil, proliferate there
[SPEAKER_00]: and then kind of repeat the cycle again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind this Fusarium,
think about it's initially affecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots but really affects a lot of portions
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you go about controlling it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well indoor and outdoor applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these we could look at on other
plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pseudomonas strains have several
endophytes such as trichoderma strains
[SPEAKER_00]: have offered better control than
mycorrhizae fungi, bacillus and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-pathogenic Fusarium strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pseudomonas or trichodermas might
be worth investigating its biological
[SPEAKER_00]: controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one product, this is another
product that is contained in trichoderma
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing chemists in an outdoor
location on a large scale, may not be as
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous to apply these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crop rotations that have some
effectiveness if levels are initially low
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're first identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incorporating mustard cover crop can help
but really if you identify it specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: as Fusarium, you might want to look at the
cover crop called hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has shown suppression of Fusarium in
fields planted with watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: To eliminate field to field transfer via
tools and equipment, you want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not transferring soil either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eliminate soil transfers, you're not
infecting multiple fields if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant maybe some hairy vetch to get some
nitrogen benefit as well as suppress
[SPEAKER_00]: Fusarium in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also some biological controls
that exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go also identify early to try to suppress
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Key part being if possible if you identify
an area that does have Fusarium,
[SPEAKER_00]: rotate out, give that soil a rest,
plant some cover crops and then come back
[SPEAKER_00]: later with your crop of choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
