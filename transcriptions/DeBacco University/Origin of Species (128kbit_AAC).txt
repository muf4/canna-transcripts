[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to dive a little bit
more into Charles Darwin's book,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Origin of Species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of his most famous works,
at least in the modern day, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: when it was first published compared to
the book he did on earthworms,
[SPEAKER_00]: the earthworm book, not only was he more
proud of, but it sold better than this
[SPEAKER_00]: Origin of Species.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, now we're able to realize and
look at this and are diving more into it
[SPEAKER_00]: with a little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's an interesting point of note of
this Origin of Species is that he drafted
[SPEAKER_00]: the Clonidate Transcript back in 1842.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, he shelved it and didn't really
refer to it for 16 years, probably because
[SPEAKER_00]: it was very controversial in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, he talked with Alfred Russell
Walz, and he lived from 1823 to 1913.
[SPEAKER_00]: Independently, he had developed a similar
theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the correspondence between the two
spurred the idea of Darwin to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: bring this theory to publication,
and that occurred in 1859.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Origin of Species was disturbing to
many, because it suggested humans and apes
[SPEAKER_00]: have a common ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that common ancestor does not mean
humans directly derived from apes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means humans and apes have this common
ancestor going back in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Darwin presented this argument directly in
a later book called The Descendant of Man,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this idea spurred a lot of political
cartoons, with Darwin typically being
[SPEAKER_00]: portrayed as he looked at his later years
with the white beard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a huge monkey here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did natural selection produce this
diversity?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did so many of these different birds
derive if there's only one common
[SPEAKER_00]: ancestor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Darwin believed that the Galapagos
winches all evolved from this single
[SPEAKER_00]: common ancestor, and he proposed that
common ancestor lived in the South
[SPEAKER_00]: American mainland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the Galapagos Islands.
[SPEAKER_00]: These new arrivals occupied different
niches and were subject to different
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these islands are very diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in a close proximity to one
another, but each has got its own unique
[SPEAKER_00]: habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, the different food items,
the different environmental pressures
[SPEAKER_00]: could lead to development of these many
different types of finches, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at their birdbeaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this resulted in the cluster of
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This phenomenon is termed adaptive
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have like one initial finch,
and we have this radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a radiation that occurs of
different variants of birdbeaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 14 finch species that Darwin studied
now occupy four types of niches.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was insect feeders, seed feeders,
cactus parts and seeds, and the others fed
[SPEAKER_00]: on buds and fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here, it kind of has a nice
visual representation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ground finches are for crushing bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the seed eaters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can also be classified as the cactus
eaters, tough materials to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probing birds, these could be ones for
insect feeders as a portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, those that have grasping bills could
live in trees for grafting food items.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this helps explain the large diversity
that has occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an interesting graph here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the number of individuals here
on the y-axis, and here we have the depth
[SPEAKER_00]: of their beak.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here we're measuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 1976, the average beak depth,
you can see here, let's say it was around
[SPEAKER_00]: nine and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, comparing that, we have a lot of
individuals there, comparing that to 1978,
[SPEAKER_00]: notice the average beak depth increased to
just a little over 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a shift in the average beak depth
due to a drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this environment is influencing some of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drought will cause the insects
potentially to go deeper into soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see here in our dry and wet soil
here how it changes our beak depth in
[SPEAKER_00]: millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on the environmental
conditions year to year, based on the food
[SPEAKER_00]: items, that can influence the individual's
beak depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see here is in 1976,
a very large population.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1978, a much smaller population,
but of that population, the vast majority
[SPEAKER_00]: had a larger beak depth, and that allows
them to more efficiently feed on food
[SPEAKER_00]: items.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the grants research supported Darwin's
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was supported by not just Darwin,
but other scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Populations in gene pools, the general
concepts, terms you should be familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Population is simply a localized group of
interbreeding individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gene pool is a collection of alleles
in the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the difference between alleles
and genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example of our genes,
and here's our alternate alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genes are just the specific DNA sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alleles are referring to the actual
phenotype that we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the allele frequency is how common
that allele is in the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many capital As versus how many
lowercase As in the entire population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's allele frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, there's five agents for
evolutionary change.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's mutations that occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, UV light is an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene flow, where we have genes being
inherited or added, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: to a different population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-random mating.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this means is we see an individual
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see two males.
[SPEAKER_00]: One female, non-random.
[SPEAKER_00]: This female is selecting for this male
that has a showier feathers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not random.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's specifically selecting for that
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see the offspring are going to have
traits similar to that one, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going to be passed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This other individual, sadly, is selected
against.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing a shift, in this case,
towards the blue circles here,
[SPEAKER_00]: away from the red circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's genetic drift, and this whole
idea of selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, based on the environment,
will make one individual blend in better,
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing it to avoid predators for those
genes to be passed on to the following
[SPEAKER_00]: generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks. Thanks.
