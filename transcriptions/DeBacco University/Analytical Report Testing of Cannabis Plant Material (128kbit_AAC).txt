[SPEAKER_00]: This DeBaco University video is going to
go over some analytical report testing
[SPEAKER_00]: regarding cannabis plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are some of the things you might be
familiar with if you've seen an analytical
[SPEAKER_00]: report, and if not, I'm going to break
each of those down with a quick summary,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then there'll be other videos that go
into each of these in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into analytical
report testing for cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the importance of cannabis
testing in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been legalized in many different
numbers of countries around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there is some variability within
possession, distribution, and cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big market and it's consumed in
multiple ways, and because it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: ignited through smoking, it falls into
different categories as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: volatilization of certain compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why knowing that testing of
the cannabis is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important for the safety of the
consumers, and it's something that all
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers of any of these products should
be requesting for any purchased cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material that they're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is testing needed?
[SPEAKER_00]: As mentioned before, the legalization of
cannabis for medical and adult use has led
[SPEAKER_00]: to the development of widespread
production of cannabis and its related
[SPEAKER_00]: products, much as we saw listed in the
previous slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, with this increase in prevalence,
there also needs to be testing of those
[SPEAKER_00]: products to ensure customer safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because it's a plant, there's a
lot of things going on that we can't
[SPEAKER_00]: visually determine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to have proper testing done on
that cannabis plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, general cautions with cannabis,
just in general, it is important to get
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis tested, which I know a lot of
growers think that, oh yeah, it's a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is important to get screened for more
than just the cannabinoids and terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: that a lot of growers are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are typical growers are most
interested in, but there's also clean
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is very important and something
consumers should be looking for and
[SPEAKER_00]: requesting if they're not provided with
this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: What information are we looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at mycotoxins, pathogens,
pesticide testing, because the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material might look perfectly fine
visually, but may contain some of these,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can have very negative impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycotoxins can also be potential
carcinogens as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's important to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticides, again, when ignited,
they could cause some potential negative
[SPEAKER_00]: effects and additive exponential negative
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, all of these are of concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not one that's more of concern
than another.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these should be tested for and
provided with a result for any cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material you're looking at
purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what does an analytical report look
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just one example here,
and there's many different companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this just gives you a good example of
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All products that someone is considering
and consuming should have a supporting
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical report to help ensure product
safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes over microbials, heavy metals,
mycotoxins, pesticides, as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and cannabinoids that most
consumers are interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at lab ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at timing, dating,
I should say, as far as knowing when that
[SPEAKER_00]: lot was harvested, knowing that when that
report was generated, by whom it was
[SPEAKER_00]: generated, to who it was reported to,
so on and so forth, and signed off and
[SPEAKER_00]: reviewed on all important information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So categories provided in local reports,
again, the microbial analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals, mycotoxins, pesticide
testing, terpene analysis, and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids will be briefly covered in
this video, and there'll be other videos
[SPEAKER_00]: that go into each of these in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of times we see these listed on
a label, which is great to see,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it gives you that general summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you do also want to have the
backup of the, not only having it on the
[SPEAKER_00]: label, but making sure everything matches
up with, to go back to the previous slide,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the actual official analytical report
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great to see microbial,
mycotoxins, heavy metal, chemical residues
[SPEAKER_00]: pass, but you might want to go back and
have access to at least of that original
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical report from which these numbers
were derived from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a research article here looking at
cannabis containment limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the pharmaceutical use,
cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at that pharmaceutical
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at that lab-grade,
pharmaceutical-grade, very, very high-end
[SPEAKER_00]: grade end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why, in part, the reason of the
importance of these particular testings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the microbial analysis, to begin with,
well, cannabis is associated with various
[SPEAKER_00]: types of microbes, including molds,
that have shown harm to immunocompromised
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, as well as bacteria and viruses
that could have the potential for causing
[SPEAKER_00]: harm to humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important to get that
microbial test, to check that,
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure, quote, nothing microbially
is growing within the cannabis you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into heavy metal testing,
and this cannabis plants have been shown
[SPEAKER_00]: to hyper accumulate and incorporate these
heavy metals into tissues throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and have been previously explored
for their ability to bioremediate
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminated soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typical heavy metals tested for arsenic,
cadmium, lead, and mercury.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mycotoxins, as mentioned earlier,
alpha toxins and mycotoxins that become
[SPEAKER_00]: especially problematic while drying and
curing cannabis products in humid
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they may not be there during the
growing process, but that during that
[SPEAKER_00]: final finishing process, they could
develop and have very negative effects for
[SPEAKER_00]: any potential consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the pesticide testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while many claim cannabis is naturally
a pest-resistant crop, there is still an
[SPEAKER_00]: abundant use of various pesticides to
provide protection, including
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticides, fungicides, as well as plant
growth regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lack of regulation have led to widespread
use of hazardous pesticides, including a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple listed here, microbutenil being a
very common one.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as several others intended for
ornamental plants, which are not approved
[SPEAKER_00]: for human consumption, particularly the
way cannabis plants tend to be consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some pesticides, soluble solvents or
extracts and cannabinoids, including CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: oils, in the sense that if you're even
going to extraction, they can be present
[SPEAKER_00]: in that extraction because they're that
lipid-solid soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that does cause concerns about
contamination with pesticides and the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential health risks that would be
accompanied concentrating these pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: in any final extract that is produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the terpene analysis, again,
as most consumers are probably most
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in, is beneficial for patients
as well as breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps consumers identify the right
strain of their desired effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders can also selectively modulate the
terpene ratios of their strain in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize desired benefits that certain
consumers might be looking at purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also looking at the THC,
and the CBD, the cannabinoids in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as getting to some more of the
specifics of CBDA, CBN, CBG, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that can also be tested and screened for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has been shown to potential
therapeutic effects in treatments of pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: mood disorders, and inflammatory diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the concentration to potency of
cannabinoids and cannabis can fluctuate
[SPEAKER_00]: through various stages of plant growth and
in different plant strains, it is
[SPEAKER_00]: imperative for patients that cannabis
cultivars ensure cannabinoid identity as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as consistent purity, as well as
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way you're able to tell that is,
again, through this testing process and
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure you're getting that provided
analytical report.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit more detail than you may want
to get into, but looking at some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: common cannabis testing methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: This provides you with some of the tests
that are completed to generate the numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: you see on an analytical report.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grower's viewpoint when we look at the
tests is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to know what methods you're
using, and from a consumer standpoint,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's also good to know the methods used to
allow you to make comparisons of these
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers if you're testing or looking at
different labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be different variability based
on the analytical equipment used.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be different numbers,
might be different ratios, things to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider and look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to know what lab the test
came from, what analytical methods they're
[SPEAKER_00]: using to allow you to make those fair
comparisons between different labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can ensure you are an informed
consumer of any product you're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from a grower standpoint, any numbers
you're getting back, it's important to
[SPEAKER_00]: know what tests were done to make sure
it's an accurate representation of your
[SPEAKER_00]: final end product.
So, thank you for your time, and we'll see
you next time.
