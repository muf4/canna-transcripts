[SPEAKER_00]: On this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to go over Cannabis Social
[SPEAKER_00]: Equity Council, at least that was
established in Connecticut, July 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're not from Connecticut,
this can help provide some great
[SPEAKER_00]: information as this is something other
states might be considering.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's get into Cannabis
Social Equity Council that was established
[SPEAKER_00]: in Connecticut in July 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for more information on
this, this is the actual link provided
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all this information presented is
based on cannabis information provided by
[SPEAKER_00]: the state of Connecticut from July 1st to
July 28th, 2021, just a couple of days
[SPEAKER_00]: before the recording of this video in an
effort to give everyone the most
[SPEAKER_00]: up-to-date and current information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while this does only apply to
Connecticut and is subject to change,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be sure to check your current
and local regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is only intended to be used as a
point in time general example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So questions that are often asked
regarding cannabis in this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: topic is how is which neighborhoods were
most impacted by the war on drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: determined, because that is part of the
establishment of this council.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the law looks at past drug convictions
and current unemployment rates to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine which areas were
disproportionately impacted by the war on
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs, called disproportionately impacted
areas or DIAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The law requires Social Equity Council to
release the final list of qualifying
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive cases tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of the way you're going to
go about approaching this to try to find
[SPEAKER_00]: areas that were regions of the state that
were disproportionately impacted and try
[SPEAKER_00]: to help them with positive actions within
this act.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how will Social Equity Council hold
itself accountable to promoting equity?
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have blaming someone else's
line and then taking accountability.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they going to assume
accountability?
[SPEAKER_00]: The council will oversee a third party
study to provide detailed findings on or
[SPEAKER_00]: including the historical and present day
consensus of cannabis prohibition,
[SPEAKER_00]: criminalization, as well as
stigmatization, as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: consequences of racial discrimination in
cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will then make recommendations
regarding the creation of programs to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure that individuals from communities
that have been disproportionately harmed
[SPEAKER_00]: by cannabis prohibition and enforcement
are provided equal access to licenses for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis establishments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want to this disproportion that's to
kind of continue and be perpetuated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a way you can mitigate some of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifying additional qualifications for
social equity applicants as well and
[SPEAKER_00]: providing expedited or priority license
processing for social equity applicants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are ways you're going to kind of
help promote that equality.
[SPEAKER_00]: How will the law promote this social
equality then other than just what was
[SPEAKER_00]: stated here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the law takes a comprehensive
approach to promoting social quality
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on those neighborhoods most
impacted by the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides for expungement of past
cannabis related crimes and reserves half
[SPEAKER_00]: of all cannabis business licenses for
people from impacted neighborhoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to help kind of promote
this equality amongst different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition more than half of the revenue
from cannabis sales will be dedicated to
[SPEAKER_00]: new equity fund which will be invested in
those neighborhoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to kind of help kind of feed
into those neighborhoods kind of help kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of get that kind of balancing act that is
right now a little skewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the social quality council?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it's a new council that will oversee
the verification of equity applicants
[SPEAKER_00]: creating new programs that support
cannabis businesses and businesses in
[SPEAKER_00]: other industries and manage the more
general community investments derived from
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis tax revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again this is all part of what took the
time to get Connecticut's recreational act
[SPEAKER_00]: together because there was a lot of this
which had never really been done before
[SPEAKER_00]: implemented and incorporated into the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lastly when will retail sales begin?
[SPEAKER_00]: When will kind of things go through?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now while it is currently 2021 sales
should begin in late 2022 which might be
[SPEAKER_00]: further off than most people would like.
[SPEAKER_00]: First the state needs to form new social
equity council.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to set guidelines for adhering
to social equity provisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state will also need to hire new staff
issue new regulations and oversee the
[SPEAKER_00]: application licensing processing for new
cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this simply just takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Further those businesses need time
themselves to secure funding, physical
[SPEAKER_00]: locations, local zoning approval as other
elements needed to start a new business in
[SPEAKER_00]: a highly regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The supply chain must also be entirely
licensed before sales can begin and this
[SPEAKER_00]: includes the stores, very important
testing labs and growers and there must be
[SPEAKER_00]: enough growing capacity supply the retail
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The governor has directed each state
agency to work to implement the law
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly while also implementing it
responsibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again there's a lot that's going on
here a lot that's in the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again sales a little later than most
people thought but I think with all these
[SPEAKER_00]: things in place it will be good in the
long run and hopefully sales can meet that
[SPEAKER_00]: target there of late 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: you
