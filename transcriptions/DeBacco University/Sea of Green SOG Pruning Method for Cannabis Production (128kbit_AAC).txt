[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard about the Sea of Green
method of pruning for cannabis production
[SPEAKER_00]: but want to learn more?
[SPEAKER_00]: This Tobacco University video will provide
you with some details about just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn more here about the Sea of Green
method of pruning to see if it's a right
[SPEAKER_00]: fit for your growing situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the Sea of Green
or SOG pruning method for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, this method is really
intended to maximize speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sea of Green method was developed to
maximize the speed of cannabis growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if overall height is limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is commonly done in grow tents
where you do have that limiting of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant height.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also more commonly done with starting
material is clones versus seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it can be performed with either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants can be planted at densities that
are as high as nine plants per square
[SPEAKER_00]: foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really maximizing plant number
while decreasing overall plant size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within a short time after being
established, the lights will be switched
[SPEAKER_00]: to a 12 hour dark period inducing
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant height itself, the plants
typically should reach about 12 inches or
[SPEAKER_00]: tall or so before you decide to flip them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's basically change the photo
period of your lights from a vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period, 18 plus hours of light to 12
hours of light here, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should finish around 18 to 20 inches
tall as far as your plants are concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant should be grown in three gallon
pots to maximize the density with the
[SPEAKER_00]: limit of water stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, some growers will choose to use
utilize this method and grow their plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in only one gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody can pack more plants in,
but the water frequency will have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of this method simply is to
maximize production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also utilize all the space available,
particularly when you're lighting it and
[SPEAKER_00]: have to have those upfront costs to
maximize flower production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we can see all the containers
literally touching one another,
[SPEAKER_00]: can't really get any denser than that and
quick turnaround time for the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the plant hormone influence with this
method, this relatively quick flip of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering photo period, 12, 12,
12 hours of light, 12 hours of darkness,
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering duration limits the plants
overall height, how tall they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get, which is great and grow tense.
[SPEAKER_00]: This induces flower quicker and allows for
a quicker time to harvest, a faster
[SPEAKER_00]: turnaround time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant density should be high because
while there is no alterations to the
[SPEAKER_00]: normal hormone concentrations of the
plants, because this shift occurs sooner
[SPEAKER_00]: than it is normal, overall yield per plant
will be reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers need to make up the difference
by increasing the overall plant numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply you're going to get less per plant
with this pruning method, but by growing
[SPEAKER_00]: more plants, you can make up that
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes that quicker turnaround time
is more advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it is, this might be a pruning
method you consider.
