[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here I'm going to provide a brief
overview of the endosymbiotic theory and
[SPEAKER_00]: how this kind of came about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you look here, what is the
endosymbiotic theory?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a hypothesized origin for
eukaryotic cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get cells that have kind of
membrane-bound organelles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well looking here, we have a prokaryotic
cell and there's a potential that cell
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane infoldings could have occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: These infoldings can create little pockets
and these ultimately could have led to the
[SPEAKER_00]: development and specialization of
different organelles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now two organelles in particular,
if we're talking plant cells for sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: are very complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the mitochondria and the
chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're talking animal cells,
we're just looking at the mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now mitochondria and chloroplasts are very
complex, very unique structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So odds are that they probably just didn't
come from end membrane foldings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The theory behind how they became
incorporated into the cell, looking first
[SPEAKER_00]: at the mitochondria with this aerobic
oxygen using protobacterium enters the
[SPEAKER_00]: eukaryotic cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be either as a prey item or a
parasite and it manages to avoid digestion
[SPEAKER_00]: or being broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an important component there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly how it avoids that, not really
sure if there's other theories regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but it's taken into the cell and
it's not broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it becomes kind of an endosymbiont
and that's where we get the term
[SPEAKER_00]: endosymbiotic theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endo meaning inside the cell, symbiotic
means both gaining a benefit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this protobacterium that is generating
its own energy using oxygen is
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporated into the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cell has this advantage of this
energy producing organelle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The protobacterium gains the advantage of
being protected within this cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, they're both receiving a benefit
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now chloroplasts for docking plant cells,
also very complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did they kind of get incorporated into
cells there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as we'll see in a moment,
chloroplasts have a lot of resemblance to
[SPEAKER_00]: cyanobacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a potential way that they could
have been taking in, again, not digested,
[SPEAKER_00]: not broken down and incorporated as part
of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now both the mitochondria and chloroplasts
both contain their own, while small
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage, still their own DNA that isn't
found in the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this further supports the idea or the
theory that they may have once been free
[SPEAKER_00]: living because they do have their own
unique DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're looking at that kind of
comparison between our chloroplasts and
[SPEAKER_00]: our cyanobacterium, it just kind of shows
you some of the similarities that do exist
[SPEAKER_00]: in their structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the outer membranes present in
both, inner membrane present in both,
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleus present in both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's kind of that DNA component
there, thylakoids, ribosomes in both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are some unique components to
each because they are different at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point, but the high degree of similarities
indicates that they may have at one time
[SPEAKER_00]: been free living and then some of them may
have been incorporated into cells for the
[SPEAKER_00]: mutual benefit of, again, getting
protection, the cell getting a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: generate energy, in this case,
capturing the sunlight, the light energy
[SPEAKER_00]: and converting it into chemical energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
