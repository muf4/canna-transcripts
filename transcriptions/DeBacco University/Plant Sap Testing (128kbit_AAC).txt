[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm going to give a very brief
overview of plant sap testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: because some growers are using this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can buy kits that they can use at
home, and they feel it provides a very
[SPEAKER_00]: quick way to analyze some of the nutrients
that may be going on in their plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing them to make quick changes if
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with our sap testing, there are some
limitations, because the sap can be in
[SPEAKER_00]: continual flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like taking a blood test,
depending on what time of day or what you
[SPEAKER_00]: may have eaten, that can change your blood
sugar levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have ways of regulating that,
but plants, kind of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can kind of change what's going on in
that sap throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, lights on, lights off, when you're
taking that sample, that can also
[SPEAKER_00]: influence it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage is it is giving quick
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's similar to a blood test, but we want
to be mindful that, depending on when we
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilize, when we feed our plants,
when we're taking that test, how greatly
[SPEAKER_00]: that can influence the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also for foliar feeding, that can also
cause a swing, potentially, in these sap
[SPEAKER_00]: test results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I'm not saying it's a bad test,
but the homeowner kits, remember,
[SPEAKER_00]: are not necessarily performed with the
proper protocol in a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be mindful of the data that you
are collecting this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it's necessarily bad,
but just be cautious and mindful that when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're testing something, it can change so
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could influence your results,
and maybe taking samples over a period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time, and kind of taking an average of
those might be a better approach than just
[SPEAKER_00]: using a one-time test and making a large
decision based off that test results.
Thank you.
