[SPEAKER_00]: Often when growing cannabis, it can feel
like pushing a stone up a hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be quite the battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, non-disease challenges
facing cannabis growers can be an area
[SPEAKER_00]: that trips a lot of people up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to cover some of those here
so hopefully you can identify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be a major problem for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at some of the challenges here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers often think a plant does not look
normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is diseased.
[SPEAKER_00]: They immediately go to the diseased
aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: When really it could be something that's
not disease oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to identify that early is
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the disease can often be the case,
non-disease issues that's causing the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem even though it may appear to be a
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like figuring out a chess
game here where there's always a different
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge, something being presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be able to kind of look by
that, look through that and identify it
[SPEAKER_00]: properly whether it is disease or
something that is not disease related.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to realize your power as a
grower in what conditions you have control
[SPEAKER_00]: over and what you do not have control
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: With indoor operations there's very few
conditions a grower does not have control
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you need to recognize what
conditions you deem ideal and how you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to meet those and how you're going
to monitor those targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing outdoors you have a lot
less control so it can be a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more of a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors you can see the picture of the cat
and the lion in the shadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot more control but you've got to know
what you want your growing area to be and
[SPEAKER_00]: how you're going to monitor and meet those
goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing those targets is kind of the
first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what areas can you control?
[SPEAKER_00]: What areas should you be targeting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in no particular order.
[SPEAKER_00]: What temperature are you going to run the
room at?
[SPEAKER_00]: What humidity level do you want to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: The air circulation, the irrigation,
the nutrients use and throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth cycle and carbon dioxide
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these things come together to make
a successful grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any one of these gets way out of
control it can significantly reduce yields
[SPEAKER_00]: and cause the others to be of less
importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're only as strong as your weakest
target condition here in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature again, humidity can vary
depending on the growth stage so be
[SPEAKER_00]: mindful of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just know what your targets are for the
particular stage of plant that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have a check system so alarms
or alerts are great and you also yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: want to check the plants at a consistent
time so you know if something's off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either checking it right after a pump
comes on, right after a pump comes off,
[SPEAKER_00]: after a light comes on or a light should
go off is just a good way to kind of have
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of, is everything okay or should
there be something I should be concerned
[SPEAKER_00]: about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Having alarms or alerts if temperatures
get too high or too low is another way you
[SPEAKER_00]: can kind of add that 24-hour monitoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you should be able to know
when something is abnormal.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, if you know what the normal
should be, it'll be easy for you to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify the abnormal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in this case here we see the cannabis
plants of not quite green color.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be with the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not to say a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if we're supposed to have that green
plant we see these clovers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well this one kind of looks a little off
color so this would kind of be an abnormal
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by knowing the normal, knowing what we
should expect, we can tell whether we have
[SPEAKER_00]: something pushing on various extremes from
that normal either really too dark green
[SPEAKER_00]: or too light green or what color should we
expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just having that idea as a grower
so you can identify something as abnormal
[SPEAKER_00]: and the sooner you can identify it the
quicker you can go about correcting that
[SPEAKER_00]: potential issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
