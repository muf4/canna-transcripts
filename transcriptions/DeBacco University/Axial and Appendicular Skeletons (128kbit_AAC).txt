[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to be a brief overview of
the axial and appendicular skeletons of
[SPEAKER_00]: the human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: The axial skeleton are bones of the skull,
vertebral column, and rib cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here highlighted in blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to spend more time in other
videos learning about these in more
[SPEAKER_00]: detail, but for right now just know this
is part of the axial skeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, the appendicular skeleton are
bones of the upper and lower limbs,
[SPEAKER_00]: shoulder, and hip highlighted in the pink
red color here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also these will be gone over in more
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now it's just important to identify
these two different subcategories of the
[SPEAKER_00]: human skeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking a little more specifically at the
axial skeleton and what that's composed
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said the skulls, many bones have
composed skull, the vertebral column.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to learn about the different
regions there in the thoracic rib cage and
[SPEAKER_00]: how these different ribs differ.
[SPEAKER_00]: The axial skeleton supports and protects
organs and body cavities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It attaches the muscles of the head,
the neck, and the trunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important for respiration and
attachment of muscles as part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: appendicular skeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of the appendicular skeleton,
these are some of the bones here you
[SPEAKER_00]: should become familiar with and be able to
identify these.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clavicle, the scapula, the humerus,
the radius, the ulna, the hip bone,
[SPEAKER_00]: the carpals, the metacarpals, the
phalanges, the femur, the patella,
[SPEAKER_00]: the tibula, the fibula, tarsals,
metatarsals, and phalanges are just the
[SPEAKER_00]: basic overview of the appendicular
skeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all these bones, at minimum,
you should be able to identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is just that quick overview of
axial appendicular skeleton with other
[SPEAKER_00]: videos to provide you with more details on
the different regions within these
[SPEAKER_00]: skeletons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
