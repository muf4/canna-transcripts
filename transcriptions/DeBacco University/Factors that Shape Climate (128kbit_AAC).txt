[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to investigate some
of the factors that shape climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's many things that play into a
particular region's climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at some of those
factors and how they influence it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the key factors that shape an area's
climate, and here I have an outline of the
[SPEAKER_00]: geographic areas of the world and some of
the typical climates we might be familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with or associate with different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the key factors that shape these are
temperature, water or moisture content,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sunlight, soil, and wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now sunlight might be weird when we think
of the Earth resulting in the sunlight,
[SPEAKER_00]: but keep in mind of the different amount
of sunlight that may occur at extremes at
[SPEAKER_00]: the pole regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: How during the summer in the northern
hemisphere, way up near the Arctic Ocean,
[SPEAKER_00]: Arctic Circle area, they may get close to
23-24 hours of continuous sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the winter they may get the flip of
that almost complete day of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can be what I refer to as
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take the first one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature influences natural plant life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have heard of the USDA Plant
Hardiness Zone Map.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is referring to kind of the average
temperature in these various regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a little hard to see here,
but as you can see in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the colors, these areas tend to
be colder and planting to be able to be
[SPEAKER_00]: hardier to more harsh or cold conditions
than the colors here tend to be more mild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now notice it's not a perfect kind of
based on degrees of latitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: See this kind of western coast area,
very similar to the southern, southeastern
[SPEAKER_00]: regions of the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can be located or based on
proximity to water, particular oceans and
[SPEAKER_00]: how it's more mild in certain areas or
mountainous based on elevation here where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a lot colder, a lot further south.
[SPEAKER_00]: So land masses can also shape climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, there's these coastal
areas that tend to have smaller changes in
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and mountains can have a large
effect on climate because it can cause
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the western and kind of eastern
slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the western slope, again if we're
looking here, western slope being here of
[SPEAKER_00]: our Sierra Nevadas, the western slope is
going to be much more lush.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot more water is going to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot more precipitation is going to occur
because that water is basically getting
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of squeezed out then on the eastern
slope or kind of the back side of,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case the mountain range,
it can be a lot more arid, a lot drier
[SPEAKER_00]: because that moisture gets squeezed out on
the western slope and that leaves less to
[SPEAKER_00]: be on the eastern slope as that moisture
kind of comes down the other side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain creating a very dry particular
type of climate on that side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can kind of see that here we call it
the rain shadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the prevailing winds on
the westward side kind of compressing and
[SPEAKER_00]: condensing that water causing a lot of
rain events.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see very lush greenness here and
here by the satellite image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on that other side there the dry
air advances and there's something called
[SPEAKER_00]: that rain shadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very arid or dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that clearly evident here with a
lot less lush green plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see now we look back at that
western slope and eastern slope how that
[SPEAKER_00]: western slope has a lot more, those trees,
a lot more vegetative growth in the
[SPEAKER_00]: eastern slope being a lot drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe this kind of sideways image of
the mountain kind of shows that western
[SPEAKER_00]: slope here squeezing all that,
condensing all that water moisture out and
[SPEAKER_00]: then that eastern slope being a lot drier,
that rain shadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the water here, different
types of rainfall we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically the Gulf of Mexico region here
can get a lot more rainfall and overall
[SPEAKER_00]: the eastern half or kind of that
Mississippi River east tends to get more
[SPEAKER_00]: rain than Mississippi River west in
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again it can kind of impact an area's
climate also.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of shows a nice little
progression here of the different months
[SPEAKER_00]: and the typical inches of rain or
millimeters per day of rain on average and
[SPEAKER_00]: where that tends to occur over the
different months of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see clearly in this kind of
band right here a lot of rainfall overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This portion of Africa, the northern part
of Africa, remains very dry since there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of deserts located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a much drier region
and the closer to the equator area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's darker blues indicating a greater
amount of rainfall on average per day over
[SPEAKER_00]: the courses of the month that we see here
and over the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now suddenly as I said latitude has a
great influence on this looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of sunlight that different regions
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again we would think it'd be a nice kind
of easy influence here where equator gets
[SPEAKER_00]: the most and the poles get the least.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some slight variance amongst that
but latitude does have the greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Odds are the closer you are to the equator
the more direct over the course of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year sunlight you'll receive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also have soil types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these global soil regions and we see
these many different soil orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: These all have independent properties and
qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some better for growing crops and better
for supporting plant life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others not as supportive of plant life and
we can see that they are quite variance
[SPEAKER_00]: across the globe here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see some consistency in the northern
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These deserter regions here and if you
kind of looked back at the water you'd see
[SPEAKER_00]: that also has an influence on the type of
soil that's present in the different
[SPEAKER_00]: regions of the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly we have wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So land-based and offshore at annual
average wind speed at about 80 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see areas that tend to be
windier tends to areas that tend to be
[SPEAKER_00]: calmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also impact an area's climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also be an impact on whether companies can
invest for wind turbines as alternate
[SPEAKER_00]: forms of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But wind can also impact an area's
climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically near the coast it can be
windier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then more mid-regions or proximity to
mountainous regions can also impact the
[SPEAKER_00]: average wind speed in a particular area.
Thank you.
