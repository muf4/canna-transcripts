[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I have a little bit of a unique
video lecture here for you on angular
[SPEAKER_00]: movements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're talking about movements,
it's kind of hard to show that in static
[SPEAKER_00]: images, so I have included quite a few
GIFs here in this video lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to hear your comments below after
watching it, which you may have liked or
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't like about this unique lecture
series.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with just some of the
background, we have our angular movements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, angular movements are produced by
changing the angle between bones of a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we have bending occurring,
that's when the angle between bones
[SPEAKER_00]: decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some of the categories we're going
to be looking at, extenders, flexor,
[SPEAKER_00]: abductors, adductors, so on and so forth,
and here's the description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you find the GIFs a little bit
more interesting and memorable to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to make connections between these
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flexon and extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can occur in both the lower leg
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also occur in the head region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at our individual here,
we have the green extending, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: flexon there going back, flexon,
and the extending on the green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the blue leg, you'll notice
that when it's going forward here,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have the extension, and then the
flexon's the bend.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the flexon, there's the extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the green leg, there's that
flexon there, that moving back flexon,
[SPEAKER_00]: and extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the head region, the same thing can
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extension's moving backwards, and flexon's
going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see initially the initial bow is the
flexon, followed by the extension going
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that's what makes it a little
bit more helpful to remember these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on, we have rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's different types of rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lateral and a medial rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Joel McHale here, you'll notice
initially that rotation's a lateral
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation, followed by a medial rotation
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that rotation of the head, that
lateral, followed by the medial there,
[SPEAKER_00]: returning to that midline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are two different types of
rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then medial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Abduction and adduction here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to remember when we're
going away, you think of opposing,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be abduction here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see our femur and articulation of our
ball and socket joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our abduction is when it goes away from
the midline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then adduction here is when it's
returning towards the midline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So abduction, followed by adduction,
returning to that midline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Abduction, and then adduction,
returning to that midline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elevation and depression, looking here
particularly at the mandible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the mouths are open here on the
Simpsons, that's the depressed mandible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all kind of hanging off open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Maggie helps Homer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The elevation of his mandible,
bringing it back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depression is down, and elevation is
working its way back up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on, protrusion and retrusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the fish here, initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that protrusion as that jaw extends
out, and retrusion as that mandible comes
[SPEAKER_00]: back in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The woman at the lower point is pushing
her chin in, in the retrusion position of
her jaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the upper mandible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pronation and supination, we see that
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we're rotating our radius over the
ulna, be the pronation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here with Justin Timberlake
and Jimmy Fallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that rotation that is occurring
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're both in the parallel
position, that would be the supination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it's rotated over, that would be
called the pronation step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, supination, that parallel,
it's considered the standard orientation
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also another video on the form pronation
and supination there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you found this lecture a little
bit unique, interesting, and memorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
See you next time.
