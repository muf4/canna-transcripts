[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this video here on Tobacco
University looking at sex determination
[SPEAKER_00]: from skeletal remains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you find bones of an unknown origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you classify them or determine whether
they came from a male or female?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go over some of the things
to look for when making this
[SPEAKER_00]: determination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, just a general overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Informative features are based on
biological differences between the sexes
[SPEAKER_00]: and even races.
[SPEAKER_00]: Males are generally taller and more robust
than females.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pelvis is the best bone to inspect
with the differences in adaptations to
[SPEAKER_00]: childbirth with the female tending to have
a wider pelvic region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that's the ideal bone if you're
given a full skeleton to look at,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are differences even in some of
the other bones as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the skull and the mandible,
for example, we're looking at a male and
[SPEAKER_00]: female skull.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at them really quickly,
you might say, well, they're basically the
[SPEAKER_00]: same, but we want to look at is some of
the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the male, the cranial mass is more
blocky and tends to be more massive than
[SPEAKER_00]: females, which are rounder and tapers
towards the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also looking at just the general
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look a little closer at these,
the female having a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: thinner kind of appearance overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tends to be a little more evident
with the zygomatic bone, which is more
[SPEAKER_00]: pronounced in the male skull.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's basically kind of right under
the eye here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mandible of a female is more rounded.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that down here at letter D,
while the male is a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Males have a deeper cranial mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at the side look of
the skull.
[SPEAKER_00]: E, the distance would be greater here for
the male than the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just, again, a couple quick
comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do can get a male and female skull to
be able to tell the potential gender or
[SPEAKER_00]: sex of that individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the pelvis, as I said,
probably one of the better bones to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at because of the clear distinctiveness
between the male and the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keeping in mind, we have the male here
on the left column and the female here on
[SPEAKER_00]: the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a multitude of differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most obvious looking at the pubic arch
here, with the male being approximately 60
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees and the female being typically at
least 90 degrees, if not usually 100 or
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that also evident up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where that female definitely has that
wider region than the male to aid in
[SPEAKER_00]: childbirth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the pelvic inlet being very
different here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the female, it's more round and oval.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the male, it's kind of a little
smaller and almost has more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: heart-shaped to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also some other differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sacrum is shorter and wider and curved
and more posterior in the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the male, the sacrum is longer and
more narrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we have two to compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some nice clear and obvious
visual differences that can be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also use some of the long bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So normally the long bones alone are not
used to estimate gender.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if these bones are the only bones
present, there are characteristics that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be used for sex determination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, not the ideal bones to use,
but if that's all you're given,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can make some inferences based on even
just using long bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using the humerus in particular,
here we're looking at measuring the
[SPEAKER_00]: humerus.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a certain characteristics to
look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The transverse and vertical diameter of
the head region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of where it articulates is
the upper arm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The width between the epicondyles and the
total length of the humerus can be used to
[SPEAKER_00]: help classify or potentially classify it
as being originating from a male or female
[SPEAKER_00]: individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see some of the measurements that
would be taken here in the image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, characteristics of the male and
female humerus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at, when we look at that
transverse diameter, we're measuring it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the vertical diameter, the width between
the epicondyles, the length of the
[SPEAKER_00]: humerus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see in general kind of this table
gives us an idea based on the measurements
[SPEAKER_00]: we get where it might fall and be
classified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that there are some
measurements that just cannot be
[SPEAKER_00]: determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why typically long bones aren't
the sole source used for determining
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics of a male or female
individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we use the femur, so keep in mind
this is the strongest and longest bone of
[SPEAKER_00]: the humerus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're kind of making that kind of
comparison of the general length and
[SPEAKER_00]: diameter, the head circumference,
the weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, when we're comparing the two,
the male tends to just be a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: larger and bulkier in relation to the
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the characteristics here of the
male and female femur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, some of the same apply as we saw
with the humerus, keeping in mind that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is still that undetermined region
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking the vertical diameter of the head
here, the biconsole width as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the trochanter length of the femur are
some of the measurements we would take for
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we look at a database as well to try
to determine whether the individual was
[SPEAKER_00]: male or female, which can aid in the
investigation process.
