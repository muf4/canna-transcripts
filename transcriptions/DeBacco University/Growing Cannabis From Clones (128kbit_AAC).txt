[SPEAKER_00]: So based on the title, hopefully you've
clicked on this Tabaco University video
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to learn more information about
growing cannabis from clones, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what I intend to provide here on this
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into some helpful tips on
growing cannabis from clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, keep in mind that a clone
is an exact copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones are more probably called asexual
vegetative propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a common method of propagation for
cannabis as well as other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this isn't something that's exclusive
only to cannabis, can be done with many
[SPEAKER_00]: other plant types.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a good other plant to kind of
experiment with, tomatoes make another
[SPEAKER_00]: great example of learning or refining your
cloning procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of cloning is to maintain an
exact chemical profile of the original
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, which in some cases could be a
genetic isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning if you have something that's
really unique that you can't recreate with
[SPEAKER_00]: a cross or growing more seeds,
taking a clone is a great way to help
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the basic cloning procedure?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this can get more complicated
or less complicated, but what's the basic
[SPEAKER_00]: procedure?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you a list of the
minimal materials that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many are present in a general growing
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing in general,
by all means, you probably have many of
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much resources you allocate will
depend on the scale of your operation and
[SPEAKER_00]: resources you have available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see in the images here,
a simple kind of container here,
[SPEAKER_00]: a sealable container can work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see a lot of variability here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not the best if you're looking at
having a large scale operation and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: want to make things efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this just gives you an example of how
simple it potentially can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to overcomplicate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the simple and basic material
list?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you want a stock or mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Male plants can be cloned for breeding
purposes, but typically it really is not
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the plant material should not be
in autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind, if you are growing
autoflowers, typically you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be going through and cloning that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I have another video explaining why
that is the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether a knife or even a sharp scissors
will work, and that's how you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go through and take your clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rooting hormone will help increase the
success rate of your clone to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the propagation environment,
you're looking at typically diffused
[SPEAKER_00]: light, typically under 300 PAR or
micromoles of light, a relatively high
[SPEAKER_00]: relative humidity, around 90%,
and a temperature around 70 to 82 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit or 25 to 28 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, rooting in clones, clones will form
advantageous roots and will lack essential
[SPEAKER_00]: taproot that forms when you're starting
with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're accustomed to starting with
seeds and we have this nice strong radical
[SPEAKER_00]: or taproot, clones will not develop this
strong taproot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They develop a whole bunch of advantageous
roots off of the side of the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a much more branched
appearance, much more branched structure
[SPEAKER_00]: very early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind if you're used
to doing seeds and going over the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a little bit different,
but with some of the tips here,
[SPEAKER_00]: going over some of the processes,
hopefully you can be quite successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's good to have this technique in
case you do find that one genetic isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that you want to have more of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cloning is the way to go.
Thank you.
