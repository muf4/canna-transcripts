[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at the
communication between neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because your body has so many neurons,
they're all interconnected, it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: important that they are able to
communicate and relay signals from one to
[SPEAKER_00]: the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, first off, we have to understand the
basic anatomy of a neuron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see a prime example of one pictured
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a highly branched region leading
to kind of a central point into this kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of central fiber here, then another kind
of area that branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the first part here, we call this the
dendrites.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are fibers that receive messages
from other neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They then will take that signal,
it will continue down, and we know where
[SPEAKER_00]: the dendrites are located when we see the
cell body, which has the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important also to remember that this
message will only travel in one direction,
[SPEAKER_00]: starting with the dendrites going to the
cell body, ultimately leading down the
[SPEAKER_00]: axon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the axon is, is the fiber that sends
the message to other neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it also branches here at the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the signals will only go one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go in the dendrites, which is located
in the area where the cell body is,
[SPEAKER_00]: down the axon, and then will be passed on
to other neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The passing on that occurs between neurons
occurs at the synapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's important to remember that
neurons do not actually touch one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a gap between them called
the synapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that evident right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it may look like they're touching
in these diagrams, they're actually not.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a synapse there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these messages that are traveling
down the axons are sent across the synapse
[SPEAKER_00]: through special chemicals called
neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see those evident here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's what's being passed on through
this area here, this physical space
[SPEAKER_00]: between our two neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping in mind at the end here is our
axon, and here is our dendrite of our next
[SPEAKER_00]: neuron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the use of neurotransmitters causes
an electrical current.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually enough electrical current
generated in your brain to power a
[SPEAKER_00]: flashlight, thinking just how many of
these neurons are being actively fired,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these synapses are actually
transmitting these neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be familiar with some of our
ions that are being transported.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our receptors are very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's occurring in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: That synaptic cleft, again, is that
physical space between the axon terminal
[SPEAKER_00]: and the dendritic spine here of the next
neuron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And neurotransmitters are chemicals
responsible for signal transmission
[SPEAKER_00]: between individual neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most neurons make one or more
neurotransmitters, which are released at
[SPEAKER_00]: different stimulation frequencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: While 50 or more neurotransmitters have
been identified, I'm only going to cover a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're classified by their chemical
structure and also by their function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice here we see the same
axon and synaptic cleft and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: dendrite of the next neuron.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to remember, with our
neurotransmitters, it's very important we
[SPEAKER_00]: also have receptors here for those
neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just touching on a couple of the
neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they're chemicals that carry nerve
impulses across the synapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bind receptors in a post-synaptic
cell, causing chemically-gated channels to
[SPEAKER_00]: open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some you might be initially familiar with
are adrenaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of your fight or flight
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're produced in stressful
situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dopamine is kind of the pleasure
neurotransmitter associated with movement
[SPEAKER_00]: and motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And serotonin is the mood
neurotransmitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be associated with well-being and
happiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also aids in the sleep cycle and
digestive system regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you a little bit of an idea of
how they may look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, they may look very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see there's very distinctive
differences within some of the binding
[SPEAKER_00]: that occurs between these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin are
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three other major ones are GABA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the calming or neurotransmitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It calms the firing of nerves in the
central nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helps improve focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low levels can cause anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acetylcholine is a learning
neurotransmitter involved with thought,
[SPEAKER_00]: learning, and memory, something maybe we
want a little bit more of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, just the one that I'm going to
cover here of the kind of over 50 possible
[SPEAKER_00]: options is endorphins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the euphoria transmitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones that are released during
exercise and points of excitement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can help reduce pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why if you've ever kind of been
doing something and you kind of in the
[SPEAKER_00]: heat of battle and you're releasing
endorphins and you kind of cut yourself or
[SPEAKER_00]: injure yourself, you may not realize it or
feel the full effects of the pain until
[SPEAKER_00]: after the endorphin levels have been
reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this gives you a general idea
of how neurons communicate.
