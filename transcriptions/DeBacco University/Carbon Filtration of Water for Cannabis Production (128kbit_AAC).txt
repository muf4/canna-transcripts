[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at implementing a carbon
filter for your water purification needs
[SPEAKER_00]: in a cannabis production, this Tobacco
University video will give you some
[SPEAKER_00]: details and information about what that
filter does well and what that filter does
[SPEAKER_00]: not do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at carbon filtration
of water for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, a two-stage carbon
filtration here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon filtration can reduce or remove
chemicals and heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using a two-stage carbon filtration
system, we'll commonly use a coconut shell
[SPEAKER_00]: granular activated carbon filter,
typically abbreviated GAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that coconut shell is chemically
granular with activated carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see here a very high capacity to
remove contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This two-step method removes the widest
variety of chemicals and other heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals, offering the grower the greatest
amount of filtration of that water before
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's important to understand what
carbon filters do and do not remove.
[SPEAKER_00]: So carbon filters are effective at
removing chlorine, volatile organic
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, typically abbreviated VOCs,
sediments, as well as odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they are not very effective at
removing minerals like magnesium and iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep this in mind that your first step
of any quality filtration process is to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify what items or what materials
you're seeking to remove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that is identified, then you can go
back and find out what best filter would
[SPEAKER_00]: be utilized to remove those particular
contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the reason why we're looking at this
kind of carbon filtration here,
[SPEAKER_00]: what it looks like, that's why they're
typically in this shape, is the water
[SPEAKER_00]: comes in to the outside and it goes,
passes its way through that filter as it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets to the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gets to the middle, then it'll go
up through and then out to the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, effective chlorine taste,
odors, organics, very effective at that,
[SPEAKER_00]: not so effective at magnesium and iron,
a couple other things as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now filter combinations, so carbon filters
are utilized in a lot of different other
[SPEAKER_00]: filtration methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sediment and carbon filter combination
here, because the goals provide the best
[SPEAKER_00]: of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the sediment pre-filter can help
extend the life of a carbon filter,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is why they are commonly found
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though the carbon filter might be
taking a lot of things out, we saw earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: with that very fine particulate,
if there's sediment in the water system,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can clog this filter up quite readily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a sediment filter will ensure
clean water, clean in the sense it does
[SPEAKER_00]: not have sediment in it, will pass to the
carbon, allowing the carbon filter to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to work more effectively at removing
some of those compounds that I mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: here and extending its life due to its
high surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's often seen in combination,
offering the grower the benefit of both worlds.
