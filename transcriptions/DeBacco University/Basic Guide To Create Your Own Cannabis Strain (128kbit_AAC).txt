[SPEAKER_00]: All right, in this Tabaco University
video, we're looking at the basic guide to
[SPEAKER_00]: create your own cannabis strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can be a very time-consuming and
detail-oriented process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just again, a basic guide here to give
you an idea if it's something you're
[SPEAKER_00]: considering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, you have to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when you're seeking to make a new
strain, you have to start somewhere with
[SPEAKER_00]: some material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Determine what you want to breed for is
important, meaning are you looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology, the structure of the plant,
the cannabinoids, the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowers, the plant behavior,
or potentially disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to know what is
currently available in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you know what you want to breed for,
be sure to check to see if it already
[SPEAKER_00]: exists or if it's something that's close
to what you want already exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't waste the time going through
that yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may help you start with material and
will require less dramatic changes to get
[SPEAKER_00]: to your goals, allowing for less time to
get to the end result, which can be very
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, you can help reduce the
overall initial variability to help get
[SPEAKER_00]: your plan more specific and refined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, knowing what's currently available,
not only could it act as a starting
[SPEAKER_00]: material or eliminate potentially what
you're breeding, but can also see,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, it does take a long time,
and also see what the market's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: favoring currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might, that may take some subtle
cues or try to get an idea where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to try to breed for the next big
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your breeding goal, once you have kind of
selected your breeding goals, choosing
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that allow you to best achieve
your goals can then be selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to have that idea of where
you're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to have areas to grow male pollen
producing plants that are isolated from
[SPEAKER_00]: female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have multiple strains,
be sure plants are isolated to only allow
[SPEAKER_00]: known or chosen crosses to take place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't increase massive genetic
variability or have some mixing of certain
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that you don't want to have mixed
for your end goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isolation is an important part of the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're making crosses between
plants, you want to ensure that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: the cross is being made.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order for this to occur, both plants
need to be isolated to ensure the crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: being made are known, known genetic
crosses, not kind of open pollinated
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should include both physical
isolation and also you want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that your ventilation systems are also
isolated to avoid unintentional travel of
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have an exhaust system from a male
grow tent going right into a female grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tent, it is very possible to pick up some
of that pollen because it carries in the
[SPEAKER_00]: air so well and unintentionally have that
pollen enter the female plants and get
[SPEAKER_00]: some crossing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure even your ventilation systems
are isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time and labor required.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that will not occur in
just one generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be willing to commit to a
long-term process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Establishing growing areas and plants of
both male and female genders so seeds can
[SPEAKER_00]: be produced are essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: This requires space and organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organization from your standpoint,
from the grower as well as organization
[SPEAKER_00]: within the plants and areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just that consideration to have
to make sure you have all this in place
[SPEAKER_00]: before you start in this breeding
endeavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it's important to keep your
plants healthy no matter what the
[SPEAKER_00]: situation is, for breeding it can be extra
important as you may only be working with
[SPEAKER_00]: only one plant with very unique genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping the plant material healthy for its
extra importance as there is no backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't just start another round of
seeds or find another set of clones or
[SPEAKER_00]: order some more in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're dealing with a very unique
individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keeping an individual healthy is
important because that's your whole
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program is based on that
particular plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't stress enough but the
importance of record-keeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Record-keeping allows for documentation
and this is critical to any successful
[SPEAKER_00]: growing or breeding operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Documenting, as you can see here,
dates, what you fed it with, the types,
[SPEAKER_00]: the varieties, any sort of things that
you're noting, any sort of applications
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're making, any disease that you
might be seeing, deficiencies,
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding cycles, anything and everything
should be documented here so you can have
[SPEAKER_00]: a great idea or a great track record when
you look back at those varieties through
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeding process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have other videos here kind of
listed to provide specifics and how to
[SPEAKER_00]: select a cannabis plant material for
breeding, selecting a male plant for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis breeding and general cannabis
breeding overview and much, much more on
