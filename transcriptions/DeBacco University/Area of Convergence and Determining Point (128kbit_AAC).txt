[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at the area
of convergence and determining the point
[SPEAKER_00]: of origin, which is very important when
we're kind of analyzing a cast-off blood
[SPEAKER_00]: splatter or a blood splatter in general as
far as where it may converge or where that
[SPEAKER_00]: point of origin may exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the point of convergence
examples, when we're looking at angle
[SPEAKER_00]: determination and determining where those
kind of blood splatters may have occurred,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very important to try to draw lines
and try to determine where that
[SPEAKER_00]: convergence point actually may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here on the kind of cartoon
representations as well as a larger kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of real-world image here, where if you
look at all these individual little drops,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see definitely a point of convergence
located right here in the red circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's a five mil blood squirted from
a syringe at a height of one meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the point here is trying to give you an
idea of what those droplets may look like
[SPEAKER_00]: when you kind of zoom in and look at them
in a close space and how important it is
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to determine the direction and
also potentially the angle of impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that point of origin, as you
mentioned, being able to calculate that
[SPEAKER_00]: angle of impact, where it's the length and
width are two important measurements you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to take, because it's the width
divided by the length, and you take the
[SPEAKER_00]: arc side of that to get the angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why this is important is when
you're trying to determine that origin
[SPEAKER_00]: point, knowing the angle of those
different blood drops can help kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: trace back and determine the height above
the point of convergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have the distance from the
point of convergence, and here we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to use this angle of impact
with a string method, able to kind of help
[SPEAKER_00]: determine that origin point, which can be
very critical when trying to reconstruct a
[SPEAKER_00]: crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tracing origin of the blood spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have the point of convergence
message, which generates a 2D image,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then we also can take it a step
further to point of origin method that
[SPEAKER_00]: adds a third dimension to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The application in the field, of course,
is to use it in a string and a protractor
[SPEAKER_00]: at the scene, and to use it in a computer
and laboratory to determine that point of
[SPEAKER_00]: origin, which will help tell the story of
what occurred at the particular crime scene.
