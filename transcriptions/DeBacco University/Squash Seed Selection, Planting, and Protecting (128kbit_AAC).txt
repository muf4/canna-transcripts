[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to go over a brief
squash seed selection, planting,
[SPEAKER_00]: and protecting to hopefully encourage your
odds of a successful crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one is squash seed selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you need to understand there's two
basic varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's summer squash and there's winter
squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have to grow every different
variety because you'll find many,
[SPEAKER_00]: but these are general classifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zucchini, crookneck squash for your
summers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind you have to be kind of
harvested about every day or every other
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And winter squashes will keep longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examples of those are acorns, delicata,
and butternut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within the acorn in particular,
you'll find many different subsets and
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties, different growth habits,
and these are all things to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to focus on these
different categories, this would give you
[SPEAKER_00]: a wide variety to provide to either your
CSA members or at market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So squash seed germination, it's not
recommended that you transplant squash
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds because they are very sensitive to
their roots being disturbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit is the ideal
temperature for them to germinate,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they can germinate at lower
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will take them a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why typically when we're seeding a
squash field, we wait a little bit later
[SPEAKER_00]: into the season, into that May or that end
of May timeframe, because that soil has a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to warm up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you're hand planting seeds,
if you're using row weed block,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can go down and kind of flame hole or
punch a hole is advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on what varieties you're growing
will determine the spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here, a nice even spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kind of white halos, it's a little bit
late in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: These had a treatment of surround,
a little heavy treatment at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you see little halos around
each of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how do I prevent you from constantly
bending over and planting each seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one person go down a row with a
large heavy metal spike like this and kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of use that to kind of punch a hole that's
about that inch or so deep to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next person will follow around with a
three to four foot pipe and they basically
[SPEAKER_00]: would drop a couple seeds down there,
about three, and that would go right into
[SPEAKER_00]: the hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third person comes through and covers the
hole up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very efficient way that no one
has to keep bending over and up and down,
[SPEAKER_00]: up and down to go through and plant what
could be a very large field of squash or
[SPEAKER_00]: even pumpkin seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now protection of your newly emerging
squash seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early season cucumber beetles can be a
major threat, so after seeding it's
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended you cover the rows like it is
here with insect netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't wait on this because if you've
forgotten about and the seedlings do
[SPEAKER_00]: emerge and cucumber beetles have a hatch,
they can literally wipe out your small
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings over one night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see this here, this has been
recently planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the drip tape lined up,
covered, sealed up, all good to go here
[SPEAKER_00]: and even treat the surround initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, protecting your seedlings not only
from insects but also animals can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: major issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crows being number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can pull seedlings out of the ground
basically to get at the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insect netting can help protect from this
threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have or go through the
trouble of insect netting, you can wrap
[SPEAKER_00]: the fishing line in kind of a zigzag
pattern and help disturb the crow's flight
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or also as a last resort if possible in
your area, if you are able to hunt crows
[SPEAKER_00]: and you shoot one, you can hang it on the
pole in the center of the squash field and
[SPEAKER_00]: simply that one dead crow hanging on a
pole will take care of any future crow
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I know it's not available in all
areas, but if it is an option,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's one to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
