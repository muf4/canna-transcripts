[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to a succession guided tour
looking at the progression of secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: succession from soil to trees here at
Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at and comparing
succession, here we're looking at just in
[SPEAKER_00]: this overall image in pan, can we pick out
abiotic and biotic factors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what's living, what's not
living, what are we seeing overall?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this beautiful look outside of the
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of what biotic and abiotic factors
we see in the image in this slow pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here as we progress from the asphalt
blacktop, walking down this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: walkway here, what are we noticing about
the area?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it treated?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is preventing or encouraging
levels of succession?
[SPEAKER_00]: What species are we seeing in this low
growing area here?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is the species going through a change
as we work our way down?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening in certain areas as we
work our way further from that asphalt
[SPEAKER_00]: walkway?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we noticing about the species
here and how is that changing?
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, how do we think the
progression is going where this stone dust
[SPEAKER_00]: is located?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see some stone dust and I'm
sure this was all a nice solid path of
[SPEAKER_00]: stone dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that changing here over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here again we're seeing that
progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we've walked a little bit further and
we're approaching this tree line in the
[SPEAKER_00]: distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's kind of occurring here now?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's our species changing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are things looking like here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how are they different and where we
last left the stone path?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just kind of a reverse look of
where we walk towards the tree line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of give you that appreciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: For what changes might have occurred over
that given space there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as I pan in this area, we notice
there's a change in topography in this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition we see a distinctive tree
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go a little bit closer to
that tree line but what's kind of allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: that tree line to be so distinctive in
this particular area?
[SPEAKER_00]: As we look at this here, now that we're at
the tree line, we're noticing about the
[SPEAKER_00]: species that are located in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get into that autumn, fall time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some nice turning colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're noticing about the species and we'll
kind of get a little closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start to look kind of in and within the
area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we come right on that line here of
that nice open area and we get to that
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctive line that I talked about
developing which is right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're noticing the change.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's occurring here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be noticing how the species
differing, how the heights of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: differing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the type of species that
are differing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice this one growing right out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all important considerations
when we're looking at succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we look under the trees right here,
we're not seeing a lot of that grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I kind of zoom out here a little bit,
we're seeing here's our nice grass line
[SPEAKER_00]: but immediately it abruptly ends and
underneath those trees, we're not seeing a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole lot of grass in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is that occurring?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is the grass not growing there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the oak tree behind me
here, the question is how tall is that oak
[SPEAKER_00]: tree?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm about 5'10 or so, how tall do you
think that oak tree is?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also not how tall, how old do you
think that oak tree is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping in mind, we have a nice grassy
area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some underbrush.
[SPEAKER_00]: How old and how tall do you think that oak
tree is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now different conditions can lead to
different forms of succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're noticing here, this area
traveled quite a bit and has clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: changed the species or what's living here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how is what's going on here on the
fence line changing the species and how
[SPEAKER_00]: are they going to go about adapting and
what's going to come in and kind of fill
[SPEAKER_00]: in this area if we stopped having people
walk down this path?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to change about the infield?
[SPEAKER_00]: If no one was to visit this area for 5,
10, 50, 100, 300 years, what's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: change?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to be the first species we're
going to see in this area?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you kind of look as a little hint on
the side here, you can already see some
[SPEAKER_00]: species already starting to kind of take
the first establishment of this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what else would occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: How quick would it occur as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also want to be thinking about not
only the infield here, we also want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about the outfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you kind of look over by the
scoreboard there and the outfield,
[SPEAKER_00]: how is that going to change?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you walk along the path here,
we can almost see succession occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: This area is recently constructed and the
area immediately following the pathway
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely has a lot of that stone and
gravel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as we start progressing away,
clearly we see a return here of a very
[SPEAKER_00]: different set of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pan closer to that main walkway where
it was most recently disturbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you look at this tree that's on
the edge of the walkway that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: walking down here, we're noticing the
presence of lichens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have these lichens living on the
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very slow growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to do any harm to that
tree there, but we can see them definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: present in great concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over on this side here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Progress around, we do see them present
here, but not quite as aggressively
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gets a little bit more sun,
a little more of a stressful environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're talking about lichens being
able to tolerate very stressful
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, just looking over a little bit
here on a stone brick wall, we can see a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch of lichens starting to get
established right here as they're
[SPEAKER_00]: progressing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a little shadier on this side,
but still doesn't have to be a living host
[SPEAKER_00]: for them to live on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we can see them doing just fine and
progressing on the side of this building.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at some pine trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now I'm pretty far away from the
pine trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look at the grass, we can see
definitely pretty healthy looking couple
[SPEAKER_00]: clover in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I work my way closer to the pine
trees, we'll notice starting here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the grass starts thinning out a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting to notice the grass isn't looking
so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here, it's getting even thinner,
finer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you get really close to the base of
this tree in particular, you'll see almost
[SPEAKER_00]: no grass growing at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do notice some pine needles and this
was recently mowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that play into the inhibition
of competition?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are these pine trees altering the
environment directly around them to help
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent any competition from species?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if I go and pan just a little bit
further away from those pine trees,
[SPEAKER_00]: we clearly see a change that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not that far of an area,
so there's not that much of a difference
[SPEAKER_00]: in environmental conditions, at least from
a large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are these trees doing to alter
their environment to help eliminate
[SPEAKER_00]: competition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this area right here was recently
mowed today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see on this steep angle here,
a little more slipped a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Causing a scraping of some of the grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since we're looking at succession,
we've kind of cleared off this area right
[SPEAKER_00]: here where the tire slipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that going to affect?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to come in first?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is this area going to be restored to,
quote, it's normal?
[SPEAKER_00]: What species are going to be first to come
in?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of look and see where was that
grass was pushed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we noticing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a small scale example of
how succession can occur when there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: stress in a particular environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're going to look at.
