[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm going to try to answer the
question, what is evolution?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want kind of a fun music video to
kind of watch, well, it may not be 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: scientifically accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here, right now by Fatboy Slim is
something you can take a look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of show in that particular music
video process of evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with what is evolution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a change over time building on
past and current features.
[SPEAKER_00]: So products evolve, knowledge evolves,
and beliefs can evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't think it's just any one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The example here clearly of the phones and
how they have evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the mobile phone industry also the
changing that has occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within our evolution, it's the mark of
an educated mind to be able to entertain a
[SPEAKER_00]: thought without accepting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this can be a highly debated or
contested topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evolutionary patterns in biology have been
noted as far back as Aristotle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one of his quotes there in the BC
era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Darwin initially used the phrase descent
with modification to explain the concept
[SPEAKER_00]: of evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what is evolution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at these patterns of evolution
have been observed in three major areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fossil records, anatomical features,
and molecular distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our fossil records, finding them in
different layers, how things may have
[SPEAKER_00]: changed, can over time the different
layers of rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anatomical features, what similarities we
may see that exist, that may show a
[SPEAKER_00]: progression, and molecular distances,
looking at our DNA and what similarities
[SPEAKER_00]: may exist there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the fossil records,
a little bit more detail, there's the
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution of a horse here, provides the
most direct evidence for macroevolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fossils are preserved, remain tracks and
traces of once living organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're formed when organisms become
buried in sediment and hard surfaces and
[SPEAKER_00]: are mineralized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Array of fossils according to age have
often been provided as successive
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionary change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're seeing the development of what
was once kind of many, many toes here to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of that one central hoof of a modern
horse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Array of fossils according to age provides
evidence of successive evolutionary
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can kind of see that over a long period
of time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also see consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see different rock layers and
we're seeing consistencies over a period
[SPEAKER_00]: of time as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing things progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing things found in the same
layer of different regions, indicating
[SPEAKER_00]: they existed over multiple areas all
during the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of shows also the kind of
formation of where things may have existed
[SPEAKER_00]: and went extinct at certain points as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within our fossil records, and get very
detailed, fossils have been found linking
[SPEAKER_00]: all major groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: The forms of linking mammals to reptiles
is particularly well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the high degree of specificity
that occurs here and how we can trace
[SPEAKER_00]: things back to common ancestors and group
things as similar species or similar
[SPEAKER_00]: related species as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all things to consider here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can get very, very complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at kind of one brief example here,
looking at the kind of the whale and kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of going back and where that may have come
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we're kind of looking at this
whale evolution, looking at it may once
[SPEAKER_00]: have derived from organisms that once had
a leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: May have been land based as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the cow and the hippo here kind
of having distant relationships and some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the progression and how things don't
necessarily always get necessarily more
[SPEAKER_00]: complex with evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just are better fitting to their
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The anatomical records looking
specifically as a little cartoon
[SPEAKER_00]: representation here, but all for rates
shared set of developmental instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These kind of this fish is right here,
this reptile, this bird and this human all
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of look the same if I didn't put the
kind of titles here indicating that there
[SPEAKER_00]: may be some similarities that may have
occurred because they all look the same
[SPEAKER_00]: starting very early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you look at the kind of the actual
images, you can see kind of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern, reptile, the bird and the human
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very hard to distinguish the two from a
very early on indicating that they may
[SPEAKER_00]: have some sort of connection early on to
some sort of similar species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about homology and homologous
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are similar anatomical anatomically,
but have different functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have different structure and
function, but are all derived from the
[SPEAKER_00]: same part of a common ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one to five structure is example
provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adaptations to different environments with
modified structure in several ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here where we're having the
same anatomy, the same bone, but very
[SPEAKER_00]: different functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The human, the cat, the whale,
and the bat, well, may have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: bones, but the human's using it for
grabbing, the cat's using it for walking,
[SPEAKER_00]: the whale for swimming, and the bat for
flying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Analogous structures in comparison have
similar features and functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They resemble each other as a result of a
parallel evolutionary adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a fish, we have a bird,
we have a mammal, and they have these very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar analogous kind of structures all
used for swimming, but if you notice that
[SPEAKER_00]: the bone structures are different,
but they've kind of reached the same ends
[SPEAKER_00]: in structure to be able to best meet the
challenges of their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That quick comparison of analogous and
homologous structures, again, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: puts those two parts together,
same bones, different functions,
[SPEAKER_00]: different bones, same function.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also groups them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here analogous structures all used
for swimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a different structure,
but similar function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have similar structure,
but different function as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just another way to present the same
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at convergent evolution,
there's many paths to one goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have convergent and divergent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So divergent may be easier to initially
understand where we have a vertebrae,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're separating out into two
distinctive paths.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, this branch on the left is
going to produce gills, and this branch on
[SPEAKER_00]: the right is going to produce lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we have convergent evolutions,
while we have this separation,
[SPEAKER_00]: now we have the shark and the dolphin,
they're both living in an aquatic
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: While one may have gills, one may have
lungs, they are starting to develop that
[SPEAKER_00]: streamlined appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting to develop those fins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're having that convergent evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of coming back and having
very similar features, despite being
[SPEAKER_00]: separated out.
[SPEAKER_00]: One having lungs, again, and one having
gills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Analogous structures are a result of
convergent evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different animals often adapt in similar
fashion when challenges by similar
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that with different animals
living in different parts of the world
[SPEAKER_00]: developing very similar structures to meet
the challenges of very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
