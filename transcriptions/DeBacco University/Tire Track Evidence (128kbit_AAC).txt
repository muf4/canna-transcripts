[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to have some tire
track evidence and kind of what's included
[SPEAKER_00]: in collection of this particular form of
evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we want to be looking at
when we're documenting tire tracks,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to be looking also at the width of
that tire track.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want to be considering the
wheelbase dimensions and that gets into
[SPEAKER_00]: the specifics of the vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was a turn involved, could we get
the turning diameter and also the relative
[SPEAKER_00]: position of the turning tracks because
this will all kind of play into
[SPEAKER_00]: determining potentially what size or what
proportion vehicle made those tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this vehicle tire width.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the width is the stance we're looking
at, the track width.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a measurement made from one center of
one wheel to the opposite center of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is considered the track
width.
[SPEAKER_00]: The front wheels turning produce
unreliable measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rear wheels accurately record turns
because they're going to remain always
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's again, looking at that track width
for the rear tires would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement we want to try to determine or
take.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have something called a wheelbase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the wheelbase is the measurement of the
center of hubs from the front wheels to
[SPEAKER_00]: the center of hubs from the rear wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally these measurements are not
present at a crime scene, but they can
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of help indicate if we have a
suspect's vehicle is important to take
[SPEAKER_00]: that into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if it's just a regular car,
they may not vary that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for example, here in the extreme case,
we have a limo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have a much longer wheelbase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have something really short like
this little go-kart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a very short wheelbase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's again, center of front tire to
center of the rear tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have something called turning diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at turning diameter,
it's the diameter of circle the vehicle
[SPEAKER_00]: makes when its steering wheels are fully
turned, pertains to front wheels only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turning diameter is measured by B squared
over A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus A, where B is the distance between
two points on the turning circle and A is
[SPEAKER_00]: a distance between outer margin and
midpoint between X and X dot there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a way to try to determine
that turning diameter, which can be
[SPEAKER_00]: involved if there are skid marks or
indication if a car was able to leave very
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly or skid in an area and these tire
tracks were made.
[SPEAKER_00]: This turning diameter could play into
determining whether or not the suspect's
[SPEAKER_00]: car could have made those prints.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the position of tire in a turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if we can find turns,
those are great indicators because when a
[SPEAKER_00]: vehicle moves in a straight path,
only the rear tire tracks are available to
[SPEAKER_00]: us as researchers and investigators.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when a vehicle turns,
the rear and front tire tracks rack
[SPEAKER_00]: separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get an indication of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to understand and document
these at a crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we see the obvious here of made in
sand or made in snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they're looking at over a mud or a
gravel area potentially or a soft
[SPEAKER_00]: substance in any way, looking at those
tire positions and related to a turn can
[SPEAKER_00]: be a very important piece of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, lastly, how are we going to recover
this particular evidence?
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, typically made in a soft
substance, which makes it really easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: see, but can be a little fragile to be
able to collect that evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we want to take photographs
from all angles with and without
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement tools and ruler.
[SPEAKER_00]: If possible, want to take a cast over
about three foot impression and that
[SPEAKER_00]: requires about 15 to 25 pounds of dental
stone if you're really looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: capturing some of the details of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do want to measure the width,
length and depth and the direction of
[SPEAKER_00]: travel noted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Impressions could be made if possible,
but pictures of the source tire must be
[SPEAKER_00]: included for comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, it's important to document those
impressions, but we also need to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: match it up to the source tire to be able
to determine whether or not it was
[SPEAKER_00]: possible for the suspect's tires to have
made the impressions found at the crime scene.
