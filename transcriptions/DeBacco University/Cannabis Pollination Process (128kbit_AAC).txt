[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I want to go over the pollination
process for cannabis, even though this may
[SPEAKER_00]: not be the main goal for many growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking pollen, produce my male
plants, and pollinating a female flower to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce seeds will be an indication of a
successful pollination process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, looking at flowering plants,
and that's the broad category that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at, and it follows the same
process as many other flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There must be a grain of pollen that comes
from the male flowers in the stamen,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly the anther, and it must
travel to the female pistil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the white structures we see on
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here, it's going to travel down a
pollen tube to reach the ovule,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is where the eggs are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once completed, the pistil will turn a
brown color and a seed will begin to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that kind of formation of a
seed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there's that over here are
eggs, and this is that formation of a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: will start to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the seed matures, the plant will
degrade and ultimately die at the
[SPEAKER_00]: completion of a life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, cannabis is an animal plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This process is sexual reproduction with a
combination of both plants'
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics and the resulting seed,
as we can see right here, will have a
[SPEAKER_00]: 50-50 chance of either being a male or a
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's important for growing from
seed, we need to be able to have a system
[SPEAKER_00]: in place early on to cull out the
male-producing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the same image here where we
see the stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to see the pollen tubes,
the grains going down and ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: forming that seed that will grow into a
seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now female flowers, un-pollinated female
flowers, and these are examples of
[SPEAKER_00]: un-pollinated female flowers, are referred
to as sensomille.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the primary location of
cannabinoids and resins and will peak
[SPEAKER_00]: production six to 10 weeks or so after
changing the photo period depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar used.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the calyx that will develop and
swell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollinated plants will result in poor
quality buds, which is why it's important
[SPEAKER_00]: to remove or isolate male-producing plants
as early as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to increase cannabinoid
production, have the plant divert all its
[SPEAKER_00]: energy into producing the chemicals
instead of going through and producing
[SPEAKER_00]: unwanted seeds in many cases.
Thank you.
