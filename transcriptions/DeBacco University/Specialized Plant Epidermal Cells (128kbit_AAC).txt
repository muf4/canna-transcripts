[SPEAKER_00]: In this short video, I'm going to cover
three specialized plant epidermal cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember, epidermal cells refer to on
the exterior or outside portion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll help it for protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of these cells have very specialized
functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first specialized epidermal cell are
called guard cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are paired cells that protect the
opening called the stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we saw in a previous video,
we saw the stomata opening and closing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's because guard cells help
regulate the passage of oxygen,
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide, and water vapor across the
epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, while these are holes,
technically they're pores because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: These openings called stomata allow the
plant to take up carbon dioxide and
[SPEAKER_00]: release oxygen and water vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The colorized scanning electron micrograph
shows the closed stomata of a dicot,
[SPEAKER_00]: and each stomata is flanked by two guard
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they swell, it helps it close,
and they're aligned to open, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: what's allowing these pores to be opened.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guard cells sit within the layer of
the epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see them right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our closed stomata here, they seal up
the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the open stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the guard cells located right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they swell up, indicating there's a
lot of water, they begin to open,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is what allows things to go
through the air and the water vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the plant wants to condense or
conserve water, they will close up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the guard cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to guard cells, another
specialized epidermal cell is called
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the outgrowths of the epidermis
that occur on the shoot and give it the
[SPEAKER_00]: fuzzy appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to show some good images here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They play a role in insulating and affect
heat and water balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can help reduce water loss because
they're just kind of creating this more of
[SPEAKER_00]: a furry-like fuzzy surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what they look like in a kind
of zoomed-in look, and they are white.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are little protrusions there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two plants that have a lot of
trichomes, and they kind of stand out and
[SPEAKER_00]: very distinctive here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're outgrowths from the epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last type is called root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last we talked about a root,
we talked about the mycorrhizae,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a fungus that can associate with
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also root hairs, these are small
extensions that come from the central
[SPEAKER_00]: root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they occur below ground, and they help
keep the root in direct contact with soil
[SPEAKER_00]: particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root hairs play an important role in root
absorption by increasing the surface area
[SPEAKER_00]: of the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now from the root, we can have mycorrhizae
that binds to that, which is a beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: symbiotic fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can further enhance water and
nutrient absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a short description of the three
specialized epidermal cells in plants.
Thank you.
