[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at hydroponic
substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: While most people think hydroponics is
growing purely in water, there is the
[SPEAKER_00]: option to run some substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: These substrates qualify under hydroponics
because they're not getting any mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: content to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're purely adding an area for root
support and growth in.
[SPEAKER_00]: These substrates, they allow for a wider
margin of error for the plants compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: if we're growing in just pure water
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hold nutrients and water in case of
pump failure, so that can buffer you in
[SPEAKER_00]: case you're monitoring the pump and then
the pump fails.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives a little bit of that window of
opportunity to realize that before you
[SPEAKER_00]: lose the entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also provide physical structure for
the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also in part insulate the plant roots
from large swings in temperature versus
[SPEAKER_00]: just a water-based system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's water holding capacity is the
amount of nutrient solution that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how absorbent is the substrate that
you're using here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa coir and rockwool can hold five to
eight times their weight in water,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means less irrigation events are
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, expanded clay pebbles hold
very little water resulting in the need
[SPEAKER_00]: for almost continuous irrigation with
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's important to know what
substrate or what media you're using and
[SPEAKER_00]: how absorbent it is for materials because
that's just going to depend on the
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation events that you choose to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air-filled porosity, so the amount of air
space in the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is important since roots need to
breathe or respire to be able to exchange
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If making your own mix using perlite can
help increase the amount of air in the
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone and the overall drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see that evident here,
the high porosity makes a lot of area for
[SPEAKER_00]: that air pockets to fit in, a lot of
opportunity for your roots to have access
[SPEAKER_00]: to oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now CEC or cation exchange capacity,
how well the substrate can hold onto and
[SPEAKER_00]: release positive ions at the plant roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low CEC is poor ability to hold nutrients,
for example rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad
substrate, it just means we have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: aware of that when we're making a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa coir is a very high CEC and can hold
onto key nutrients so strongly that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant cannot have access to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why if you're growing in a cocoa
coir solution or media, I should say,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically a calcium and magnesium based
nutrient mix is recommended on regular
[SPEAKER_00]: intervals for those growers in that
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cocoa coir is derived from the husks
of coconuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can hold calcium and make it
unavailable to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why a CalMag solution is typically
recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that you're rinsing
and removing any unwanted salts from the
[SPEAKER_00]: original material if they are not done so
at the time of purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a variable product from batch to
batch, so keep this in mind that just
[SPEAKER_00]: because you have a good batch,
don't expect that necessarily,
[SPEAKER_00]: that same quantity in every batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should always be testing those and making
sure that everything is following within
[SPEAKER_00]: the parameters that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it does hold moisture very well,
so that is one great positive to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also keep in mind of the source
material and sustainability of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with expanded clay pebbles,
they are a replacement for soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're easy to use, and they are
reusable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure you always rinse
them before you use them because there
[SPEAKER_00]: will be a fine kind of clay dust that will
wash away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't do that ahead of time,
it could clog your pumps or cause other
[SPEAKER_00]: residue and other issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to make sure you take the
time to get them properly saturated when
[SPEAKER_00]: first using.
[SPEAKER_00]: These do have a very high CEC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can basically not be over irrigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, many people run irrigation
over them 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be at least four inches deep
to prevent light penetration, which can
[SPEAKER_00]: negatively impact root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're too shallow and roots try to
grow and they see light, you'll stunt the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having that four inches or so barrier
prevents light from penetrating and
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing the roots to expand normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can gain about 15% more weight after
they soak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockle can be like 1,000 and 1,100% or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so greater than their weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're transitioning from a Rockwell
to a clay pebbles or clay pebbles to
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwell, keep in mind there can be a vast
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,100% greater more water retention with
Rockwell versus only 15% with clay
[SPEAKER_00]: pebbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, doesn't mean this is necessarily a
bad media to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be mindful of its natural
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Rockwell is a commercial grower
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to pre-soak the cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do use them, about five to 15
minutes, depending on their size,
[SPEAKER_00]: longer time for larger cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you shake the cubes before
inserting them into a tray or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: holding device that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to squeeze them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You squeeze them, you're kind of crushing
all the air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very quick and easy for transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the commercial grower's
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a great ability to hold water
and also air to allow those roots to
[SPEAKER_00]: breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sand provides good plant support.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be sterilized before you use it,
but it can be very heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it doesn't hold water very well due
to its large particle size.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also make the transplant process
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is when you go to pull a
plant out, if you're using sand,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can disturb many of the fine roots and
cause increased stress for your next step
[SPEAKER_00]: down on the growing scale of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these have pros and cons with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to choose one that fits your size
or your production well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why there's so many options out
there and available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a look at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this was helpful in allowing you
to understand hydroponic substrates and
[SPEAKER_00]: realize hydroponics is more than just
growing in pure water-based solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
