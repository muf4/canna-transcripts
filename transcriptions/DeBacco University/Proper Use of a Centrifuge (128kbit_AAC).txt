[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm gonna go over the proper
use of a centrifuge.
[SPEAKER_00]: While they may look different,
they all operate in the same basic way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the basics, a centrifuge is a piece of
equipment that puts an object in rotation
[SPEAKER_00]: around a fixed axis, it spins,
and the whole point is to separate the
[SPEAKER_00]: substance of different densities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The denser substances, as you see down
here, will appear towards the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: the tube and the less dense substances
will be up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these can be slightly different in
density and by spinning it at a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: rate for a certain time, you'll develop
that kind of pellet down there and allow
[SPEAKER_00]: that separation technique in line to pour
this off in most cases here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Separation by centrifuge, solids can be
separated from solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: A prime example of this is separating the
blood into plasma and cellular components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plasma, you have the buffery of
kind of leukocytes, the white blood cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: erythrocytes, or the red blood cells down
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while initially it may look as one
solid red kind of liquid, you spin it
[SPEAKER_00]: down, you will get this yellow portion
called the plasma and your erythrocytes or
[SPEAKER_00]: red blood cells will be down at the
bottom, they are the most dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be a thin layer, if you look
carefully, this kind of white blood cells
[SPEAKER_00]: and some platelets as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be that yellow portion that's simply
all located in blood, but through the
[SPEAKER_00]: densities and the centrifuge process,
you're able to separate those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Centrifuge safety, because they do spin at
a very fast rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's high rotational speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking in the thousands or 10,000s
or even higher in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They must be balanced or you run the risk
of damaging the equipment yourself or
[SPEAKER_00]: items around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you want to centrifuge one
thing, you need to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_00]: centrifuge is balanced in the sense that
the mass is the same on both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise it will get out of balance and
will walk itself off the table,
[SPEAKER_00]: can run into things, can permanently
damage the rotor equipment, all bad
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end, whenever it's done,
it's tempting, but do not attempt to touch
[SPEAKER_00]: or stop the spinning rotor by hand or with
another tool or object.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times the timer might go off,
you lift it up and then go grab your hands
[SPEAKER_00]: to stop it and grab your equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to try to avoid this at all
costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reason being, it could spin at a very fast
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to let it slow down naturally
because you're putting pressure on one
[SPEAKER_00]: area on especially higher end balance
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be damaging that rotor a little
bit or catching your finger on one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tubes here and just all bad things there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So setting up the centrifuge, you want to
place the correct size and type of tubes
[SPEAKER_00]: in the centrifuge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are specifically made for the high
rate of spinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you always want to use a
counterbalance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The counterbalance is by mass,
not by volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you put 10 mils of something on one
side, if it's water, great, but water on
[SPEAKER_00]: the other side, you know, water-based,
you'll be in good shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: But make sure it's by mass, not by volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we want to keep it balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using a substance that's a lot denser than
water, you don't necessarily want to just
[SPEAKER_00]: put water on the other side because the
volume might be the same, but the mass
[SPEAKER_00]: will not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the tubes opposite of one another,
as we kind of see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the centrifuge, if you have more than
two tubes, only the ones opposite the
[SPEAKER_00]: other will have the equal mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these two can have equal mass and these
two can have equal mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not mean these all have the same
mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two need to be equal and these two
need to be equal, those that are directly
[SPEAKER_00]: across from one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you do run experiments where
you're loading the entire thing up and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's fine, as long as the masses are
right around the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, you want to enter the RPM of
revolutions per minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an option when you close the lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes they are all preset,
sometimes you can adjust the RPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn the timer and press start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remove the tubes carefully after the
centrifuge has completely stopped spinning
[SPEAKER_00]: to prevent remixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will be more stable than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to carefully remove those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to decant remove that top liquid
portion sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep that pellet, you want to
extract that, whatever the protocol calls
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be mindful of this is the proper way
to centrifuge so that you eliminate errors
[SPEAKER_00]: in this separation technique.
Thank you.
Thank you.
