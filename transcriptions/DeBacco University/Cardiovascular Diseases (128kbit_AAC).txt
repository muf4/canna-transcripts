[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to go over some
common cardiovascular diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a little bit about what's
going on behind them so you can have a
[SPEAKER_00]: greater understanding of what's going on
and how the typical process of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cardiovascular system is not working
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with a very common one,
heart attack or myocardial infarction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the leading cause of death in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's caused by an insufficient supply of
blood to one or more parts of the heart
[SPEAKER_00]: muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while the heart does go through and
move blood through throughout the body,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it itself is a muscle,
it needs to be supplied with its own blood
[SPEAKER_00]: supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coronary arteries can become blocked,
as we see here with plaque, and this can
[SPEAKER_00]: lead to damage to the heart muscle,
leading ultimately to a heart attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the heart disease death rates from
2011 to 2013 in adults over 35 over the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see an increase rate of heart attacks
in this particular region of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: How we negate heart attacks or how they
may be hopefully prevented if detected
[SPEAKER_00]: early, such as blockages in the coronary
artery, would be through an angioplasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: An angioplasty involves placing a wire
mesh to hold the artery open.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will insert this wire mesh through a
long tube, typically in the groin region,
[SPEAKER_00]: work its way up to the heart, ultimately
getting to the blockage region,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then literally like a balloon,
they kind of open this up and they plaster
[SPEAKER_00]: the plaque against the sidewalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will then leave a mesh in there,
to help hold that artery open wide so that
[SPEAKER_00]: blood can easily flow through there,
allowing the muscles of the heart to get
[SPEAKER_00]: adequate flow of blood so they can perform
their very necessary and continual
[SPEAKER_00]: function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on the strokes, they typically
result with blood clot in your brain,
[SPEAKER_00]: but can also occur with pressure on the
brain as a result of inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be an actual blockage,
or this is why if there's head trauma,
[SPEAKER_00]: swelling of the brain is a major concern,
because that can also lead to stroke-like
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the stroke death rates
across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, adults over 35 years old,
in 2002 to 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we see a concentration in this
particular region of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you think someone's experiencing a
stroke, to spot a stroke, they use the
[SPEAKER_00]: acronym here, FAST.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one is the face, they begin to kind of
weaken or droop on one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be told to put their arms out
and keep them level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes one become weak and fall
down slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ability to speak might become a
challenge for that individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're often told to kind of keep
talking and to monitor that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this is found out, it'd be time to
call 911.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this stroke, again, those things to
look for, numbness or weakness in the
[SPEAKER_00]: face, arm or leg, especially on one side
of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, it's not both sides,
it can be more evident on one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be confusion or trouble
understanding or speaking, sudden trouble
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing or blurred vision, trouble walking,
dizziness, or loss of balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I included a link here where you get to
see an individual actually have a minor
[SPEAKER_00]: stroke and are actually explaining to you
in the video while it's actually happening
[SPEAKER_00]: to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a pretty interesting video there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, monitoring blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a seismometer, which is used for
two measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've had this done in doctor's
office where they put the cuff on and they
[SPEAKER_00]: build that pressure up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're basically stopping the blood flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they're doing is they're
listening for the pulse and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring the systolic and distal
pressure, the high point and low point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're using this to gauge your blood
pressure and ultimately your heart health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, those blood pressures, you may hear
those numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of, you know, 120 over 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is millimeters of mercury is what
they're measuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blood flows with pressure through your
body, however, too much can cause
[SPEAKER_00]: hypertension and this can have negative
impacts such as damage on your arteries as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as increase in heart attacks and
strokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you know your numbers, you can
compare to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be in this normal green region
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see elevated hypertension stage
one, stage two, and a crisis mode here
[SPEAKER_00]: with seeking emergency care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is numbers provided by the
American Heart Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on to stay healthy,
seven steps to keep a healthier heart and
[SPEAKER_00]: take a moment to pause the video and read
them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke for your life, monitoring your blood
pressure, healthy weight, watching your
[SPEAKER_00]: cholesterol, controlling your blood sugar,
staying active and having a healthy diet
[SPEAKER_00]: are all components of a healthier heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't involve just one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to have a healthy lifestyle
in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wearable devices have become all the rage
and it's helping people keep track of
[SPEAKER_00]: their exercise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't need to go through this high
technologically advanced stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to calculate your normal
heart rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the mathematical equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to feel your pulse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the second hand of a watch or clock to
time 10 seconds while simultaneously
[SPEAKER_00]: counting your heartbeats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then multiply the number of heartbeats by
six to get your heart rate per minute or
[SPEAKER_00]: number of beats equals that times six to
get your beats per minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Factors that may affect your heart rate
can be exercise, medication, illness,
[SPEAKER_00]: anemia, stress, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the age groups here in the
ranges of heartbeats, you can do it to
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to use three fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the image here only uses two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three's a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calculate your heart rate, your beats per
minute and see where you fall on this
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're in the athletic to kind
of good range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Above average, average, below average and
poor is to be more negative here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to consider making
adjustments to your life so you're living
[SPEAKER_00]: a healthier life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go through, calculate your normal heart
rate and see where you fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
