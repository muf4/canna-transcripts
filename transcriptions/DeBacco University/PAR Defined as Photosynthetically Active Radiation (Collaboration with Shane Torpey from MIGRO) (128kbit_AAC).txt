[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this unique Tobacco University
video because this is with a collaboration
[SPEAKER_00]: with Shane from MyGrow, where we'll be
looking at the details of what PAR is,
[SPEAKER_00]: the definition of it, looking at some PAR
maps, and also some light intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: related to plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the opportunity here to have Shane
give us some insight on these various
[SPEAKER_00]: questions that many growers have that I
hope you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi guys, we're doing a collaboration video
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Shane, the founder of MyGrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's MyGrow, the grow lighting channel
available on YouTube and other social
[SPEAKER_01]: media channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm doing it today with Matt from
Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Matthew Tobacco here from Tobacco
University here with Shane from MyGrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This wonderful collaboration will
hopefully provide you the great insight
[SPEAKER_00]: into many of your lighting questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Shane, thank you for doing this
collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with lighting, we hear a lot
about growers and they're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: things and they see these three letters,
P-A-R, PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they might be wondering, you know,
what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it measured?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does this relate to something when
we're looking at artificial lighting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So PAR stands for Photosynthetically
Active Radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bit of a mouthful, but what it
means quite simply is the light that
[SPEAKER_01]: plants use for photosynthesis or growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a broad electromagnetic radiation
spectrum from the sun in terms of nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get all the way from x-rays up to
microwaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the middle there, aligned with the
visual range of that radiation,
[SPEAKER_01]: plants will use from blue up to red.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from 400 to 700 nanometers
wavelength of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to photosynthesize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when we're measuring PAR,
we say that all those wavelengths are
[SPEAKER_01]: equal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a unit of blue will grow as much as,
for example, a unit of red.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not quite as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little bit of variability in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in simple terms, we measure each band
of wavelength equally in terms of how it
[SPEAKER_01]: contributes to plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is evidence, of course, that if you
go down into the UVA spectrum,
[SPEAKER_01]: so a little bit in terms of shorter
wavelength than blue, that that also
[SPEAKER_01]: causes photosynthesis, but it is less
efficient than within the strict PAR
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same goes for PAR-RED,
which is longer wavelength to red.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just getting out of the visible
spectrum, but it does also contribute to
[SPEAKER_01]: plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're looking at artificial
lighting, we see a lot of dimmer switches
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can make adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with PAR, understanding that it is this
wavelength of light that these plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing, wouldn't it be just maximizing
it to 10, crank it as close as we can?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't more just better if we try to
replicate the sun?
[SPEAKER_00]: So speak to the intensity of PAR and how
it relates to plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're measuring PAR, we measure it
in units called micromoles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a count of the number of
photons that are in the light being
[SPEAKER_01]: radiated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you take, for example, the sun at
midday in mid-July, that would peak at
[SPEAKER_01]: about 2000 micromoles, so quite a high
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we are looking at indoor growers,
most indoor growers growing cannabis would
[SPEAKER_01]: grow probably at around 800 micromoles,
quite typical today.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there is research showing that
the rate of growth will increase if you
[SPEAKER_01]: increase that micromole level all the way
up to about 1500 micromoles.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, using a higher PAR intensity than
that, and particularly over a long period
[SPEAKER_01]: of time, the plants do have a limitation
as to how much they can absorb,
[SPEAKER_01]: and in particular, over the length of the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it's good to mention that
limitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to be as efficient with
our lighting as possible, the electricity
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption, and really looking at final
yield and plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, a lot of growers,
when we look at a light, scroll down,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully you're finding these PAR maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of numbers, there's a lot of
variation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just explain a little bit what
growers are looking at when they take a
[SPEAKER_00]: look at a PAR map of a light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so again, when we're measuring PAR,
we're measuring micromoles, micromoles per
[SPEAKER_01]: meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_01]: We measure them using a special sensor
called a quantum sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to determine the effect and
effectiveness of a lighting system,
[SPEAKER_01]: we look at how the PAR intensity,
that is the PAR level, right across a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant canopy or a growing area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do so by measuring the PAR
intensity across that grow area,
[SPEAKER_01]: usually in a grid.
[SPEAKER_01]: A grid, the more squares in that grid or
the more measurements in that grid,
[SPEAKER_01]: the better, because we get a higher
resolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that enables us to visually see the
PAR intensity right across the grow area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be represented sometimes as a heat
map, where you'd have, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of going from cool to hot,
where the PAR intensity raises from
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively low to relatively high,
or it may just be shown in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very useful visual aid to
understanding the effectiveness of a
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting system and how well it is going
to determine how high the PAR intensity is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be underneath that fixture in
your grow tent setup, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: and also the quality of the distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how uniform it is across that plant
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree that uniformity is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of quotes might be for, you know,
the highest intensity, but you want to see
[SPEAKER_00]: how that's going to spread out over your
grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also keep in mind the distance between
that and your plants can also affect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding those PAR maps,
looking how it compares to your growing
[SPEAKER_00]: operation will allow you to make a quality
choice on the lighting you choose to
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's one thing I would add to that,
which is in terms of hanging height of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fixture, to get the most PAR intensity
down onto the grow, generally you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: have the fixture as low as possible,
as close to the plant canopy as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it is a compromise because if you
have it too low, you get very high PAR
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Directly under the fixture, but it won't
spread out to the edges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're looking at a PAR map,
it's usually a compromise of hanging the
[SPEAKER_01]: fixture as low as possible, but not too
low that you get so that you get an even
[SPEAKER_01]: and uniform spread over the target area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for this kind of look
at everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people go through and look at
these figures, look at these maps,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can apply it to their situation and
make an informed choice on their decision.
Thank you.
