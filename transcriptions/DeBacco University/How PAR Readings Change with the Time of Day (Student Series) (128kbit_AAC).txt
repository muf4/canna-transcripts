[SPEAKER_00]: On this Tobacco University student series
video, we're going to see how PAR readings
[SPEAKER_00]: change with the time of day by taking some
samplings different times of the day and
[SPEAKER_00]: just seeing how quickly that sunlight can
really reduce that PAR over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, before I get into the video,
I just want to let you know that PAR
[SPEAKER_00]: meters do have different modes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that the PAR meters
are in the indoor light setting for the
[SPEAKER_00]: electric, or if you're outdoors,
make sure you're set to sun there,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you're getting accurate readings in
your different locations there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the location specifically we'll be
seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This video was taken on a sunny day during
the first week of August in the Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you the approximate GPS
coordinates provided right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in southern New England.
[SPEAKER_00]: The elevation was about 50 feet above sea
level, and the PAR readings were taken
[SPEAKER_00]: from noon to 7.35 p.m., and you can see
when the official sunrise and sunset was
[SPEAKER_00]: for the day, as well as the duration of
sunlight there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just give you the unit for PAR
readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's micromoles per meter per second
there, and it gives you the noon reading,
[SPEAKER_00]: the 3 p.m., and the 5 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see some additional closer time
intervals as the day progresses,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to see how those PAR readings change
and hope you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we're outside using our PAR
reader to compare the PAR of the sun with
[SPEAKER_01]: the PAR of our artificial lighting inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, it's about 6 p.m., the first
week of August.
[SPEAKER_01]: My PAR reader is reading about 720,
just over 700.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, with this information, we could
compare with our inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today is the same day, the first week of
August, just an hour later from when we
[SPEAKER_01]: took our last PAR reading, so now it is 7
o'clock, and we're taking a PAR reading of
[SPEAKER_01]: about 145, which is drastically different
from the 700 that we got just an hour ago
[SPEAKER_01]: at 6 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are outside again, taking another PAR
reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same day, the first week of
August, just 15 minutes since our last
[SPEAKER_01]: reading at 7.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's now 7.15, and we're reading at only
about 27 to 28 for our PAR reading,
[SPEAKER_01]: which, again, is a drastic difference from
the 100 it was just 15 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are back outside again about 10 minutes
later, on the same day, first week of
[SPEAKER_01]: August, to take another PAR reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, it's about 7.25, and we're only
reading about 14 or 15 now, compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: what it was just 10 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we are out for our final PAR
reading of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is still the same day, the first week
of August, except it is 10 minutes after
[SPEAKER_01]: our last reading, meaning that it is 7.35
p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we're reading at about a 6 or a
7 compared to just 10 minutes ago when we
[SPEAKER_01]: were at double digits at 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are now officially in the singular
digits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching, and we'll see you
next time.
