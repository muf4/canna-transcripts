[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
I'm going to take you outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take a look at different
size containers and the different size
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plants that they produce even on
the early stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is a question I often get
asked is what size container should I be
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in?
[SPEAKER_00]: And outdoor applications have different
parameters than indoor growing operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to see a comparison between
a 10 gallon, about a 40 gallon container
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see in the image here,
the larger pot is definitely making a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be a multitude of reasons for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for outdoor production, you might want
to be thinking a little bit bigger than
[SPEAKER_00]: information you might be getting from
indoor growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go outside and let's take a look
to see our different container sizes and
[SPEAKER_00]: how our plants are performing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers often want to know what size
container they should be growing their
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're in an outdoor location and
these plants were started in small little
[SPEAKER_00]: containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what size do you pot them up to
and how much kind of repotting do you go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in an outdoor growing location,
that should be kept to a minimum and
[SPEAKER_00]: basically transplanted right from this
size to whatever your final container is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here we see a little bit of a
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a 10 gallon grow bags right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a larger one located
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably a 35 gallon bag here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see just the difference in
plant growth that that larger area is
[SPEAKER_00]: causing there to be a larger plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this doesn't mean that just we get a
hundred gallon pot, it'd be that much
[SPEAKER_00]: larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So advantage to the larger bags in this
outdoor setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it is quite warm today.
[SPEAKER_00]: These smaller containers, they're going to
heat up a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to cause your root zone
temperature to become elevated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be approaching 90 degrees
Fahrenheit here today, if not higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, that soil temp is going to
get much higher, indicating that root zone
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature is going to get warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And above 72 degrees Fahrenheit really is
detrimental to root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top growth can handle that, but we want to
keep that root zone cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: This larger container allows a greater
buffering capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows this to take longer time to go
through and heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, that cooler root zone
temperature will allow the plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually proliferate much greater than if
you get a really, really hot root zone
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might see this with clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've gone through and done cloning
with particularly aeroponics and you get
[SPEAKER_00]: that temperature too warm, you're going to
have issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to reduce or retard your
total rooting and increase your rooting
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind that sometimes
larger bags are better, but it's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: linear scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is that theoretical maximum there,
that plateau.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, that 45 gallon pot for an
outdoor growing setup, with a compost base
[SPEAKER_00]: with some manure added to it medium,
looks like it's performing a lot better
[SPEAKER_00]: even in the early stages, which I would
expect to progress as the season
[SPEAKER_00]: continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
Thank you.
