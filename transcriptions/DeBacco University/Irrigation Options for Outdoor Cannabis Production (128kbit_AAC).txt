[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this DeBacco University video,
we'll be covering three of the main
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation options for outdoor production,
giving you some of the advantages and
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantages of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over irrigation
options for outdoor cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off with outdoor production,
just in general, with the lack of reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: predictions or rain events, Sears Growers
will install some form of irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: system especially for high value crops
such as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, an irrigation system allows
for nutrient solution to be added during
[SPEAKER_00]: the season to not only hydrate,
but avoid potential nutrient deficiencies
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why it is worth the initial
investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're having a rainy start to the
season, outdoor irrigation is strongly
[SPEAKER_00]: encouraged and advised, particularly for
high value crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what are the three types I want to
talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first one is going to be drip
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages of drip irrigation is that
it has minimal water loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very efficient method of
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also allows growers to have precise
control over the plant irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can clearly see here, especially if
growing in long rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages are the upfront
cost of buying all the materials,
[SPEAKER_00]: neither the drip tape, but the main lines
and fittings that are required,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as filters, potential timers,
also the initial setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a little bit of labor intensive to
set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're looking at doing plastic
mulches, that initial setup can be done
[SPEAKER_00]: via tractors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're laying the plastic mulch,
but there is still the need to buy the
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment, need to set it up properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can be a drawback of this type of
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also overhead irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages here is that it's very easy
to set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of misters here, make sure they
overlap, depending on the pressure and
[SPEAKER_00]: volume you have, depends on how many you
can run.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're looking at, you only need to
stall them down rows within the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also minimum equipment
requirements typically they operate at
[SPEAKER_00]: high pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty forgiving if there's small
particulate in the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is two of the great advantages of
overhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantage to overhead
irrigation is there's high rates of water
[SPEAKER_00]: loss due to evaporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also this method inherently increases
leaf wetness, which late in the season
[SPEAKER_00]: could increase odds of bud rot for
especially talking about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind that early in the
season, it might be great or in really hot
[SPEAKER_00]: days to kind of cool the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But later in the season, it could present
or increase the odds of potential issues
[SPEAKER_00]: such as bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, there's hand watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages is that it allows for a
plant specific care.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantage is it can be
very time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also plants can be missed by growers,
just not intentionally, but just missing a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about time consuming, especially
on large scale productions, it can be very
[SPEAKER_00]: time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two hours a day could be spent just
irrigating the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does allow for that specific plant
care and then smaller plant growing
[SPEAKER_00]: operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages of that specific care and
lack of really any specialized equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: could allow it to be utilized in that type
of operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of these three are discussed further
here on Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
