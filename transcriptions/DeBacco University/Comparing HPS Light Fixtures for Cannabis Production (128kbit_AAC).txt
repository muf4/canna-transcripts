[SPEAKER_00]: If you're shopping for HPS lighting here
at Tobacco University, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide a comparison of some common light
fixtures so it can help educate your
[SPEAKER_00]: process as you go through and make your
final selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into comparing HPS light
fixtures for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, as a disclaimer,
I've not received any financial
[SPEAKER_00]: compensation for writing the following
product review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no material connection to the
brands, products or services that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a standard for comparison,
so we're comparing apples to apples or
[SPEAKER_00]: oranges to oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the following are double-ended 1000
watt fixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: For each light, I'll provide the good,
the bad and recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with our first one here,
the Gavita Pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Gavita Pro generates 2,100 micromoles
per second of light, light maintenance of
[SPEAKER_00]: over 96% per 5,000 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you only need to replace it once a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a variety of reflector options
and they're easy to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bad is a minimum hang distance of one
meter and it's best for areas that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: ceiling height limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Phantom Low Profile is another example
of a high pressure sodium light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they use this kind of European arc
tube material that outputs 2,100
[SPEAKER_00]: micromoles per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PPF in the 400 to 700 nanometers and
2,330 micromoles per second of the 280 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 800 nanometers area when operated at a
thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a very powerful light.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10,000 hour service lifetime reduces
operational expenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a long light in shape for size and
mounting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a side mounted power cord
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of not really the best for
looking at stringing them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might create a little bit of an issue
when you're trying to go through and make
[SPEAKER_00]: everything clean, neat and tidy in your
grow area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a low profile that allows ceiling
height limited growers to utilize the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an advantage to this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I was only to select one and
again, I didn't provide a ton of options,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the Gavita Pro would get my
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have purchased these lights at least in
the 600 watt area.
[SPEAKER_00]: No growers that have used a thousand
watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find them simple, reliable and easy
to change reflectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for that, that gets my initial
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sense that's a good sense for
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS lights are getting a little bit harder
to find with the influx of other lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: sources, but still can produce a high
quality crop on HPS lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let them tell you otherwise it is
still possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the reduction in price of the
fixtures overall, it is worthy of a
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at still producing high
yield, we're trying to reduce costs.
