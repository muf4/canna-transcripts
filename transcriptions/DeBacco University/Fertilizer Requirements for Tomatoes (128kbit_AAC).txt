[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, it's going to be a quick overview of
fertilizer requirements for tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind it could be organic
fertilizer like manure or it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: bagged commercial fertilizer that you're
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Key part is to start with a soil test and
to amend your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least you have your general
conditions near that optimum level along
[SPEAKER_00]: with the pH around 6.0 to 6.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for field production, looking at early
season, usually adding nitrogen is
[SPEAKER_00]: typically required, especially if you see
your plants kind of going a little limey
[SPEAKER_00]: green, and it can be supplied through
calcium nitrate, urea, or blood meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that urea is almost four
times as strong as blood meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going from blood meal to
urea, you're not going to be using the
[SPEAKER_00]: same volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that these percentages of
nitrogen are that first number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mid-season we're typically going to switch
over to usually a calcium based
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one from Botanicare.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a quality calcium source.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have tissue tests to prove that it's
ability to increase calcium levels in
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're under organic certification,
there's biomin calcium, which is armory
[SPEAKER_00]: certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Late in the season, looking at sulfate of
potassium, 0050, which is low salt,
[SPEAKER_00]: is typically preferred over potassium
chloride, which is 0062.
[SPEAKER_00]: So higher percentage of potassium,
but also higher salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium nitrate is typically not advised
because at times of the year, you usually
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to be adding nitrogen,
though if your plants are deficient in
[SPEAKER_00]: that, it is worth considering that as a
nitrogen and also potassium source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under plastic, under high tunnel
conditions, same thing, early season
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, same as previous slide,
mid-season calcium, but usually the later
[SPEAKER_00]: in the season, we want to do a potassium
and calcium kind of rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may depend on the exact conditions,
but in years of hot weather where
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation frequency is very high,
it can lead to flushing of nutrients from
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil in these operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, you may want to have more of
a rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since unlike field situations,
you may push some of your early season
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients out of the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are just some general ideas to
keep in mind for fertilizer requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I kind of kept it very basic,
very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to go overboard,
despite what fertilizer companies may tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
