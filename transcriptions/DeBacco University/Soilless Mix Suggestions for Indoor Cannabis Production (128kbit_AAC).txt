[SPEAKER_00]: If you're thinking about using soilless
mix for your indoor cannabis production,
[SPEAKER_00]: here in DeBaco University, I want to
provide you with some specifics and some
[SPEAKER_00]: tips to help you with that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into some soilless
mix suggestions for indoor cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I want you to understand
that there are, as I'm sure you are well
[SPEAKER_00]: aware, many soilless mix options.
[SPEAKER_00]: This category has many options within this
broad title here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers will find one brand and stick with
this, and different growers have different
[SPEAKER_00]: favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, remember that manufacturers can
change unexpectedly, modify the recipe,
[SPEAKER_00]: or discontinue a soilless mix line at any
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be well aware and well
diversified so you do not have to relearn
[SPEAKER_00]: everything just because the manufacturer
decided to make a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most general purpose soilless mixes will
work out just fine for cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_00]: productions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you need to have necessarily
only one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some common brands,
Promix BX, Botanic Care Mix Online,
[SPEAKER_00]: Fox Farm, for example, the Happy Frog
listed or shown right above me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just some examples of some
common ones that you may be familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: or may have seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's a soilless mix recipe for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the description I provided with some
links to some references.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to check those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got some of the information here,
as well as I cite a source at the very
[SPEAKER_00]: last slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to check out as well for
more specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the following here, is listed for
about one cubic foot volume for easy
[SPEAKER_00]: scaling up to match your volume,
as far as kind of what you should be kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of mixing in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, directed more towards the cannabis
plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please take this as only a succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many different other options out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 50% peat, 50% vermiculite,
five grams of dolomitic limestone to
[SPEAKER_00]: counterbalance some of the acidity that
the peat may be bringing in, and 10 grams
[SPEAKER_00]: of gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are to help supply some calcium to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Properties of this medium mix allows for
greater balance and aeration, and also
[SPEAKER_00]: water retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers will supplement the
vermiculite for prolite, but vermiculite
[SPEAKER_00]: can potentially supply some silicate for
the plant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, which is why I like that one,
as I said, very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% vermiculite, 50 grams dolomitic
limestone, 10 grams gypsum for that one
[SPEAKER_00]: cubic foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will notice there are others that go a
little bit more in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some develop these super soil recipes and
list all these ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the actuality, as far as the plant's
concerned, many of these details may not
[SPEAKER_00]: be needed or may not be really benefiting
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with this very basic formula and
building from there would be my
[SPEAKER_00]: suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that vermiculite that I mentioned,
what's it kind of look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's kind of got this kind of that
goldish kind of brownish kind of look to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's so great about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it has a lot of water holding
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CEC, which stands for cation exchange
capacity, which has silicate in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's likely to benefit cannabis,
unlike other substrate products,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly prolite, which I know is
commonly used.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, vermiculite use, if you haven't
heard of it, is actually becoming used
[SPEAKER_00]: less and less, mainly due to its
increasing in its cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many growers and manufacturers are
utilizing prolite as a substitute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if given the option for a better kind
of material to add, vermiculite would be
[SPEAKER_00]: better than prolite, but it might be a
little harder to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do find it, you might find it
to be a little more costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the peat moss, as an example here,
has properties that are conducive to
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, some are looking for alternatives
and supplements with some turning to
[SPEAKER_00]: shredded wood and other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coconut coir is a good additive as well,
but has slightly different properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, looking at a good kind of base
property use, this peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture I've taken myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ones that I've used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite a good product here, very easy to
apply, very consistent, and usually easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to get overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, there could be some
environmental concerns by some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So optimizing the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that mix there, what's very
important is that you have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: optimized pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some pee can have a natural pH of around
3.8, which is very acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when mixed with the vermiculite,
it usually will end up around 4.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, our target pH is around 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.0, 6.3, 6.5, typically somewhere in that
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: To achieve this dolmitic limestone,
which is naturally high in magnesium,
[SPEAKER_00]: it needs to be added to raise the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dolmitic lime would be advised over
calcitic or hydrated lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding gypsum will add some calcium and
sulfur in a slow release rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a good kind of general additive
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it was mentioned in the
previous recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for that reference,
not only in the description, but here I've
[SPEAKER_00]: provided you another YouTube video link
that you're welcome to, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: take a look at there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is intended to be that quick
little summary, kind of giving you that
[SPEAKER_00]: quick little rundown.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at going through and
kind of using a soilless mix, hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: this gives you a quick recipe to get
started with that process.
