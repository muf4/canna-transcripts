[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, the great debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature versus nurture.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do genes and the environment play and
interact with one another?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a consistent kind of one versus the
other?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a blended appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this actually lurk and how does
this actually kind of play out in real
[SPEAKER_00]: life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, starting here, environment
influences on gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, phenocopies are environmentally
produced phenotypes that mimic mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental factors can influence
genetic expression after birth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pro-nutrition can affect brain growth and
body development and height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Childhood hormone, basically lack of
certain hormones, can lead to abnormal
[SPEAKER_00]: skeletal growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here obesity trends in the United
States occurring from 1985.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that there's some differences
in different regions of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different states tend to have greater
obesity and we notice that the percentages
[SPEAKER_00]: increase overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking from 1985 and here we
are going 2005, a little bit beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2007, 2008, nine, 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from 1985 to 2010, the important thing
to keep in mind there is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: population, or the genetics of the
population at least, is not changing all
[SPEAKER_00]: that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the grand scheme of things,
that's really not that long of a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's changing though is the environment
that can be changing, the diet of the
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals and that's what's occurring
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're defining it as BMIs greater
than 30 or 30 pounds overweight per 5 foot
[SPEAKER_00]: 4 person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just an example there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genes versus the environment in
interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, environmental limits genetic
potential but does not affect the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The example here is our bald cypress
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one that's kept alive in a small
little container and grown in a bonsai
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that tree may only be maybe a foot and
a half tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here would be a bald cypress grown in the
wild where it's able to not hit some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of environmental limits, not grown in very
small containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how large of a tree that it can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, these two trees could be
clones of one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be the same genetics but based
on the environment that they are in,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can vastly impact the total
phenotypic or the expression that we see
[SPEAKER_00]: in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would think this would have different
genes but that may not always be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's also environmental limits genetic
potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic limits but does not affect,
again, the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a pea plant grown by the ocean might
be small due to saltwater stress that's
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where a pea plant grown in a garden can
reach a much larger size due to lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know what you're going to say is
there might be different genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is purple flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is white flowers, while that may be
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, the beach pea grown by the
ocean there seems to be very small and the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden peas that we have grow very tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were to grow these in the ocean,
they may not survive at all and may be
[SPEAKER_00]: salt intolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was evident when researchers were
looking for dwarf varieties of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went to the beach and they found a
massive amount of stunted small varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: which they thought they had the jackpot
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cloned them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They brought them back to greenhouses and
they grew them in other locations away
[SPEAKER_00]: from the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, they grew to normal
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the environment that was limiting
the genetics in that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to realize that the
environment seeming like it can limit
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic potential, but really it's the
environment that's restricting what the
[SPEAKER_00]: true genetics can be expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we took a clone of this plant,
put it in the proper environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could get quite large.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genotype would not be any different,
but the phenotype would be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would see the true potential of those
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And relating this to pumpkins,
of course, I grew a very small pumpkin in
[SPEAKER_00]: a greenhouse over the winter one year in
2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a 220.3, which by giant pumpkin
standards is quite small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small pumpkins can have great,
good, or bad genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't always be for sure because
they're a small pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large pumpkins are very likely to have
large pumpkin genes because we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: that expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what I did here was growing in the
winter in New England here, the lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: light and other restriction factors did
not allow this pumpkin to get very big.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when seeds from this little
pumpkin were taken out, it grew these two
[SPEAKER_00]: pumpkins over 1,700 pounds for two
different growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ended up in the top 15 in the world
that year to give you an idea how big
[SPEAKER_00]: these were back in 2013, all from a little
220 pound pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this had the genetic potential,
even though the environment that was grown
[SPEAKER_00]: in restricted its size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that was helpful to give you
just a little comparison of nature and
[SPEAKER_00]: nurture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know the debate will continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
