[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be looking at
well-known cannabis options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are many, many options just
here to provide you with some
[SPEAKER_00]: representative examples for these certain
categories that will be outlined here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I said, there are many options.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many current options, with many
more entering the market each and every
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your strain should be selected based on
what best matches your specific growing
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: With end-to-end providing a general list,
a few strains are mentioned here to help
[SPEAKER_00]: act as a source for comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, finding unbiased data is advised
whenever possible, as strain descriptions
[SPEAKER_00]: make each seem like the only one you would
ever need to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see some of those kind of
descriptions provided here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why is to kind of try to get some
unbiased data, try to get a larger pool of
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas, selection of data to try to get an
idea of exactly how these may perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at performance,
you also want to be an informed consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you become an informed consumer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is looking also at the end
products or what they may produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is for any strain purchased,
a COA, certificate of authenticity should
[SPEAKER_00]: be provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: This holds true if you're purchasing an
end product or looking for what strains to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow as well, as far as what may have
produced that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here we're looking at a concentrate
extract and CBD oil, but particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at dry flour as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even potentially more importantly,
where is the testing line?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the data showing an independent
lab?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to focus here on high CBD
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be aware, though, that just because it
is a high CBD strain, you also need to
[SPEAKER_00]: take into consideration that the 0.3 THC
limit, which does make many of the high
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD strains above the federal THC limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because it's high CBD does not
automatically necessarily classify as
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp, may still fall into the marijuana
category if you're above 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, popular common strains will be
provided as a starting point on the
[SPEAKER_00]: following slides with website provided
descriptions to provide some background
[SPEAKER_00]: for each strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the description, there is a link to the
lecture sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a link to sources that you're
welcome to check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as always, any subscriptions that you
make to this channel are always
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Indica CBD, so just looking at an
Indica CBD, the OG Kush, you can see all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the consistent test certificate here
where it's going to give you some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid ID.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to give the weight,
the concentrations in milligrams per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, a signature here kind of signed
off when it was tested and kind of some
[SPEAKER_00]: additional information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, something you should be getting
with any material you are purchasing
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Kush, this is just said to have with
resident notes of cinnamon, diesel,
[SPEAKER_00]: sweetgrass, this dense purple flower is
perfect for low THC variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on a cannabis classic, the total THC
content of just 0.28, this batch of OG
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, a great choice for anyone looking
to get minimum THC doses with a full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's quoted in the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it truly does test at that 0.28%
THC, this would classify as hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: which opens up a lot more opportunities
for growing this particular strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an Indica CBD, this is cherry
wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the name suggests, terpenes in this
would be to crackle with a pop of sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: stone fruit layered with piney peppery
undertones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always love the descriptions that some
websites give to cannabis flowers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that the terpene profile is
additionally listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that does favor some more
versus some others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that might be important to you
for consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, cherry wine is also a CBD rich
powerhouse capable of delivering a lovely
[SPEAKER_00]: balance and smoke ability according to the
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, something just to consider there
where we're looking at what is the THC
[SPEAKER_00]: level and is it below that critical 0.3
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it definitely looks like based on this
test that it would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we also need to consider what our
states are using for THC levels as far as,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it just Delta-9 THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: This would fall into the category.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're looking at max THC,
looking at some of the conversion factors
[SPEAKER_00]: and Delta-8 usually is not considered,
but we have that THC-A as well that some
[SPEAKER_00]: states take into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be mindful of what state you're growing
in that can determine where that line does
[SPEAKER_00]: lay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have Hawaiian haze and this is kind of
more of that warm citrusy kind of tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit as they associate with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably how it got its name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see its terpene profile here as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Delta-9 THC level as well as THC-V
and THC-A levels there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, be mindful what state you're in,
but this is another one to consider if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at a higher CBD strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That also has sativa-like morphologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have another sativa-based CBD,
the Electra here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just again, another option to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see with all these options,
these numbers do change.
[SPEAKER_00]: These terpene profiles do change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've tried to keep the test relatively
consistent just so you have that nice
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember, they also say, choice if
you're looking for a relaxing daytime
[SPEAKER_00]: strain because they're assuming it's a
sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind again, sativa is
referring or is greater correlation to the
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology and not necessarily the
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always caution people when they read
something like this, that it's always
[SPEAKER_00]: relaxing daytime strain because it's a
sativa, not always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: These sativas and indicas are really more
correlated with the plant morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have a hybrid here of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the wife CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at this one, it's a high CBD
hemp strain that packs more than 18%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said they quote CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a skunky and sweet aromatic profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: This hybrid hemp strain is mellow with
tangy flavors profile and notes of cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wife CBD hemp flower has dense green
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see again, here's your
certificate of analysis, something you
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely should be looking at and
considering with anything you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: to purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope this was helpful in just looking
at some of the CBD varieties or strains
[SPEAKER_00]: that are available to at least start some
of your research as you go through and
[SPEAKER_00]: determine what you may want to grow
yourself.
