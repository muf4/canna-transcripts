[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, if you're going through some of the
seed catalogs, you might see tomatoes
[SPEAKER_00]: organized by growth habits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do some of these terms mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they all look like they produce
great tomatoes, but the growth habits is
[SPEAKER_00]: referring to how the plant is going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it be really tall?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be short and squatty?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it going to look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some of the terms you're going to see
are what's called determinant,
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-determinant, and indeterminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, determinant is, just as the name
implies, gross to a set height,
[SPEAKER_00]: set determined height.
[SPEAKER_00]: They typically produce a harvest in a
compressed window, typically over about a
[SPEAKER_00]: month or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Semi-determinant varieties grow taller
than their determinants, but not quite as
[SPEAKER_00]: tall as the indeterminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These semi-determinants usually require
staking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeterminants grow forever, theoretically
speaking at least, and typically yield
[SPEAKER_00]: over a longer period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be thinking about these
different growth habits and how they may
[SPEAKER_00]: fit your operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, determinants are more common in
tunnel growing, conditions where there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: limited final plant height.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're determined, they're a set height.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have certain sort of roofing areas
or cover, you may want a determinant
[SPEAKER_00]: variety, might fit that situation better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Semi-determinants try to provide the best
of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of give a range here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They top out at a greater height than
determinants and can fit covered
[SPEAKER_00]: operations, will not limit the yields as
the height matches the typical growing
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're trying to grow that plant to the
point that's going to reach the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it reaches the top, ideally the
growing season will be over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeterminants will grow all season and
can produce a continual harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get wild and out of control if
they're not pruned, and they can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: basically throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the stake height that you use should
be considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see an example here, an extreme example
of an indeterminate variety growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: taking up a whole large area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The indeterminants, you can kind of think
of them as like jack-in-the-bean stock,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they will continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will grow them up a staking
and then allow them to grow back down to
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these are just the different
types of growth habits to consider when
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting your tomato seeds.
Thank you.
