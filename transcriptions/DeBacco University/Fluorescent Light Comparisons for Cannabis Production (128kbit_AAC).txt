[SPEAKER_00]: In this Tobacco University video,
I do a fluorescent light comparison
[SPEAKER_00]: directed towards cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in the market for a
fluorescent light, you might want to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider some of the options presented
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a standard for comparison to set
kind of an equal comparison, all the
[SPEAKER_00]: following lights are T5s, are four feet
long, and are eight bulb design.
[SPEAKER_00]: For each light, I'll provide you the good,
the bad, and my general recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the first one here,
the SunBlaze.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a five-year warranty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only runs on 120 volt power,
which might be limiting for larger areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: and average light at an average price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of that good kind of like middle
ground light, the SunBlaze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into the Quantum Bad Boy
light, and the good is that the ballast
[SPEAKER_00]: drives more wattage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has large reflectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it is the most expensive option,
and the price performance may be
[SPEAKER_00]: justifiable when you're looking at that
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is directed a little bit more to the
commercial market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is kind of comes in the voltage of
potentially 120 or 240, and kind of a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: general light here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the AgroBrite, which is also
has a five-year warranty and includes
[SPEAKER_00]: these 6,400 Kelvin bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as high power as some of the top
end lights, and it seems to be an above
[SPEAKER_00]: average light at an attractive price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, another one worth comparing
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I was to only select one,
I would select the Quantum Bad Boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while fluorescence may have limited
applications for cannabis production,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you're looking for an early
propagation light, this may fit the
[SPEAKER_00]: particular stage of the growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to some growers that do have
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do seem to really like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to last.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to be improvement over other
lights that they were using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why if I was to select one out
of the ones mentioned, this is the one I
[SPEAKER_00]: would select.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just simply use this as a comparison as
you shop for the light that's the best fit
[SPEAKER_00]: for your situation.
