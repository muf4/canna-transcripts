[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, in this Tobacco University video,
we're looking at the 2019 CBD cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: trial data summary from Cornell Hemp
Research Facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of great information in
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to provide a brief
overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome to pause the video to take
a look at some of the information
[SPEAKER_00]: presented, as well as look in the
description for the source cited,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can potentially find this
information to look at it even further and
[SPEAKER_00]: in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, the cultivar details.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a list of all the cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 30 cultivars used in this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be seen in this list.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, the information provided is
the propagation material used,
[SPEAKER_00]: which included dioecious seeds,
as we can see here, feminized seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a couple listed, and whether it
came from a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the clones here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, many people are always looking at,
you know, where the source of this
[SPEAKER_00]: information, and this is the source where
these cultivars, the propagation material
[SPEAKER_00]: was acquired.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, if it was grown from seed,
we're looking at the percent germination
[SPEAKER_00]: from those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see those listed here, some having
very high percentage of germinations,
[SPEAKER_00]: some having very low percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The NAs are not applicable, of course,
applied to the clones because they have no
[SPEAKER_00]: germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we see the percent female,
which is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if they're dioecious, we would expect
them to be 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are hovering around that
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're feminized, we're looking,
of course, ideally at 100%, but that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't always occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a feminized seed of 95%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That still means 5% of those could be
male, and it's important always to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the list of the 30 cultivars
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we have the observed CBD to THC
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while the ratios were consistently
between 20 to one and 30 to one,
[SPEAKER_00]: remember it is not about the ratio,
but the percentage of THC that defines a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant as hemp or marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: As noted in this trial, most high CBD
cultivars will not be compliant with the
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.3 total THC threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just important to remember just
because it's a very high CBD producer,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't matter the ratio, it matters
the amount of THC produced, percentage of
[SPEAKER_00]: THC produced to be classified as hemp or
marijuana from a federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sampling technique, so what was
utilized here, the Cornell researchers
[SPEAKER_00]: sampled all 30 cultivars each week after
terminal flowering to track cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also sample dried and stripped
biomass from all 30 cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the consistent CBD to THC
ratio, cultivars that exceed 7.9% CBD will
[SPEAKER_00]: also exceed the 0.3% total THC because
it's a fixed ratio of CBD to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just keep that caveat in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at total CBD and THC,
this is kind of a very interesting graph
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The total CBD and total THC accumulating
curves for all 30 cultivars are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: indicated by the colors here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most cultivars accumulate high levels of
cannabinoids by week two or three.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top 10 centimeters of shoot tips were
sampled and cannabinoids were quantified
[SPEAKER_00]: using an HPLC, high pressure liquid
chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then overall we can see a general
trend here from weeks from terminal
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering, we see that increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dotted line represents the total
potential THC and that represents the 0.3
[SPEAKER_00]: level of federal limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now most people think that CBD and THC
naturally correlate with each other and we
[SPEAKER_00]: see that true in a lot of the cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to draw your attention to these
two curves right here where we see the
[SPEAKER_00]: total potential CBD peaking early and then
actually dipping as weeks after terminal
[SPEAKER_00]: flower going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as those CBD percentages dip,
we're seeing an exponential increase here
[SPEAKER_00]: in THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where also it may come to be
important based on what cultivars you
[SPEAKER_00]: might be growing or what strains you might
be growing as far as when you harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is all above that 0.3 level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in certain cultivars, this might be
below that 0.3 level and then increase
[SPEAKER_00]: later in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So timing of harvest can also potentially
play a role depending on what cultivar you
[SPEAKER_00]: might be growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these examples, this would be all
above that 0.3 level, but just something
[SPEAKER_00]: to consider that it doesn't always
correlate with CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now flowering time is strongly correlated
with exceeding the 0.3 total THC
[SPEAKER_00]: threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is this showing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is a timeline of growing season
milestones for the 30 hemp cultivars yet
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cultivars, mostly favoring those
early flowering ones, had two distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering groups early represented with
the capital E.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see here's the early flowering
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivars are ordered from the earliest
flowering at the very top here to the
[SPEAKER_00]: latest flowering down here at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Late Sue is one of the latest flowering
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vertical black line here indicates the
transplant date of June 5th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day lengths are listed along the top of
the plot at 30 day intervals here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're noticing is in particular
of importance, sample exceeding was
[SPEAKER_00]: greater than 0.3% total THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see what those that had the
earlier flowering groups, they were much
[SPEAKER_00]: more likely to exceed that 0.3 level at an
early part of the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that were later to flower,
we see a typically a trend here where it
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes later that they would exceed
potentially that 0.3 THC level there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just some good information here
to kind of look at and see the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: that cultivar selection can make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in addition to looking at
cannabinoids and terpenes, we also want to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So powdery mildew susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were significant differences in
powdery mildew susceptibility by these
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The McCarthy site A had more powdery
mildew than the bluegrass lane site B.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, this site just had more
powdery mildew than the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Data were a lot transformed for the
bluegrass lane farm trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Letters indicate statistically significant
differences between cultivars based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: post hoc Tukey's HSD test.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we can look at all the data here,
what is definitely an interesting note is
[SPEAKER_00]: that no powdery mildew was observed on
first light 58.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is kind of very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's indicated by the letter A here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see that all the different
letters, again, no significant difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of cultivars that share
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because first light only has the A
alone and no other letters, it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic kind of stand out there where if
you have an area with high powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of getting it, if you want to
cultivar, it's very low and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: acquiring that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that these cultivars that have
the letter A would be ones to initially
[SPEAKER_00]: look at, but definitely early indications
that first light at both sites basically
[SPEAKER_00]: was observed to have basically no powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, important consideration there,
something to look more into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this would be a great time to
kind of like pause the video here so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can kind of take a look at the biomass,
the measurements provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is per plant averages for biomass
measurements, looking at the wet biomass,
[SPEAKER_00]: stripped biomass, dry, percent dry,
and percent stripped there, and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the differences between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this gets into a little bit more
of the details of kind of the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass that would be produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here late Sue, again,
it was one of the later ones to kind of
flop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does produce a very high in comparison
biomass there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the cannabinoid analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where most growers kind of focus
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now cannabinoid analysis for chemotype
three, which is the high CBD individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that seven cultivars also had other
chemotypes, one and two, that consistently
[SPEAKER_00]: exceed that 0.3% total THC threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biomass ratio is the quotient of the
average stripped biomass measurement to
[SPEAKER_00]: the average last shoot tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to point out that while a lot
of growers will look at the total CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: percentages in this column and take a look
and see what they can glean from this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we also want to be mindful of the ones
highlighted in red are over that 0.3% THC
[SPEAKER_00]: level there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's a fixed ratio,
typically if we exceed that 0.79% CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: that automatically will mean we're going
to be above that total THC percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: above the federal limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in addition to just the main two,
we're looking at CBC, CBG levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of information here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great data table to take a look
at, pause to kind of do a little
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison if you've been tracking one of
the cultivars throughout here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, the cultivar,
just the general summaries provided here
[SPEAKER_00]: for chemotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically we want to avoid type one and
type three.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to look at the flowering day,
the CBD yield per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can kind of see that here,
the CBD yield in kilograms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they do flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind, there's a lot of
different cultivars here, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different considerations to take place,
but hopefully this provides at least some
[SPEAKER_00]: initial information based on actual
research to help guide your
[SPEAKER_00]: decision-making process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
