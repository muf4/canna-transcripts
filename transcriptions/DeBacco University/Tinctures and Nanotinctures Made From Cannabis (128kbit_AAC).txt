[SPEAKER_00]: Interested in learning about tinctures and
nanotinctures derived from cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well this Tobacco University video will
help answer just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into tinctures and nanotinctures
made from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off we're going to be
highlighting some products made by CT
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they go through and publicly make
their analytical reports publicly
[SPEAKER_00]: available in labels of the products they
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: The descriptions and opinions and uses in
this video are intended to provide an
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of some end products of the
cannabis plant and those important
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical reports will be provided at the
end and they're often a missed component
[SPEAKER_00]: that should accompany any product someone
is interested in purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off let's start with the
description of tinctures just in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tinctures are a precisely formulated
alcohol-based marijuana extract made from
[SPEAKER_00]: steeping cannabis material in ethanol and
it's a liquid that is consumed orally for
[SPEAKER_00]: long-lasting effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nanotinctures are an alcohol-free
formulation that can be added to a
[SPEAKER_00]: beverage with no added taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're designed to suspend within the
solution instead of adhering to the
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of that nanoscale,
that nanotechnology, a lot of new research
[SPEAKER_00]: being done that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just really small particles so it's
able to stay in suspension much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some options when we come to
tinctures?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well CT Pharma offers tinctures that have
THC, CBD, and a one-to-one ratio of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potency and dosage vary based on strain so
it's important to make sure you're
[SPEAKER_00]: matching up whatever style of tincture
that will match your intended needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now use of tinctures?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well they can be consumed orally,
sublingually, just in the mouth or infused
[SPEAKER_00]: into a drink for easy discrete
consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're popular among non-smoking patients
as there is no combustion or inhalation
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just another kind of option here that's
derived from the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now examples of those certificates of
analysis as we can see here, we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: lot numbers, we have the testing for
microbiology, microtoxins, heavy metal,
[SPEAKER_00]: and pesticides, as well as the terpenes
and cannabinoids that we most often
[SPEAKER_00]: associate with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly there is the label as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that the labeled example
here provides kind of a summary of all of
[SPEAKER_00]: those numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's your right as a consumer to be
asking for those actual analytical reports
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how do we get these numbers?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we kind of go through this process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well kind of typically they are analyzed
on a high performance liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatography or HPLC analyzing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This quantifies the cannabinoids in gas
chromatographs, HPLC and GCMS,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is gas chromatography mass spec.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the HPLC is a high performance
liquid chromatography as well for
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just shows you some of the
equipment that's used to generate those
[SPEAKER_00]: testing samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always good to get this done at a
third-party lab and you can confirm that
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're looking at the actual analysis
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again just be that part of that
informed consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have an idea of where those numbers are
coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a great way to educate
yourself and others about end products
[SPEAKER_00]: produced from cannabis.
