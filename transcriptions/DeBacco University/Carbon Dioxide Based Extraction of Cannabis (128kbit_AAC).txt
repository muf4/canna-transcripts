[SPEAKER_00]: If you've heard about carbon dioxide-based
extraction of cannabis, you've come to the
[SPEAKER_00]: right place here on DeBakel University
because we're going to go through and
[SPEAKER_00]: explain a little bit more about this
extraction process.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into carbon
dioxide-based extraction of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what's the description of
this method?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the plant materials first ground and
then place into an extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is involving not just regular CO2
in the air, there is that getting it into
[SPEAKER_00]: that supercritical level.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why specialized equipment is
required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this goes on and it shows another
image down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pressure release valve forces the
material into a separate container where
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperature and pressure can be
precisely controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will cause the molecules within the
initial mixture to bond to the CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many systems will reroute the CO2 back
into the tank causing it to be used during
[SPEAKER_00]: the next batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can kind of like almost go back and
kind of like reuse that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extraction though is then moved to a
collection jar such as a beaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have separate collection jars here and
collect separate fractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're seeing that CO2 is going back
to recycle where it could be potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: reused.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important to know that it's not
just as simple as CO2 from the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are having that supercritical level of
CO2 and that's what is part requires the
[SPEAKER_00]: specialized equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the resulting end product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the CO2 extraction results in a
crude oil extract that must be further
[SPEAKER_00]: refined through other methods such as the
distillation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potency of the extract typically
ranges from 50 to 70 percent cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages of this method is higher
yielding than alcohol based extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less volume material is wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specific compounds with adjustments made
to heat pressure and run time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can kind of determine what we kind
of get or extract from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: No residual solvent in the final product
due to the evaporation of the carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great way kind of quote unquote
to dispose of the waste there.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the disadvantages are that much
higher initial startup costs when compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to other extraction methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once purchased, the equipment does require
a proper training and safety procedures to
[SPEAKER_00]: be understood and followed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe because you are creating that
supercritical carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there are some advantages and
disadvantages of each, but typically this
[SPEAKER_00]: process will require additional steps
after.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this can be a great way to kind of
start the refinement process, start the
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction process, and may be worthwhile
exploring for your operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
