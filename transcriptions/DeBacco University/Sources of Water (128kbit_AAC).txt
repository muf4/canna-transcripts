[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're irrigating our crops,
we want to be considering what source of
[SPEAKER_00]: water we're going to utilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the common ones are rainwater,
pond water, city or tap water,
[SPEAKER_00]: and well water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to cover each of these sources
briefly just to give you some background
[SPEAKER_00]: on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, rainwater can be easily
collected by simply having a rain barrel
[SPEAKER_00]: or collecting it off a roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, this can be an unreliable source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time, when it rains a lot,
especially for outdoor operations,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't need to irrigate a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it doesn't rain, you don't have a
lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of water reserves and your plants
need irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes you can kind of be working
against yourself there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as easy as setting up a rain barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually 12 states that regulate
the collection of rainwater that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've chosen to highlight Colorado here
because it is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the source right down here at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2009, Colorado legislation session
passed a bill that allows limited
[SPEAKER_00]: rainwater collection for properties
supplied by a well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even then, residents must apply for a
permit to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why I just let you know that
it's actually illegal to collect
[SPEAKER_00]: rainwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes in certain states,
there are certain processes to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is simply hooking up some pipes
to a rooftop gutter system here and
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go on to pond water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pond water can be variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at kind of more of a natural
surroundings to this pond in here a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more than earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and go ahead and look at
some of the different types of water that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and look at some of the
different types of water that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while this wouldn't be a very efficient
method shown here, this gives you an idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of water is basically passed by a UV
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can help sterilize it and limit
the chance of contaminating your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and your soil or your container growing
media with naturally occurring microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: that might be present in pond water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tap or city water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actual contents depend on the physical
location, even town to town.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can relate to what they're adding to
that to help reduce and potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminate hopefully the microbes that
would be growing in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this could be chlorine, chloridamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole bunch of different types
of basically sterilants that are used.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it can vary from town to town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likely contain some form of chlorine and
salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your water tested or call your water
torrent for a current report.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very good about reporting and
providing you with that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's advised to check the tap water during
the year to see if changes occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could be areas if there's a lot
of tourists that come in, higher demands
[SPEAKER_00]: on water, summertime versus winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to just get an idea to see if
there are changes that do occur over the
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same idea should be applied to tap
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a likelihood of greater changes as
possible with well water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of classified as hard water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains a lot of minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature is another factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a cold shock to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may need to be heated before it's
applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is of particular importance for very
deep wells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, with all wells you should watch the
flow rate and the well replenish rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: How quick will that well replenish the
water that's in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say well, typically they're not open
wells like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have kind of the bucket on the rope.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're typically drilled and this is one
that was recently drilled in the area
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the sand around it,
but they're drilled down and just be
[SPEAKER_00]: mindful to not run your well dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be mindful of the flow rate that it can
support and also the rate it can replenish
[SPEAKER_00]: itself so that you're able to keep that
well as a reliable water source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
