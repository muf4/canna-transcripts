[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this DeBaca University video
where we're heading out to the botanist.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a dispensary facility and we'll be
conducting an interview with the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacist, Uzma Zakir.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Kira along to help some of the
interviews, so hope you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, it's Kira and today we're at the
botanist so that we could interview the
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmacist, Uzma Zakir.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to ask her a little bit about
herself, about questions about the
[SPEAKER_03]: botanist, their educational outreach,
some misconceptions that people may have,
[SPEAKER_03]: and just other general information about
being a medical patient over at the
[SPEAKER_03]: botanist.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good morning, thank you so much for
joining us today for an interview.
[SPEAKER_03]: To start, just introduce yourself,
give us a background, tell us what you do
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Uzma Zakir and I'm a pharmacist
and I've been a dispensary pharmacist
[SPEAKER_02]: since 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where we get to treat patients using
marijuana as their medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a very, very rewarding
experience and it's amazing to be a part
[SPEAKER_01]: of something that's evolving and
progressing so quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the botanist we really pride ourselves
in our education department where we do
[SPEAKER_02]: keep up to date with the current
cannabinoid research, really keeping close
[SPEAKER_02]: relationships with the growers and
understanding their products, and then
[SPEAKER_02]: putting that together to really see how
much this plant can do for us and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: been such a remarkable experience to see
how much patients improve when they do get
[SPEAKER_02]: their medical marijuana card and work with
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how does somebody get started in the
process of becoming a medical patient at
[SPEAKER_03]: the botanist?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is a two-step process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first your doctor has to determine that
you have one of the 38 qualifying
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions and then your doctor will enter
your certification into the state system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the patient completes an online
application where you need a valid
[SPEAKER_02]: government issued ID as well as proof of
residency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can be a little complicated so we
help patients by appointment to help them
[SPEAKER_02]: complete that part of the application.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great of you guys to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything that patients should
keep in mind while going through this
[SPEAKER_03]: process?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah there is a hundred dollar fee to the
state that we currently reimburse to our
[SPEAKER_02]: patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you describe the different delivery
methods and how someone could best utilize
[SPEAKER_03]: each of them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really great that we have such a wide
range of delivery systems because it can
[SPEAKER_02]: really, the program can really get
tailored for a patient's individual needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is of course flower to smoke and
there's vaping products.
[SPEAKER_02]: After that there's so many choices which
is great because many patients come to us
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't want to smoke or vape and they
can still get the full benefit of the
[SPEAKER_02]: program using things like oral solutions
which are like dropper bottles,
[SPEAKER_02]: tablets, capsules.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's baked goods, there's even topicals
which can help with a whole range of
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so great that there's so many
different ways to go about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is really great because everyone has
their own individual needs and really
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding and I think my favorite part
about what I do is just talking to
[SPEAKER_02]: patients, understanding their lifestyle
and really getting an idea of what's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to work for them to empower them and just
give them the right tools in their toolbox
[SPEAKER_02]: and delivery systems are really important
because also the delivery system
[SPEAKER_02]: determines how quickly a medication is
going to take effect and also how long the
[SPEAKER_02]: duration of action is, how long it's going
to last.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really nice to tailor very
specifically for each patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are cannabinoids and how do they
differ from terpenes?
[SPEAKER_02]: So cannabinoids and terpenes are from two
different families of molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cannabinoids are the molecular
components of the cannabis plant that
[SPEAKER_02]: actually makes cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it works physiologically in our body
with our endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terpenes are aromatic compounds that
actually exist in all plants, fruits and
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example lavender is very high in
linalool which makes lavender very
[SPEAKER_02]: relaxing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most common terpenes found in the
cannabis plant are beta-mercine,
[SPEAKER_02]: beta-carotene, triethylene, linalool,
limonene and pining and in Connecticut
[SPEAKER_02]: they're measured and they're on the
product labels and that really can help us
[SPEAKER_02]: give us an idea of how a particular
harvest is going to make a patient feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some general precautions and
warnings that you would give to your
[SPEAKER_03]: patients prior to coming here and
ordering?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would definitely say make that
consultation with your pharmacist.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of our locations have really great
medical cannabis pharmacists that are here
[SPEAKER_02]: to help you and assist you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're pharmacists we also
understand your medications from your
[SPEAKER_02]: regular doctor and your pharmaceutical
medications.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can go through your regular
medication list, make sure that there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: drug interactions and then introduce
cannabis safely into your medication
[SPEAKER_01]: regime.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have never used cannabis before
that's totally okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have lots of different products that
have no psychoactive effect if that's what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're looking for but you're still
looking for that relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so really starting off with low doses,
speaking to your pharmacist on how to
[SPEAKER_02]: safely titrate up and explore different
options and different regimens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what makes medical cannabis
unique is that you have a guide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I love doing the most is
getting to know the patients, getting to
[SPEAKER_02]: know what they need and what they're
looking for and then being able to set
[SPEAKER_01]: them up on something to empower them on
getting better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi everyone, it's Kiara.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here to talk about my story being a
medical patient at The Botanist.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I first qualified to get my med
card I thought it was pretty difficult to
[SPEAKER_03]: find really a home base for a dispensary
because a lot of places are pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: variable with their products, with their
customer service, hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I find that The Botanist is very
consistent and that's what I really like
[SPEAKER_03]: about this place is that there's always
great customers service, I'm in and out
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty quickly, you know, it's quick but
not hurried.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of these products here, you can see
that they have lab testing for
[SPEAKER_03]: microbiology, micro toxins, heavy metals,
pesticides, which of course are not things
[SPEAKER_03]: that you want to be consuming.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's really great to know right on
the bottle that you're not getting any of
[SPEAKER_03]: that in your product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in my opinion, one thing that really
sets The Botanist apart from other
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries is how informative they are
to their customers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to worry when you come to
The Botanist because they will let you
[SPEAKER_03]: know exactly what you're going to get
yourself into.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no confusion.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have so many options here and I just
really love how transparent they are with
[SPEAKER_03]: everything and how helpful they are as a
dispensary in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I always come back to The
Botanist no matter where I go it seems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here at The Botanist we really
understand the endocannabinoid system and
[SPEAKER_02]: the science behind cannabis as medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the endocannabinoid system,
I really like to take the time out to
[SPEAKER_02]: explain to patients why cannabis works as
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really amazing to see patients
when they realize that just like we have a
[SPEAKER_02]: cardiovascular system or an endocrine
system, we also have an endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: system that the molecules in the cannabis
plant that make cannabis medicine are
[SPEAKER_02]: called cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we call them phytocannabinoids because
they come from a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But lo and behold, the human body actually
makes its own versions of these
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're called endogenous cannabinoids
because they come from the inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the two most prominent are anandamide
and 2-AG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anandamide was actually named after
the Sanskrit word for bliss or supreme
[SPEAKER_02]: joy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do these work in the body?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they work like a lock and key on our
cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the cannabinoid 1 receptor is actually
the most prevalent receptor in our central
[SPEAKER_02]: nervous system.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means you have more receptors for
cannabinoids in your central nervous
[SPEAKER_02]: system than for anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a really phenomenal statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cannabinoid 2 receptors are mostly
found on your immune system, your tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: cells, your organs, and even in your skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are all these compounds doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got these receptors and we even have
enzymes that work on the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have our endogenous cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, scientists put it all together.
[SPEAKER_02]: They named it the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is really a complex molecular
signaling system that really helps
[SPEAKER_02]: regulate almost every physiological
function in the human body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why when you look at a state
qualifying conditions list, there's so
[SPEAKER_02]: many different types of illnesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're looking at something like ALS,
which is neurodegenerative or
[SPEAKER_02]: neuroinflammatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there's also PTSD on the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also Crohn's disease on the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how this explains, the endocannabinoid
system explains why one plant is good for
[SPEAKER_02]: so many different disease states.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the cannabinoid 2 receptors on our
immune system is really what helps
[SPEAKER_02]: modulate inflammation and why cannabinoids
are such potent anti-inflammatories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then with the cannabinoid 1 receptors,
if we just look for an example of pain,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, in our central nervous
system, it's actually been shown in
[SPEAKER_02]: studies that our cannabinoids actually
modulate every step of the pain processing
[SPEAKER_02]: pathway in the human body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's ascending pathways, descending
pathways, and the cannabinoids are there
[SPEAKER_02]: playing a part in all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, it's just so much potential for
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more you learn, the more you want to
help people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work with patients who suffer from
fatigue because of some of their
[SPEAKER_02]: illnesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be an autoimmune arthritis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be fibromyalgia.
[SPEAKER_02]: But fatigue is a top symptom or cheap
complaint for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's really remarkable is when you
start working with patients and you get
[SPEAKER_02]: them to sleep properly through the night,
you get them on the right cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe CBD during the day, you really start
fighting that inflammation.
[SPEAKER_02]: They start relieving their symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in a better mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then lo and behold, they have more
energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patients have come back and said to me,
well, I didn't think getting something
[SPEAKER_02]: from the pop place would give me more
energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it has.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really fighting that stereotype
that people who use marijuana are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be sitting on the couch ordering pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, our patients are getting back into
the gym.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting back to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're walking their dogs again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're loving more parts of their
life or more parts of their day.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do believe that all illness,
right, you're going to have to include the
[SPEAKER_02]: mind, body, and the spirit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel that that's why cannabis has
helped so many people, is that not only
[SPEAKER_02]: does it relieve your pain, it also puts
you in a better mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is one of the reasons why,
in a lot of studies, cannabis is a more
[SPEAKER_02]: successful pain reliever than opioids.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because of that mood component.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understanding that patients have gone
through a lot in their health journey
[SPEAKER_02]: before they have even come through our
door.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we really like to focus on being
sympathetic and compassionate and
[SPEAKER_02]: completely non-judgmental.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have patients that have been using
cannabis for years or decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have many patients who've never
used it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: We welcome everyone the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have something for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we really like to tailor our services
to everyone for their uniqueness as an
[SPEAKER_02]: individual.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we look at our products,
and one thing that's great about
[SPEAKER_02]: Connecticut is that we do have a lot of
information on the label.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the cannabinoid potency,
so how much THC or CBD, and as well as the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now terpenes are really important because
we like to put together the strain,
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabinoid potency, as well as the
terpene profile to really give a good kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of estimate on how that particular harvest
is going to make a patient feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you may have a classic indica strain
that's maybe very high in THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we look at the terpene profile,
and maybe it's very high in pining and
[SPEAKER_02]: limonene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, patients have come back and told us,
well, that's really good for focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we'll say, OK, well, you know,
perhaps that particular harvest is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to hit more like a hybrid and not just be
an indica that's going to put you to
[SPEAKER_02]: sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when patients call or come in and
they're looking for a recommendation,
[SPEAKER_02]: my advice is tell me what delivery system
you want to use and how you want to feel
[SPEAKER_02]: and let us do the rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some common misconceptions that
I'd like to clear up, because I think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: intimidating, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And patients may not want to get their
card or come to the dispensary,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're missing out on so much
potential benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: A really common thing that I hear is,
I don't want to get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is no problem whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can cover your symptoms from morning to
night with cannabinoids that are not going
[SPEAKER_02]: to give you a psychoactive effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you never have to smoke or vape.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some patients do not feel comfortable with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's completely OK, because we have
so many different types of delivery
[SPEAKER_02]: systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you never have to smoke or vape.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can still get that full benefit
from the program.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the favorite things about my job is
hosting the monthly canna convos.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have monthly virtual sessions where
patients can join.
[SPEAKER_02]: General population and even providers from
other states have joined.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talk about insomnia and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about chronic illness and PTSD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to share the current
cannabinoid research that's going on,
[SPEAKER_02]: how I implement it, and how our
pharmacists, because we also do staff
[SPEAKER_02]: education as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we share our knowledge and how we can
really use the current research in
[SPEAKER_02]: treating our patients every single day
with the products in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that can look like targeted cannabinoid
therapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can look like not using THC all the
time or not using just CBD all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other minor cannabinoids,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's THCA.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's CBN that we have in the program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really understanding how you can use
different delivery systems, different
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids at different times of day to
get 24-hour relief of your symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really just having those right
tools in your toolbox to really get back
[SPEAKER_02]: control of your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it becomes a beautiful cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our patients have even given us
feedback saying, my favorite part about
[SPEAKER_02]: these events is that I feel like I belong
to a community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because really, it's also about removing
the stigma from using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about using marijuana as medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have patients that are even judged by
their own family members for how they
[SPEAKER_02]: choose to medicate and treat their
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wanted them to know that we're here
for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all in on this together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really sharing the knowledge of why
cannabis is medicine using scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: evidence is so empowering for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really helps patients feel more
comfortable and strong in their decision
[SPEAKER_02]: to use cannabis as their medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the monthly events are definitely one
of my favorite parts of the job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so coming up, I'm going to be doing
cannabis and pain management, which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: huge topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for Valentine's Day in February,
we're going to do PTSD and relationships.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we also do for our education
department is spend time with certifiers,
[SPEAKER_02]: providers, and doctors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really getting them to understand what
we're doing here at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, talking about how we do the
consultations, how we review patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medication lists, all other diagnoses that
they may have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the body is just one body.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all connected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what's amazing about the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps regulate all of the physiological
functions in the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really have to understand what's
going on everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to really push for the
potential of the plant to see what this
[SPEAKER_02]: plant can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that really kind of keeps me going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my name is Uzma.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the director of outreach for our three
dispensaries here in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Botanist in Montville, The Botanist in
Danbury, and Prime Wellness of Connecticut
[SPEAKER_02]: in South Windsor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can visit us at our website,
shopbotanist.com, or
[SPEAKER_02]: primewellnessofconnecticut.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on Instagram, thebotanist.ct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can also contact me on Instagram,
thecannabisole.
Thank you.
