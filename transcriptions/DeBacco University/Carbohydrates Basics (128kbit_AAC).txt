[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to provide a quick
overview of carbohydrate basics,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the general run-through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we may think of them as bread
and pasta, we're looking at them a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more from a molecular level here in
this presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, carbohydrates are often
referred to as sugars, and they do fit
[SPEAKER_00]: that general category.
[SPEAKER_00]: They provide the building materials and
energy storage, and this is why we
[SPEAKER_00]: typically associate them with bread,
because that is a pretty dense energy
[SPEAKER_00]: storage food item.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are molecules that contain carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you get the name
carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part is not only do they contain
those elements, but they are in a one to
[SPEAKER_00]: two to one ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one carbon atom to two hydrogens to
one oxygen ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what defines them as carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two main types.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's simple and there's complex,
and we're looking here at some more
[SPEAKER_00]: complex ones in the image with the bread
and the pasta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at comparing these simple and
what defines a simple carbohydrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, simple carbohydrates are called
monosaccharides and disaccharides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mono meaning one, one sugar, saccharides
meaning sugar, so one sugar, means they
[SPEAKER_00]: consist of one subunit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have heard of glucose or fructose
or galactose.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all monosaccharides.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit bigger here would be
disaccharides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Di meaning two, saccharides meaning sugar,
and they consist of two subunits.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, sucrose are two monomers that
are linked together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a lactose and a glucose linked
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here lactose is actually two
glucose molecules linked together forming
[SPEAKER_00]: this disaccharide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these fall into the category of
simple carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we get a little bit further,
we get a little more into the complex
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: A complex carbohydrate consists of long
polymers of sugar, subunits, and poly
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning many.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be three, four, to hundreds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally, as we can see here,
polysaccharides, many sugars linked
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all consist of potentially those
monomer units that we saw there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just many of them being linked
together making these complex
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's just a quick look at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monosaccharide, disaccharide, and
polysaccharide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monosaccharide, as an example,
is glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disaccharide here, we have sucrose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they're linked together,
not just two monosaccharides hanging out
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually linked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one down here is a
polysaccharide, and that's amylose here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see many, many of these units
linked together is the key part.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at these complex
carbohydrates, they fall into many
[SPEAKER_00]: categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we have starch being an
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starch provides energy storage in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important energy storage molecule for
the plant world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glycogen here provides energy storage in
animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both complex carbohydrates,
but there's different forms for different
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cellulose is found in the plant walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what gives them their strength and
rigidity, also high amounts of energy that
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't really, as humans, not able to
break down all that well versus other
[SPEAKER_00]: animals that have a more complex digestive
system are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chitin is found in cell walls of fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: In insects and exoskeletons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a blue crab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of chitin in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very dense outer shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a carbohydrate, but again,
we're typically going after the meat on
[SPEAKER_00]: the inside because we can flak the ability
to break down the great degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity of the chitin that's in the
shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, within these carbohydrates,
they function for energy, raw materials,
[SPEAKER_00]: energy storage, structural components.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of ways that our body can
utilize in metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is glucose as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, that's a monosaccharide,
a single sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starches, cellulose, and glycogen are
other examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that starch and cellulose are
much more complex, and our digestive
[SPEAKER_00]: system may have a harder time breaking
those down because they are so complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting into isomers, so looking at the
different molecules or molecular formulas
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we're looking at carbohydrates,
this is actually the same molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people initially look at this and
say, oh, they're different molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: formulas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually the same molecular formula
in other molecule, but has a different
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the same formula, the same number
of atoms, but organized in a different
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they both have the same number of
atoms in each element, but different
[SPEAKER_00]: arrangements of those atoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see that taking shape here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where there is this change, there is this
different shape here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, same atoms, they're just kind of
jumbled in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, structural isomers we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: N-butane, isobutane, and kind of the
carbons are kind of highlighted here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bright colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that if you count up,
the number of atoms are all the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: the same ratio, but they look very
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're structurally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we get into carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start talking about what's called cis
and trans.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is cis stands for adjacent,
both on the same side, and trans is a
[SPEAKER_00]: cross from.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes this important is if you start
looking at things, and I have a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: examples here, if you have a molecule that
only has a single bond in the middle,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, what that's going to cause is this
molecule can turn and spin, and that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to really lend itself to being cis
or trans.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the cis and trans
carbohydrates here a little bit closer
[SPEAKER_00]: now, you could see that over here there's
a double bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that double bond allows for is a
fixed point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't rotate like I just showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in a double bond, we have the cis
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's that double bond, and these carbon
atoms and these hydrogen atoms,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, they can't turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can move slightly here, but they
can't turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, we have cis being on the same
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need that double bond here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need that double bond here for
trans, because again, these can't rotate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, we do have them evident on
either side here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be the trans form here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, our trans form, and this would be
our cis form.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're looking at comparing to the
pictures I have just behind us,
[SPEAKER_00]: this would be the trans form.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be the cis form there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I make myself a little bit smaller,
we could see how clearly we could see that
[SPEAKER_00]: difference here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that trans form being evident here,
and that cis form located here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that difference there, all because
of that double bond fixing those atoms in
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if we have those single bond causes
an issue, causes spinning, not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: set up well for cis or trans here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within our nomenclature, we have what's
called D-glucose and L-glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically referring to the
organization of the hydroxide group here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at sugar nomenclature
for sugars, more than one chiral center,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll talk about chiral centers in a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a carbon molecule with four
different atoms attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the D and the L refers to the
asymmetric C, that's the carbon,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the aldehyde or ketone group.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see an aldehyde or a ketone,
looking at how these are being arranged.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most naturally occurring sugars are
the D isomers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our bodies have enzymes that are very
dependent on shape, and that D-glucose is
[SPEAKER_00]: something our body might be able to
metabolize, where that L-glucose and we
[SPEAKER_00]: may lack those enzymes for it to break
that down efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: That chiral center, as I mentioned,
molecules consists of at least one carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: atom and four non-identical things
attached to it, substituents.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is allowing this chiral, this four
different attachment points allows there
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a left side and a right side,
a difference amongst those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That chiral center is that carbon with the
four different items attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Optical isomers, mirror images are not the
same, so this important correlation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are mirror images of one another,
but they're not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different arrangement of the
four different groups around that center
[SPEAKER_00]: atom that we see located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: D and L sugars are mirror images of one
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the same name, D-glucose and
L-glucose, but different enzymes would be
[SPEAKER_00]: required to break those down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly here, to help prove that mirror
images are not the same, your left and
[SPEAKER_00]: right hand are not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, of course they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you hold them up to one another
here, and you'll notice that they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: match up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do this, you say, oh look,
now they match up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one's facing one way, one's facing
the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you're seeing my palm, here you're
seeing the back of my hand, those are not
[SPEAKER_00]: the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or for them to be identical, you need to
be able to lay over one another perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here, both back of my
hands, the thumbs are not matching up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about shaking someone's hand,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just goes to prove that your left and
right hand, while they all have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: components, are not identical copies of
one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are mirror images, and that's a very
important distinction.
