[SPEAKER_00]: While two greenhouses may look very
similar in structure, there are many
[SPEAKER_00]: options when it comes to covering a
greenhouse or what type of plastic or
[SPEAKER_00]: glass or copolymer do you use to act as a
barrier between the outside environment
[SPEAKER_00]: and how to protect your plants on the
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, greenhouses sometimes are
called glass houses because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they used to be made out of entirely
glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glass is great because it offers excellent
or high percentage of light transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have a very long service life,
potentially decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, with some pros also come some
cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this material can shatter if it gets
loose, if there's wind, if there's snow
[SPEAKER_00]: load, and it's typically more expensive
material than some of the other options
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be tempered glass to prevent
shattering or breaking of a panel that can
[SPEAKER_00]: help protect not only the plants,
but the people working in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when it's using glass, the panels,
even for small panels for their size,
[SPEAKER_00]: can be very heavy and hard to transport
and store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polycarbonate is another option.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a strong lightweight material
that's almost as transparent as glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's considered by some to be the jack of
all trades due to its durability and ease
[SPEAKER_00]: with working.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lasts for about 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good, for most growers,
good longevity, and it can be used on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, straight panels, or it can also,
in some cases, be added to true hoop
[SPEAKER_00]: houses, and that's polycarbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polyethylene is the least expensive
covering material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like this cling wrap is
something to think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does come in different thicknesses,
typically three mil to eight mil is the
[SPEAKER_00]: general kind of variance that it comes in,
and that stands for millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically it only lasts for about four
years, and that's the average material,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's wind, there's a lot of
stressors on that plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six mil is considered, in general,
to be the standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three mil is kind of used for that
one-time use, so that small structures,
[SPEAKER_00]: eight mil can be a little bit stronger in
environments that are needing of that
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit thicker polyethylene covering.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different types of polyethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's anti-condensation ones,
which reduces the dripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, but this can also reduce or impact
some of the light transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be thermally protected if
you're looking at using this structure in
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly colder months.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's delivered in large rolls of plastic,
which can make installation, at least the
[SPEAKER_00]: first part of installation, a little
challenging, especially if it's a windy
[SPEAKER_00]: day, which you can kind of get everyone
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any wind, this large sail, can easily
catch that and make it very difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: install.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's copolymers and resins,
ethylene, tetrafluoroethylene is a
[SPEAKER_00]: copolymer.
[SPEAKER_00]: ETFE film is what it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a high-performance film.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes through the trade name Fclean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has potential benefits over all of the
previous mentioned covering materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a very high light transmission at
about 93, also allows UV light at about
[SPEAKER_00]: 94%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can help with anthocyanin
production in the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a non-stick surface, so it does allow
for easy snow removal, and it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: durable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can last 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of what it may look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some structures made out of it
because it's a resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It originates as these kind of little
plastic beads that are melted together to
[SPEAKER_00]: form this particular covering material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I provide a little link here if you
want to check out this particular one in
[SPEAKER_00]: more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now considering covering's insulation
ability, so this is something worth
[SPEAKER_00]: considering here, is the insulation of a
particular covering quote, greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important when you're growing in
particularly cold weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, for plastics, having two layers
inflated versus not having them inflated
[SPEAKER_00]: can have a big impact on the insulation or
R value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Single petal glass has an R value of .95
compared to a double layer petal of .2.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this means is that the bigger the
number, the greater the insulating factor
[SPEAKER_00]: and the less heat you're going to lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is an example of hemp insulation,
but as you can see, there's no light
[SPEAKER_00]: transmission here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to be mindful of that,
that we still want to maintain good
[SPEAKER_00]: insulation ability, also good light
penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, double paneling is typically a
more efficient choice for greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: glazed with glass, and also polytunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: A house should be easily insulated,
but again, not allowing light through.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is looking at an infrared camera,
and where the red and white is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see a lot more heat escaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, this roof is causing a lot
of heat and very warm in comparison to the
[SPEAKER_00]: sidewalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: That R value or that insulation I talked
about is a commercial unit used to measure
[SPEAKER_00]: effectiveness of thermal insulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: How well does it restrict or resist
conduction of heat?
[SPEAKER_00]: The larger the number, it represents a
higher insulation value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is R21, this is a very high value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greater heating and cooling efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this material has a very high
R value because it's not allowing the heat
[SPEAKER_00]: from this blowtorch to ignite any of these
matches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly here, looking at some greenhouse
coverings, installations, and R values,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at some of the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specific brand names, product R values may
vary slightly from these figures,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this gives you a general idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the website where I got this from.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows the blower of inflating and
creating a two wall or a double layer,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say, polyethylene structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the difference here between
double layer inflated R value versus just
[SPEAKER_00]: regular 6 mil polyethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the double or twin wall, you could see
an increase, so that's definitely worth
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration, even though it will be
increased cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at growing during the
cold months, having a high R value is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely well worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you welcome to pause the video here to
take a look at this further, but this is,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, provides you with a general
comparison of some polycarbonate,
[SPEAKER_00]: some polyethylene, and some glass,
just to give you an idea of their
[SPEAKER_00]: insulating or R factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
