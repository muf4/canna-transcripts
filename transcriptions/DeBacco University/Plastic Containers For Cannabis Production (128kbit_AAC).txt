[SPEAKER_00]: So in this Tabaco University video,
I'm going to cover plastic containers for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look more at plastic
containers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, when we're looking at
plastic containers, they're very popular
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're popular for a good reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're made in a wide variety of shapes,
sizes, and colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: These shapes, they're round, or they could
be the square type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sizes, they could be under a gallon to all
the way up to potentially 25 gallons or
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes even slightly greater than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In colors, from a black pot to a white pot
and a whole bunch of colors in between,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are a lot of options when you're
looking at plastic containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say the round black pots tends to
be the most consistent or most popular,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are other options that are
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, plastic is considered to be kind of
the standard as far as containers go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plastic containers are often the least
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be easy to use and very
simple to clean, which is contributing
[SPEAKER_00]: factors to why they're considered to be
the standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not be currently kind of a trendy
kind of container to use, but they are
[SPEAKER_00]: still very effective and they're still
used quite on the large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the reasons why some people may not
like a plastic container to utilize for
[SPEAKER_00]: their growing area is that plants can
become root bound in plastic pots due to
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal natural aeration because of the
impermeable material there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will reduce the plant's access to
nutrients and also water absorption,
[SPEAKER_00]: may even hinder the ability for the plants
to aerate themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, ensuring that the substrate has
natural porosity can help reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: negative impacts of plastic containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the image we see here, we see a very
solid root mass here along the sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we don't see very many roots at
the very bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also see kind of where the drainage
hole was here right in this vicinity here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the sharp angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see kind of some discoloration to the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just important things to keep
in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while there might be some drawbacks,
these plastic pots are the most popular
[SPEAKER_00]: for good reason because of a lot of the
benefits that they bring and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the standard process and also
reusability in some cases to help reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: any sort of cost and help maximize plant
production.
