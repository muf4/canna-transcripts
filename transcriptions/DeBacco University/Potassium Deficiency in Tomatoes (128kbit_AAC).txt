[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at potassium
deficiency in tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see kind of a great image here of
initial onset of a potassium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell you what potassium does in the tomato
plant and how to correct or prevent a
[SPEAKER_00]: potential deficiency in your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, potassium just in general,
what does it do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do plants need it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that it is a mobile nutrient
so plants can kind of move or translocate
[SPEAKER_00]: that through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants deficient potassium tend to be less
resistant to environmental stresses,
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases, nematode attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's important for growers to
make sure their plants are not becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, it can also affect quality
such as shape, the color, the vigor,
[SPEAKER_00]: the size of the actual tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can actually cause a yellow shouldering
as well as we see that kind of up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Activates up to 60 enzymes involved with
growth, helps translocate sugars and
[SPEAKER_00]: starches within the plant, increases
protein content, maintains trigger
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure, its water pressure, reduces
water loss and wilting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see this is involved in a lot
of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most notably, as I said, for the
marketable fruit, yellow shouldering is
[SPEAKER_00]: one kind of issue that can occur and not
allow customers to even pick up your item
[SPEAKER_00]: and to purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to better show a deficiency,
I chose to grow tomato plants in a
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponic setup in a greenhouse which
allowed for precise control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also going to see a comparison of a
control plant that had the optimum rates
[SPEAKER_00]: of all nutrients and then a test plant was
potassium deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of shows the image here of
the potassium deficient plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will start to get a yellowing kind of
color to them towards the margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see that right here,
here and here and these are the older
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the original root stock would be all
the way to the right of the image here and
[SPEAKER_00]: above me here is kind of the newer growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically those older leaves are
impacted first.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will have the first ones to show this
yellowing or this discoloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's important to keep in mind of
where you might be seeing the yellowing
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, where they might be occurring
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the older leaves and towards the
margins, you may have a potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on our older leaves, this kind of
shows that newer part of the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, they start to get that
yellowing first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the newer growth may look perfectly
fine and normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind that while they look
normal now, if no corrective measures are
[SPEAKER_00]: taken, they will start to exhibit the same
yellowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to make sure that you're
looking at those older leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: understand, oh, they're all going to die
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be a sign of something
progressing through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice compared to the control plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, the minus potassium to
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice the newer growth looks very
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green pattern looks the same, but we do
not see that yellowing of the leaf margins
[SPEAKER_00]: of the older leaves in the control one
that was fed a balanced fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how to prevent this or how to correct
the potential deficiency, if you do notice
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, keep in mind, potassium is important
for fruit finishing in the end yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be something you might see a
little bit later in the season or past
[SPEAKER_00]: flower fruit set.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to be needed in that more mid to
late season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfate upon ash 0050 is 50% potassium,
typically applied based on a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has a very low salt level and only adds
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a great product to choose, especially
if you can add it to the soil before the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants go in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium chlorides, one that's very
commonly used, 0061.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a greater percentage of
potassium, a higher percent of that
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the sulfate upon ash that I
mentioned previously, but it does have
[SPEAKER_00]: more salts with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelp used by a lot of organic growers,
great source of potassium, usually about a
[SPEAKER_00]: teaspoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of powder or two ounces of liquid per
gallon can be applied to the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, keep in mind that while it is a
source of potassium, it's nowhere near the
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 or 60% of the two previous products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not really concentrated enough to
typically correct a deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to kind of supplement and keep
the plants going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have a deficiency, it may take
a lot, a lot of kelp and excessive amounts
[SPEAKER_00]: of kelp almost to that point to correct a
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind that while it
does have potassium, it's not nearly as
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated as the other fertilizers that
I've mentioned here.
