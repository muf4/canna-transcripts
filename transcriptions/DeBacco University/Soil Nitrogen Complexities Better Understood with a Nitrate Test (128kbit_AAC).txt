[SPEAKER_00]: In this Debaco University video,
I hope to try to reduce some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: complications when looking at nitrogen as
a fertilizer when trying to grow plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nitrogen may just be one nutrient,
but it can perform a lot of different kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of transitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can become very complex in the
different forms that it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hope here is to try to reduce some of
those complexities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at soil nitrogen
complexities to better understood with a
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end, some fertilizer
recommendations will be provided,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least in general, to act as a general
summary here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the impact of nitrogen on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen is an important nutrient to be
looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because it's part of all living
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen promotes green leaf growth and
lack of nitrogen commonly can limit plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants uptake nitrogen in the form of
nitrate, NO3, or ammonium, NH4,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the nitrate form being preferred by
many garden plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not only just the nutrient,
it's also the molecule that comes in to
[SPEAKER_00]: help impact and change how it might be
uptake by a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, why focus on nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, even if levels of all other
nutrients are sufficient, you may still
[SPEAKER_00]: need to add nitrogen each year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite the many different nutrients in
the soil, nitrogen is likely to be
[SPEAKER_00]: deficient if not managed properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen is variable, so understanding and
managing it can be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proper management of nitrogen will help
ensure optimum crop performance and
[SPEAKER_00]: minimize the potential negative
environmental impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why you need to continually
usually fertilize with nitrogen is because
[SPEAKER_00]: it has a tendency to leach from the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: While other minerals tend to hold in the
soil a little bit longer, nitrogen has a
[SPEAKER_00]: tendency to leach out from year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at nitrogen
recommendations related to a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that since nitrogen levels
can fluctuate widely depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions, it can change
during the shipping process of that soil
[SPEAKER_00]: test as it goes from where you sampled it
to the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This element is not measured in a routine
soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why there's this thing called a
June nitrate test, which test is
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically and only for nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nitrogen recommendations are based on
crop needs as an estimate by field studies
[SPEAKER_00]: combined with presumptive of the
presumption that little available nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: remains in the soil at the end of the
growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we just see some examples of
looking at nitrogen recommendations,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at cotton, nitrogen removal,
and pounds per bushel of corn and
[SPEAKER_00]: soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's good that you have some
sort of crop to match this up with,
[SPEAKER_00]: but hopefully with all of these can kind
of develop that general sense of what's a
[SPEAKER_00]: good target level when we're taking a June
nitrate test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nitrogen cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, nitrogen has many different chemical
forms, and it changes as part of the full
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are more plant available than others,
and that's an important consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all nitrogen can be uptaken by plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen makes up the vast majority of the
air, about 78%, but this is only usable by
[SPEAKER_00]: legumes, which can fix this form into
other plant available forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though plants are constantly
exposed to atmospheric nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the vast majority, 78% of the air
around them, most plants other than
[SPEAKER_00]: legumes cannot utilize that form of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at mainly the nitrates
being what's being able to be absorbed by
[SPEAKER_00]: plants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also some ammonia as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But others can be leached out and not
uptaken by plants, so not only do we need
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen in the soil and around the plant,
we need it in the proper form for uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some commercial nitrogen
fertilizers?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have the ammonia, which includes
inhydrosammonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at room temperature, ammonia is a
colorless, pungent-smelling gas that is
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter than air.
[SPEAKER_00]: At minus 28 degrees Fahrenheit,
ammonia is stored as a liquid,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ammonia easily dissolves in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes it an efficient form of
delivery to plants, but it must be
[SPEAKER_00]: injected below the soil surface to be
delivered to plants so it's not commonly
[SPEAKER_00]: done in rocky soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to literally be injected below
the soil surface as it's going right
[SPEAKER_00]: along.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go through and inject it
below the soil surface and cover it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have rocky soils, the point of
injection can break, and therefore it's
[SPEAKER_00]: typically not used in soils that tend to
be very rocky or regions of the country
[SPEAKER_00]: that tend to be rocky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium nitrate of 15-0-0 is water soluble
and fast-acting form of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urea is very potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 46-0-0, 46% nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very efficient source of nitrogen,
but requires soil microbes to change its
[SPEAKER_00]: form of nitrogen to become
plant-available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's best if incorporated into the soil or
watered in shortly after application to
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid nitrogen being lost to
volatilization, where it becomes a gas and
[SPEAKER_00]: goes into the atmosphere and not uptaken
by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also organic forms of nitrogen
fertilizer, such as manures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have high levels of
plant-available amounts of nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you want to watch the type of bedding
that may come with the manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if it's sawdust or other fine
wood products, this will reduce the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of plant-available nitrogen because it may
actually be uptaken as part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposition process of that sawdust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's soil organic matter,
and nitrogen is released in the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: mineralization as organic matter,
as soil microbes break down that organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of have this kind of process going
on in the soil when it gets to a proper
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a blood meal here,
listed as a 12-1-0, 12% nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a high-nitrogen content organic
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, changing forms of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you see, we have nitrification,
which is the biological process of
[SPEAKER_00]: converting ammonia, which is NH4+,
to nitrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nitrate N is negatively charged,
as we can see right here in ion,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is not attracted to soil particles or
soil organic matter, like the ammonium is,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's more commonly easy to leach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have two negative particles,
they're going to kind of repel one
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, that's going to have a
tendency to leach out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's denitrification, which is
bacteria converting NO3 to NO2 gas,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that kind of the NO2 gas will be lost
to the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be through the process here of
volatilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then with immobilization, this is when
nitrogen is assembled into compounds or
[SPEAKER_00]: materials that is not available,
such as plant residues, it's another way
[SPEAKER_00]: we can, quote, lose nitrogen or have
nitrogen that cannot be of benefit to the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop we're trying to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how can nitrogen be lost?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say lost in the sense that we know
where it goes, but lost in the sense it
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot be uptake or utilized by the plant
we're intending to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be leaching, and this is
physically loss of nitrogen due to excess
[SPEAKER_00]: water additions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's most likely to occur in sandier
soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: The denitrification is typical loss of
nitrogen, and it can initiate forms when
[SPEAKER_00]: soil is saturated with water for two to
three days, particularly prolonged rain
[SPEAKER_00]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Volatilization is when the surface applied
nitrogen is not incorporated into the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, it's just applied on top,
because this can lead to nitrogen being
[SPEAKER_00]: lost to the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conditions that increase the rate of
volatilization is a soil pH higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: 7.3, also hot to air temperatures in a
moist soil surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the hot of summer on a basic
soil with just after a rain, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve the efficiency to be volatilized
and not uptaken by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also crop removal we must take
into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is simply removing plant material
that has nitrogen in it will naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce nitrogen in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually how the majority of
nitrogen leaves the soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the crop is harvested and taken off
site, the nitrogen that's in that plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: also removed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's soil erosion and runoff,
and these should be minimized for the
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons in addition to nitrogen loss,
but also don't want to be losing your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why cover crops are highly
recommended in open fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's two key forms of nitrogen,
as I said, that ammonium and that nitrate
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there are many forms of nitrogen,
including both organic and inorganic
[SPEAKER_00]: forms, plants can only use these two
forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants only take up inorganic nitrogen in
the form of NO3 nitrate or NH4 plus in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all other forms of nitrogen are
intermediate forms and cannot be directly
[SPEAKER_00]: utilized by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be important in the cycle,
but as far as what the plant can uptake,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are the only two forms that the
plant can uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which one is better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in short, neither.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just remember that nitrate is always
present in the soil solution and will move
[SPEAKER_00]: with soil water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, keep that in mind that it's not
like, oh, I want to choose one versus
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both can be utilized by the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at this conversion forms of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inhibiting the conversion of our ammonia
to nitrate can result in less nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: loss and more plant uptake, because the
whole goal through this entire process is
[SPEAKER_00]: this important part here of plant uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here the nitrate form and the
ammonium form can both be uptaken by the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the only forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal here is to limit the chance of
this being converted or leached or this
[SPEAKER_00]: being immobilized or this being leached
out of the soil or part of the soil runoff
[SPEAKER_00]: or volatilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure we're having the
greatest percentage that we can going
[SPEAKER_00]: through plant uptakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not losing a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not wasting a lot of that
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we reduce the waste of nitrogen
fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, growers can work on ideally the
timing of that fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If plants are fertilized too early,
the risk for lost nitrogen does increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers should try and time the
application with plant uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here we have a corn plant as just an
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we fertilize very early, we're going to
lose a lot because the roots are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be small and also the demand for nitrogen
is reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at the corn,
again, as another example, 37% of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: taken up by post-flowering, 60% nitrogen
taken up by flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at fertilizing,
we want to time that for a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: later in the growth cycle when the demand
goes up, because what that's going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: is allow our nitrogen in the soil to be
uptaken by the plant at a greater
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency, simply because the plant is
demanding greater amounts of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as promised, what are some common
nitrogen fertilizer recommendations?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would I in general recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: And just some common fertilizers,
calcium nitrate is great to use when soils
[SPEAKER_00]: are colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: For more plant available form,
but it's only 15% nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to take that into consideration
that calcium nitrate is very plant
[SPEAKER_00]: available, but only 15% nitrogen compared
to some of the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urea is great when the soils are warmer,
but be sure to water it in to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: potential volatilization, and this is 48%
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I make that distinction because if
you're adding a pound of calcium nitrate
[SPEAKER_00]: and a pound of urea, and things are,
oh, they're both nitrogen fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: that pound of calcium is 15% in and that
pound of urea is 48% in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can scale this up to 100 pounds of
calcium nitrate of that 100 pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer, only 15 of that would be
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comparing that to urea, 100 pounds of
urea, 48%, almost half of that is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that there is no best form
of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to better understand this,
taking a June nitrate test.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other videos on that here on this
channel that you're welcome to take a look
[SPEAKER_00]: at to try to better understand nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you typically need to add it every
year, and it does change quite frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to best understand the
conditions and the process and cycle of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen will help you make a better
grower and help improve your plant performance.
