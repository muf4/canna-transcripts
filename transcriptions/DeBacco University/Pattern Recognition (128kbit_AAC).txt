[SPEAKER_00]: Here we'll look at pattern recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I have a bunch of shapes here,
can you recognize them as any particular
[SPEAKER_00]: objects if I kind of move that shape over?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it looks like I have a mug and a
suitcase here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example of pattern recognition is
if you're looking at a bunch of patch of
[SPEAKER_00]: clover, can you pick out the four-leaf
clover?
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's one there, can you recognize
that pattern and how it differs from
[SPEAKER_00]: what's around it despite the similarities?
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting more deep details of pattern
recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it can be an object or an event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So object examples would be eye color,
handwriting, fingerprints.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all can get into certain
patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also gestures or routines can be a
pattern that we may be able to see or
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize with certain people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patterns in everyday life, how do they
relate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, loan and credit card applications,
income dependence to determine whether
[SPEAKER_00]: someone is worthy of getting that credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they behaving over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dating services use age, hobbies,
height to determine desirability.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that line page is when we keyword
search descriptions to find documents,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's looking for a pattern in a
particular document or text block.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pattern recognition applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, pattern recognition is used to give
human identification intelligence to
[SPEAKER_00]: machines, which required for image
processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used to extract features from given
video or image samples that can also use
[SPEAKER_00]: as a computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where artificial intelligence can
come in and pick out the faces and be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to analyze those faces and compare them to
a data bank, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an example of pattern recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also similar objects, classifying them
into different classes or subgroups.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we have the large population
looking at males versus females.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one way of classifying people in
this image.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could be looking at a whole multitude
of ways of recognizing similarity of
[SPEAKER_00]: objects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Methods of pattern classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can separate data belong to
different classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When new data comes in, we need to
classify into a category so if we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at red versus blue fruits versus
the black, if we have another strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: come in, that's going to be red.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have an apple come in, if that's a
red apple, we're going to classify that
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a method of putting that in a
separate case or class.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's intra and interclass variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intra class, different typefaces of the
letter T.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go down and look at the different T,
that'd be intra, interclass variability,
[SPEAKER_00]: that'd be letters and numbers that look
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the letter B and the number
eight, it's an interclass variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus here, they're all the letter T,
but they have different typefaces,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they're intra class variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some of the challenges we have
when we're looking at how do we class
[SPEAKER_00]: certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Classification versus clustering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, classification is recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our clustering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our classification of low-risk
consumers and high-risk consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can cluster them as these groups here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just helps us to determine when we get
new data, where would that most likely fit
[SPEAKER_00]: or what can we gain from that new data
that comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: License plate recognition is one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where an automatic number plate
recognition can be used to store the
[SPEAKER_00]: images captured by cameras as well as a
text from the license plate with some
[SPEAKER_00]: configurability to store this photograph
of the driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that connection between that
license plate and that car, that time,
[SPEAKER_00]: and potentially even going to that driver
can be important for crime scene
[SPEAKER_00]: investigation or looking at tracing where
someone went.
[SPEAKER_00]: License plate recognition is very
important for pattern recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have fingerprint classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have five categories, arches,
tinted arches, ulnar loops, radio loops,
[SPEAKER_00]: whirls.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these can be a way of identifying
certain patterns and classifying them and
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing them to a known set or database.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have face detection.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a computer that identifies human
faces in digital images.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also be used with face detection
software within cameras, potentially for
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be automatic as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical applications, this can be
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where skin cancer detection, what's the
normal, what's not?
[SPEAKER_00]: What fits into what pattern?
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to recognize something that
looks different is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all evidence of potential skin
cancers just based on the image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depicted in all these different sizes,
different than a freckle, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a mole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conveyor belts, they also have pattern
recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are typically computer based,
but they can also be human based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas optical sorters can recognize
object's color, size, its shape,
[SPEAKER_00]: structural or chemical composition,
can allocate it to different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be achieved in a non-destructive
100% inspection in line at full production
[SPEAKER_00]: volumes, allowing us to ensure we're
having consistent product coming out or
[SPEAKER_00]: we're allocating out into different areas,
different sizes or different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of this can be done with automation
and optical eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important that those computers can
recognize patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: From patterns, we can have feature
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's assume a fisherman told us that a
sea bass is generally larger, I shouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: say longer than a salmon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a sea bass, here's a salmon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use length as a feature and decide
between sea bass and salmon according to
[SPEAKER_00]: the threshold on length.
[SPEAKER_00]: How should we choose the threshold?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to accumulate some data at least
initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our length histogram looking at
different parts of the fish here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though the sea bass is longer than
salmon on the average, there are many
[SPEAKER_00]: examples in this case where the fish does
not hold true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our salmon, here's our sea bass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that there's definitely some
indications where there are some longer
[SPEAKER_00]: salmon than sea bass and some longer sea
bass than salmon in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We develop that threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's that breaking point that we can
say most of the time it's true for one or
[SPEAKER_00]: the other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Average lightness of the histogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: While looking here, it seems easier to
choose the threshold at X, but we still
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot make this perfect decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're seeing this is most likely
where the salmon are going to be different
[SPEAKER_00]: than the sea bass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that average lightness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at different colorations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see it doesn't always hold true.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see there's definitely an area here
where most of the time that does hold
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multi-featured.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can improve recognition accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of just using one of those
features, we can have multiple features.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might be able to use more than one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Single features may not yield the best
performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using a combination of these features may
yield better performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like a Swiss army knife.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a bunch of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's multi-featured.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used in a variety of situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using our past example, we can use the
lightness of the coloration as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: width of the length of those fish in
physical size.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many features do we include?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this gets interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does adding more features always improve
its performance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, more is not always better.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be redundancy or
over-complication to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the little far-side Gary Larson
cartoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting too much blood in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a certain point that there's that
ideal amount, but then if you go over and
[SPEAKER_00]: above, you can actually cause a negative
feature to occur or get less useful data
[SPEAKER_00]: from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We classify things.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we classify things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Partition the feature space into two
regions by finding the decision boundary
[SPEAKER_00]: that minimizes error.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice that this says minimize error.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't necessarily eliminate error.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should find the optimal decision
boundary.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we go about finding this boundary
of our classification?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a complexity model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect classification performance and
training data is possible by choosing a
[SPEAKER_00]: more complex model.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this can lead to over-fitting the
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of our simple line, technically,
there's some of those pink dots over here
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of the black dots here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we overfit that model and get too
complex, well, we'd create this little
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy line here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not probably the best case, not really
useful data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want where it's mostly true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't always have to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is over-fitting the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to mostly be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times that we perform that
generalization, we produce that simpler
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generalization is defined by the ability
to classify or produce the correct results
[SPEAKER_00]: on novel patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we improve the generalization of
the performance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, more training examples, better model
estimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The simpler models usually yield better
performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, while the complex model may be
accurate just about all the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: the simpler model makes a lot more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's accurate most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at generalizing for a
pattern, it may not work 100% of the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in this case, it's very easy to see
with new data that may come in where we
[SPEAKER_00]: would classify that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just gave you a random data point and
said, is that most likely a salmon or a
[SPEAKER_00]: sea bass?
[SPEAKER_00]: The point ended in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say it's more likely to be a sea bass.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was in this region, more likely to
be a salmon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this simpler delineation model
makes it a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here with this complex model, we get lost
and glean less information in total.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generalization, be careful with how
general you make certain statements,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in many cases, they can yield a more
simpler model that can potentially have
[SPEAKER_00]: better results when trying to classify new
data.
