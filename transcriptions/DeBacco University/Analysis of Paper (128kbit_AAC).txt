[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at the analysis of
paper and some of the properties of paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically how it can help us with
forensic science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, there's types of paper and
there's many types of paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might be thinking of the paper
you're taking notes on, but there's inkjet
[SPEAKER_00]: paper, there's bond paper, there's wax
paper, there's filter paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just shows you some of the
variability or the extreme variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even within, for example, inkjet
paper, there is some variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these paper additives, so paper has
things added to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seizing makes the surface of the paper
less porous to ink, and this allows
[SPEAKER_00]: handwriting and printing to look sharp and
clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be something for looking at a
note.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might notice something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's fillers added that add color,
surface texture, and durability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's coatings.
[SPEAKER_00]: These coatings help improve the look and
surface properties of the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coatings makes paper more suitable for
copiers, printers, or even normal
[SPEAKER_00]: handwriting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The image that we see here, we can see
those layers may not be consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some could be of various thicknesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can also play an important role in
identifying the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been talking about paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what is it in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, pretty much it's made of wooden
cotton, and at least those are the most
[SPEAKER_00]: common ingredients that make up today's
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the amount or the type can be a
little bit variable, but those are the
[SPEAKER_00]: general components.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also common additives to paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are chemicals that affect the
color, the occupancy, the strength and
[SPEAKER_00]: durability and brightness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are part of the paper-producing
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things to consider with paper,
looking at typically the thickness is the
[SPEAKER_00]: first thing that you may notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thickness is measured sometimes in GSM,
or grams per square meter, or a caliper,
[SPEAKER_00]: referring to the thickness in thousandths
of an inch, and you use calipers to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, greeting cards being
very thick and heavy, and tissue paper
[SPEAKER_00]: being on the other end of the spectrum
here being a lot thinner, and this for a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot lighter in grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: The texture of the paper plays a big role
when it's printed and how it looks when
[SPEAKER_00]: completed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be coated in uncoated textures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The coated allows inks to kind of dry on
the surface, where uncoated, those
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed fibers get into the paper,
into the fibers that we can see here in a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more of a detailed view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often this means the inks will appear more
vibrant and intense and coated stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just something to consider when
you're looking at the paper, or if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at handwriting or ink used on that
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also have the brightness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the brightness, you could think of this
as like the wattage of a light bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brightness is the volume of light
reflected off the sheet of paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 0 to 100 scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a measurement of reflectance of the
blue, which is shorter wavelengths of the
[SPEAKER_00]: visual spectrum at 450 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that translate to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's a paper of 100 brightness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one of 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the 90 is duller in appearance
than the 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also finishes that might be put
onto paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are other things to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the uncoated, the matte,
the glossy, and the UV gloss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The paper's finish is referring to like
the sheen or how shiny the paper is when
[SPEAKER_00]: it plays a role in the readability and the
look of what's printed on the page.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference between uncoated matte and
gloss is primarily the amount of coating
[SPEAKER_00]: that is applied to the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see here these different types
shot under the same light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see clearly it being reflected at
the greatest intensity with the UV gloss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty much non-existent on the
uncoated and barely visible at all on the
[SPEAKER_00]: matte.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just shows the kind of example of the
coating on how that can impact the
[SPEAKER_00]: shininess to that paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have shades of white.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the paper was written on white paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there is a bunch of different types
of white paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been to a paint store,
you know the plethora of amount of options
[SPEAKER_00]: you have under simply the color white.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's variations that include soft,
off-white, there's silk white,
[SPEAKER_00]: soft asparagus here, antique white.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a large variability here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are often considered part of the
natural color scheme and are very common
[SPEAKER_00]: types used for paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to consider the occupancy of
the paper that you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: A high occupancy and low occupancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: High occupancy is going to block a lot,
and low occupancy you're going to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to see through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's referring to the degree of
obstruction of light that's expressed as a
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, something as 98% occupancy
means that 98% of the light cannot pass
[SPEAKER_00]: through the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low occupancy means the paper will have
more show through.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be like a simple little light
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look it up under the light and see how
easy it is to see through.
[SPEAKER_00]: High occupancy is going to be like
business or card stock that's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: really thick and dense paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And low occupancy, as you would hope it
would have, would be like tracing paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: something very thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last thing you want to consider in certain
papers is the potential for a watermark,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a unique image in paper that
appears at various shades of lightness and
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness when viewed with transmitted
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watermarks can be used on postage stamps,
currency, and other documents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very common to find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times money is used to kind of
help prevent counterfeiting, but there are
[SPEAKER_00]: some companies that do put a watermark
within their papers, sometimes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: corners, sometimes in the entire
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be difficult to see, but if it is
present, if you look under the right
[SPEAKER_00]: light, you'll be able to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these factors can help you
identify paper and match it up to
[SPEAKER_00]: something that might be found on a crime
scene versus a stock paper source.
