[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at the
digestive process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in general the process of breaking
down the food that we consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting first with the breakdown of
carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, it's the starch converted into
sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: A polysaccharide being broken down by
satellite amylase, no surprise in your
[SPEAKER_00]: saliva, breaking down our starch,
our complex polysaccharide, into some
[SPEAKER_00]: disaccharides that then ultimately can be
broken down into monosaccharides.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, disaccharide sucrose,
sucrase enzyme, will break that down into
[SPEAKER_00]: one monomer of glucose and one monomer of
fructose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maltose, maltase enzyme, will break that
into two monomers of glucose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amylase is this enzyme that breaks down
carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cannot break down fats or proteins or
anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, enzymes are very specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on with protein digestion,
and this occurs in the stomach and the
[SPEAKER_00]: duodenum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three main enzymes are secreted,
pepsin by the stomach, tripsin and
[SPEAKER_00]: chymotrypsin by the pancreas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pancreas is involved with a lot of
enzymes, secreting them into the
[SPEAKER_00]: intestines for the digestion process to
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The end result is to break down these
proteins into amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our protein, here's our pepsin,
breaking down into large polypeptides,
[SPEAKER_00]: short polypeptides, and ultimately down
into amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see some of the general
digestive processes that are occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protein digestion enzymes are secreted in
the brush border here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, our pancreas is secreting protein
digesting enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some also occurring in the stomach by the
simple hydrochloric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The small intestine is the major site of
protein digestion, and the final digestion
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs here in the small intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really a lot of digestion occurs
necessarily in the large intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the small intestine being the
major site of our protein digestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the liver regulates distributed
amino acids to the rest of the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very important organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, the general process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gives you a good pictorial here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, color codes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the blue squiggling lines are
propulsion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the swallowing and the pushing of
our food through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have our chemical digestion,
which is these little green raindrops,
[SPEAKER_00]: and mechanical digestion, which is the
chewing that occurs in the mouth,
[SPEAKER_00]: or churning of the actual in the stomach,
and also churning that occurs in the small
[SPEAKER_00]: intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this side in the orange, you see the
absorption of nutrients, water,
[SPEAKER_00]: blood vessels, the vessels are all
absorbing these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, water in the large intestine is
being absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general overview, we see the cat
eating the food here, is we're ingesting
[SPEAKER_00]: our food, we're digesting, breaking it
down, then we're absorbing our food.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're simply going to be able to use to
make cells in various structures that our
[SPEAKER_00]: body needs, and ultimately, we're removing
unused food in the amount of feces.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general structure of digestive organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not going to spend a lot of time on this,
but we have the mucosa, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: epithelium here, that inner area,
submucosa, which is the connective tissue,
[SPEAKER_00]: muscularis, which is smooth muscle to keep
things moving, and serosa, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: connective tissue, holding everything in
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general path that food travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put into six easy steps, even though
there's eight listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mouth, the esophagus, the stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I break apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of tie this in with the liver and
the pancreas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, in this image, it's broken apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our small intestine, our large
intestine, and ultimately, solid waste
[SPEAKER_00]: passes through the anus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, this pathway that food
travels, it's important to know what
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs where, and also what order that it
occurs, because that's important to allow
[SPEAKER_00]: the most efficient use of the food we take
in to convert it to energy, to be used for
[SPEAKER_00]: our body, to allow us to continue on
living a normal and healthy life.
