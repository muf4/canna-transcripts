[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to go over the brief
overview of the five themes that unify
[SPEAKER_00]: biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make it a whole encompassing
unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first one is evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene frequencies change in a species over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terms we're going to work with when we get
into the topic of evolution will be
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic drift, natural and artificial
selection, and founder effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's just a quick overview here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before selection, we have all these
circles that are different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for color blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice here after selection,
the red and the dark red were favored for
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular environment or stress that
occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our final population, for those that
can see color, are composed of red and
[SPEAKER_00]: dark red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the yellows and tans and oranges were
selected again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also here have a migrating population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a couple generations that
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through founder effects, we see the purple
ones here were the most advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the five themes that unify
biology is evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second theme is the flow of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All living organisms require energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun is the source of energy for most
ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for some organisms that live way
down in the deep ocean, vast majority
[SPEAKER_00]: though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, the sun is the main source of
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants capture energy via photosynthesis,
and they can act as an energy source for
[SPEAKER_00]: other organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here the sun's energy at the very
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's producing, for our primary
producer, that's their main source of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the primary consumers, and then
secondary consumers, third level
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers, apex predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of energy is being lost to heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we can't create or destroy energy,
but a lot is being lost to heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then these are being broken down by
decomposers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those nutrients are being recycled,
and the kind of circle goes around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice 100% down to 10%, this is how
much we're losing to heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why there's so few apex predators
and so many primary producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third theme that unifies biology is
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interaction between organisms is critical
for evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's social behavior that occurs when
organisms of the same species live in
[SPEAKER_00]: direct contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see here with the meerkats,
these are highly social animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have community dynamics that
occurs when organisms of different species
[SPEAKER_00]: live in direct contact with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could be an example here of the
butterfly and the flower, two very
[SPEAKER_00]: different species, but interacting in a
community-like way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fourth theme that unifies biology is
structure determines function.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be very important to go over
macromolecules, specifically proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: But biological structures are well-suited
to their function.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very true at every level of
organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: The example I give here is the sequence of
amino acids leads to a specific structure
[SPEAKER_00]: that can lead to a very specific function.
[SPEAKER_00]: The example here would be enzymes that
have a very specialized active site that
[SPEAKER_00]: only bind to one piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their structure determines their
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the last thing that unifies
biology is homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All living organisms act to maintain a
relatively stable internal environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maintaining homeostasis requires
energy and a lot of signaling back and
[SPEAKER_00]: forth between cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have positive feedback and
negative feedback systems here as a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: lower things or raise things to maintain
these relatively stable internal
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to quickly review all five,
you can see them listed right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've provided them an individual size and
broke them down with images that hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: make it more memorable so you're able to
make connections with the five themes that
[SPEAKER_00]: unify biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
