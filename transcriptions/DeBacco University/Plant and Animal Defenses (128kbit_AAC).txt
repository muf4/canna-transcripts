[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to go over plant and animal
[SPEAKER_00]: defenses that will involve physical means,
chemical means, as well for animals,
[SPEAKER_00]: forms of mimicry.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into some of the
plant and animal defenses here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the plant defenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, plants have evolved many mechanisms
to defend themselves from herbivores,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of a feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have developed morphological or with
structural defenses such as thorns,
[SPEAKER_00]: spines, and prickles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, all of these are just
deterrents from an animal coming in or
[SPEAKER_00]: something coming in and feeding on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here with the structural defenses
of the sharpness to the leaves here of the
[SPEAKER_00]: American holly, evolutionary modified
stems or thorns on the honey locust,
[SPEAKER_00]: and here we see leaves modified into
spines in the form of this barrel cactus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, plants have also evolved chemical
defenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are secondary chemical compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be found in most algae as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mustard oil, so we can see in this image
here, is one common one, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: found, of course, in the mustard family,
the Brassica casea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these plant defenses, these mustard
oils themselves, protect plants from
[SPEAKER_00]: herbivores at least at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, some have been able, some insects
have evolved to be able to break down the
[SPEAKER_00]: mustard oil, and these insects were able
to use this new resource without competing
[SPEAKER_00]: with other herbivores for it, and this is
a great example of the cabbage butterfly
[SPEAKER_00]: caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they do is they basically consume the
mustard plant, and they don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: worry about any other competition because
other insects haven't evolved that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: way to kind of combat that mustard oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for animal defenses, some animals
receive an additional benefit from eating
[SPEAKER_00]: plants rich in secondary chemical
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, the caterpillars of the
butterfly, the monarch butterfly in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular, concentrate and store these
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They then pass them on to the adult and
even the potential eggs of the next
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Birds that eat the butterflies regurgitate
them because of their bad taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example of an insect able to
kind of take in those compounds and carry
[SPEAKER_00]: them over and have a benefit to be reduced
predation on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we also have other animal defenses
such as cryptic coloration, where a color
[SPEAKER_00]: that blends into the surrounding,
we have the interim caterpillar,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see it with the owls, the different
frog colors, the flounder on the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: here, whether it's a fine kind of sand or
whether it's a larger coarse gravelly base
[SPEAKER_00]: can kind of easily blend into that,
and of course, that's going to help reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the odds of predators finding them,
consuming them, and reducing their total
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have other animal defenses,
and one that kind of goes completely
[SPEAKER_00]: against the blending in is the having a
showy color, the asymptomatic coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is advertising a poisonous nature as
we see here with these frogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are very poisonous frogs,
and they kind of instead of blending in,
[SPEAKER_00]: they go the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to be loud and proud and kind of
show off and say, I'm poisonous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can easily see me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay away from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also other chemical defenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So alkaloids are known as having a varying
degree of impacts on humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low doses can have beneficial effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: High doses can be toxic or even cause
death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alkaloids can be found in the stings of
bees or wasps, which of course can be
[SPEAKER_00]: deadly to some people, but in low doses
may have potential for some medical
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits in others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have those toxic alkaloids as
we see here, of course, with our very
[SPEAKER_00]: brightly colored frogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with mimicry, it's a close external
resemblance of an animal or plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many non-poisonous species have evolved to
resemble poisonous ones with asymptomatic
[SPEAKER_00]: coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basian mimicry here is a harmless
unprotected species mimics or resembles
[SPEAKER_00]: the poisonous model that exhibits the
asymptomatic coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the mimics are relatively scarce,
it will be avoided by predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: This concept is kind of like the sheep's
inward wolf clothing, and this mimic must
[SPEAKER_00]: be present in low numbers for this to be
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the other form of mimicry is called
malaria mimicry, and this is where two or
[SPEAKER_00]: more unrelated but protected species come
to resemble one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a group defense is achieved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the viceroy butterfly,
which is an edible butterfly, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: monarch butterfly, which is very
distasteful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at them, here we see the
monarch on the left and the viceroy on the
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are examples of two species,
two butterflies resembling malaria
[SPEAKER_00]: mimicry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now just a quick comparison between
these two forms of mimicry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the basian mimicry, which is a
deadly and a non-deadly species,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this has deadly consequences for the
predator if they make the wrong selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that malaria mimicry we
just saw, both can be eaten, but one does
[SPEAKER_00]: not taste as good as the other and is a
lookalike and therefore is also assumed
[SPEAKER_00]: not to taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the key part with malaria mimicry is
neither are poisonous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simply an unpleasant experience for
the predator.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see that example here is very
rare, it's something really bitter or
[SPEAKER_00]: really sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of an example here of just an
unpleasant experience, would be malaria
[SPEAKER_00]: mimicry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basian mimicry is going to have that
deadly consequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly we have self mimicry,
which is adaptations where one animal body
[SPEAKER_00]: part comes to resemble another.
[SPEAKER_00]: This type of mimicry is used by both
predator and prey.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example here we see eye spots found in
many butterflies, moths, fish,
[SPEAKER_00]: and other animals as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fish, for example, the eye spots,
the predator typically will aim for the
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case with the eye being located
towards the back, the predator will
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally go behind the eye and aim for
this area, which of course will just be
[SPEAKER_00]: water, and that will allow the fish here
to escape from that degree of predation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this hopefully gives you a little bit
of background here of some plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: animal defenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
