[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we look at the limiting factors
in photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've looked at biological systems and
there's always some sort of limiting
[SPEAKER_00]: factor that's involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at that as more of a
micro scale here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, we'll look at light
intensity, carbon dioxide concentration,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also temperature and how this impacts
the rate of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with limiting factor in the
general sense, a limiting factor,
[SPEAKER_00]: these can be resources in environmental
conditions that restrict growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: abundance, or distribution of an organism
or a population of organisms in an
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about predators before,
physical barriers, particular biomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: speed limits, all of these impact our
limiting factors to an individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now going to take this and look at
more of a micro scale here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, light energy is necessary for
photosynthesis and as it applies in the
[SPEAKER_00]: name photo meaning light, but the
intensity of light can vary due to
[SPEAKER_00]: weather, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a cloudy day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a sunny day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a foggy morning?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that impacting the light intensity?
[SPEAKER_00]: The location of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it in a large open field?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it near some rocks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it under large trees, different areas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it on the north side of a building,
the south side?
[SPEAKER_00]: This could impact the intensity of light
that that plant may receive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also this season, spring, summer,
winter, or fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can impact the light intensity based on
the angle of the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relative season of nearby plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this means is if you're a plant
living under a deciduous tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: they drop their leaves in the fall,
meaning in the winter, in early spring,
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant will reserve a greater
intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at our light intensity to a
photosynthetic rate graph, we'll notice as
[SPEAKER_00]: light intensity increases from A to B,
the rate of photosynthesis will also
[SPEAKER_00]: increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is not continuous and
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we reach here our maximum rate,
even if the light becomes brighter,
[SPEAKER_00]: from B to C the light is brighter,
the rate of photosynthesis will remain the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We reach that plateau or that maximum
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now light intensity follows this
particular inverse square law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is, the inverse square law
is a specified intensity is inversely
[SPEAKER_00]: proportional to the square of the distance
from the source.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a little easier terms here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy twice as far from the source is
spread out over four times the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll notice here with our light,
and as we get further away, it's like an
[SPEAKER_00]: exponential decrease in the intensity of
the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that here with our candle,
and our book, and our clock, and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: as we get further away, the intensity of
that light drops off significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that here, the little
mathematics here of the inverse square of
[SPEAKER_00]: the sphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our area and it's being spread
out over that four times the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the distance becomes twice as far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is part of the reason why light
decreases so quickly, because it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: inverse square law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now light's measured in something called
PAR, P-A-R, Photosynthetically Active
[SPEAKER_00]: Radiation, and it's designated for the
spectral range or wave band of solar
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation from 400 to 700 nanometers that
photosynthetic organisms are able to use
[SPEAKER_00]: and process of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this 400 to 700 nanometers is
referring to specific wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 400 we can see here versus the 700 and
800, and we notice on our graph over here
[SPEAKER_00]: that the wavelengths are not all used by
the same pigments in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: See our chlorophyll B, chlorophyll A,
carotenoids are all using different
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is helping the plant be able to use a
greater portion of this spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this image shows here is we have our
light intensity at the center point,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as we get further away from that light
intensity, we notice how quick the PAR may
[SPEAKER_00]: drop off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see it being very limited or
very low intensity to the perimeters,
[SPEAKER_00]: a very high intensity in the center point
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important if we're considering
lighting a plant, we want to have that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant directly under that light,
because the further we keep that light
[SPEAKER_00]: away, the less intensity of light that it
will receive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon dioxide concentration is another
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can help limit or potentially limit
plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So carbon dioxide is a common limiting
factor, assuming all other factors,
[SPEAKER_00]: example water and lighting, are not
limiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these limiting factors assume that
they're the most limiting amongst all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that the atmospheric
percentage of carbon dioxide is only about
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.04%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more carbon dioxide a plant is given,
the faster it can synthesize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this only occurs up to a certain rate,
as we see here again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increasing the carbon dioxide
concentration, these brackets in
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration, will not increase the rate
of photosynthesis beyond that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our normal atmospheric air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some water vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are oxygen, lots of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're increasing our carbon dioxide
concentration from A to B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthetic rate is also increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we get to C, we're in that
plateau phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increasing carbon dioxide here at this
point is not yielding any greater
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How this may look, elevating carbon
dioxide concentrations can increase plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, assuming sunlight and nutrients
are not limiting factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind the average atmospheric
carbon dioxide expressed in parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million is approximately 410.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our ambient here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These images show growth with additional
carbon dioxide expressed in parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ambient should be about 410.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're increasing it by an additional 150.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be about 560 parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice the plant's growing a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're increasing 300 parts per million
from ambient, better growth, and 450
[SPEAKER_00]: parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're almost doubling the amount of carbon
dioxide present in the natural atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we notice the growth difference that
does occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's 196.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about half of the normal carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's 752, a study done.
[SPEAKER_00]: On average, growth response to 300 parts
per million of additional carbon dioxide,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can look at some of the data provided
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty much it all comes through an
increase in some average of anywhere from
[SPEAKER_00]: an average of 32.8% to as high as 70% for
trees, increasing the ambient carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one way, assuming, again,
water, nutrients, and lights are not
[SPEAKER_00]: limiting factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: To help increase yields of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature is the last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemical reactions of photosynthesis are
impacted by temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rate and temperature are directly
proportional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning as temperature increases,
so does the photosynthetic rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, since this is a biological
system, there's an optimum temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much for most plants, any
temperature above 86 degrees Fahrenheit is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the maximum rate of
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything above or below that is going to
be below maximum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we get too high, we notice that our
rate does drop off significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proteins are starting to denature,
and there's other issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Below 86, there's just not enough energy
to move those molecules fast enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: 86 is considered the optimum temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything above that, again, we see a
dramatic decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And below that, we're noticing an increase
up to that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the general summary here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to put it in graphical form,
how does light, carbon dioxide,
[SPEAKER_00]: and temperature impact the rate of
photosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see how light impacts it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And carbon dioxide have very similar
graphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And temperature has that optimum,
again, around 86 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And photosynthetic rate will be lower at
temperatures greater than 86 or less than
[SPEAKER_00]: 86 degrees Fahrenheit.
