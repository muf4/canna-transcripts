[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're looking at population
growth models that can be applied to the
[SPEAKER_00]: world's population, estimating different
growth scenarios as being low,
[SPEAKER_00]: medium, or high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we can, in this case, mushrooms,
or plants, or just about anything that has
[SPEAKER_00]: a population we can apply growth models
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to start here by applying
it to an example of yellow perch,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a freshwater fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, how many more deaths
occurred in 2001 than births based on this
[SPEAKER_00]: data compared to the year 2000?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the equation we're going to
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: This delta, or change in N, or change in
population size over the change in time
[SPEAKER_00]: equals the birth rate minus the death
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to use this data right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quality of analysis is locate both time
intervals, year 2000 and 2001.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the year 2000, the population of perch
was 16,000, and the population declined to
[SPEAKER_00]: 12,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the year 2001, therefore, 4,000 more
deaths occurred than births.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that it's not as simple as 4,000
perch died.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that births didn't cease.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the difference between
our birth rate and our death rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the quantitative analysis,
plugging it into the equation here,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have that 4,000 more deaths than births
occurred from the year 2000 to 2001.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while births still occurred,
there were still yellow perch being born,
[SPEAKER_00]: the difference between those that died and
those that were born was 4,000 more deaths
[SPEAKER_00]: that occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's different types of curves I
want you just to be in general familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an exponential one, where it's
just continuing to increase at a very
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not linear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exponential.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a logistic curve here, where we see a
rapid increase and then a level and offer
[SPEAKER_00]: a plateau that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking here at exponential growth curves,
this is the growth rate of E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we apply the same kind of idea,
the change in population size over time
[SPEAKER_00]: equals the maximum per capita growth and
per rate of the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most common examples of
exponential growth here is bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they can multiply at a very fast
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each bacteria can split into two cells and
double in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may only take 18 to 22 minutes for
this to occur, depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if we only start with one
bacteria, which doubles every hour since
[SPEAKER_00]: it reproduces asexually, by the end of the
day, just looking at a day count,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'd start with one bacteria doubling,
in this case, every hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the end of the day, we would have over
16 million bacteria if it followed this
[SPEAKER_00]: exponential growth curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: As exponential growth assumes the
population is growing without limits at
[SPEAKER_00]: its maximum rate, kind of see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are environmental limits,
no matter what system we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we do have an exponential phase
here, theoretically, that would continue
[SPEAKER_00]: on forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this doesn't happen because of
environmental limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's plateauing, and we can even have the
reverse occur, where we have a death phase
[SPEAKER_00]: that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The logistics growth model here is,
no matter how fast populations grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: they eventually reach a limit,
and that's kind of evident here,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it starts plateauing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is imposed by shortage of important
environmental factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be nutrients, it could be water,
it could be space, it could be light,
[SPEAKER_00]: any combination of these, depending on
what organisms in what geographic region
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's something called carrying
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the carrying capacity is the maximum
number of individuals that an area can
[SPEAKER_00]: support, and it's symbolized by the letter
K.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have time and population size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early growth is rapid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost exponential here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growth begins to slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's kind of a point here, and later
growth falls to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean that there's zero
individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growth rate will fall to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growth rate reaches that carrying
capacity, that kind of maximum number of
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals that a particular region can
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So A is showing the exponential curve,
which really does not occur in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this more logistic curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have exponential for a short period of
time, and a leveling off as those
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms approach it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is what we call, or termed,
their carrying capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the population approaches its carrying
capacity, the growth rate slows because of
[SPEAKER_00]: limited factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The logistic growth equation accounts for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The graphical plot of N, which is number
of individuals versus T, time,
[SPEAKER_00]: gives an S-shaped signal growth curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that here, we're starting with
individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an exponential phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a stationary phase where things
level off.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example, we also have a death
phase that falls back down over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Showing a nice image of comparing the two
of exponential versus logistic growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exponential assumes unlimited resources,
where populations exhibit exponential
[SPEAKER_00]: growth really in this J-shaped curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: More realistically, we have this logistic
growth model, which has a carrying
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Populations exhibit logistic growth,
where expansion decreases as resources
[SPEAKER_00]: become more scarce, and levels off when
the carrying capacity of environment is
[SPEAKER_00]: reached, resulting in this S-shaped curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one that's more true for
biological systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're using this model here for
what's the carrying capacity of this
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see, this only takes hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes very quickly, the amount of yeast,
that carrying capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should be able to look at a graph
and determine the carrying capacity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also the time it takes to reach K for
that carrying capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at our yeast specifically,
it takes about, what's the carrying
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 13 individuals, we could say,
for this given environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes approximately 30 hours for this
to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, this one's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at one that's a little bit more
complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pair of ECM here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the carrying capacity, and how long
does it take to reach that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some populations fluctuate greatly
to make it difficult to define that
[SPEAKER_00]: carrying capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some overshoot and then undershoot,
so we're kind of looking at where does
[SPEAKER_00]: that leveling off occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take a look, what's the carrying
capacity of this population, and how long
[SPEAKER_00]: does it take it to reach that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the simple answer is, the carrying
capacity is about 130, as you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes approximately about 100 days for
it to kind of level off and reach that
[SPEAKER_00]: determination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this is helpful and allowing
you to understand population growth
[SPEAKER_00]: models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for watching, and we'll see
you next time.
