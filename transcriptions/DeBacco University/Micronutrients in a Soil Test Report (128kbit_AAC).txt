[SPEAKER_00]: So in this tobacco university video,
we're gonna look at some micronutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: which keep in mind while needed in small
amounts are still needed by plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's wise to try to go through and try
to understand them better based on a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: test report.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at micronutrients in
a soil test report.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see just a couple of them
listed here in the image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look micronutrients are
essential, but so micronutrients are
[SPEAKER_00]: elements that are essential for plants,
but they are required by plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely small micro amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're keeping in mind these
micronutrients, we see a couple here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a little triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are these kind of micronutrients,
boron, copper, iron, manganese,
[SPEAKER_00]: molybdenum, nickel, zinc, chlorine,
all considered to be micronutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: needed, essential by a plant, but needed
in very small micro amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at micronutrients
related to plants, their availability
[SPEAKER_00]: often correlates well with soil pH as well
as organic matter levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if these two factors are in the
desirable range for the crop being grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrient deficiencies or excess
seldom occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So test reports indicate the amount of
several extractable micronutrients in
[SPEAKER_00]: parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, again, where you see that pH
being a very important driving factor,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly for your micronutrients
because they're needed in small amounts,
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure your pH is dialed in can
really help forego the potential for a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of issues with micronutrient deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, typical soil test does include
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see one here provides boron,
copper, iron, manganese, and zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the levels of micronutrients that
typically appear in a soil test,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can see them listed right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they give the kind of optimum range
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a little different for the
micronutrients compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as stated here on the micronutrients,
you see this little asterisk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this soil test report, it says
micronutrient deficiencies rarely occur in
[SPEAKER_00]: New England soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, an optimum range has never been
defined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Values provided represent the normal range
in soils and are for reference only.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an important note.
[SPEAKER_00]: For your macronutrients, we have an idea
of an optimum range.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we see this very low,
low optimum above optimum range.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for micronutrients, we're just
providing with that general expected range
[SPEAKER_00]: for the region that the lab is from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, missing micronutrient
recommendations, yes, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only typical ranges which represent
typical soil background levels are
[SPEAKER_00]: provided for diagnostic purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are no exact recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recommendations are not made because
adjusting soil pH and or soil organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter levels usually corrects any
micronutrient problems that may exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you do have a crop that is
experiencing a specific micronutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency, you may be looking at adding a
certain amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind with your macronutrient
less can be more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't add them in large amounts and small
amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can work your way up from there in
the sense that you can always add,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can't necessarily take away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're fertilizing, as I said,
with our micronutrients, we kind of see
[SPEAKER_00]: them listed here, should only be done if
all other factors are maximized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only certain species may benefit from
levels above what is naturally in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So applying only use small amounts to
avoid potential toxicity levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to go toxic with micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuller applications may be better options
to ensure limited additions are made or to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at if you're trying to correct a
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add small amounts, spray some on the
leaves and see if that helps alleviate
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, they are needed by plants,
but they're needed in very small amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be a very different,
much smaller quantity to be added compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to those macronutrients you might be more
accustomed to adding to grow your plants.
