[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video,
where I'm going to go over a rotary and
[SPEAKER_00]: drop walk behind fertilizer spreader
comparison to determine which one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: two is the best fit for your given
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, when you're looking at these
options, here are some questions you
[SPEAKER_00]: should be asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the ground established or is it rough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has it been recently entilled and roughed
up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's going to be best for a rotary
spreader.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it more of a turf grass application,
more level?
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop spreader might be the favorite pick
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of fertilizer are you looking to
apply?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be pelletized?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be best for a rotary spreader,
because they throw it further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a powder, that would be better for a
drop spreader.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the questions just go a little bit
beyond this, and I want you to make an
[SPEAKER_00]: informed decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at a true rotary
spreader here, it throws fertilizer well
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond the width of the spreader.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can cover a large area very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's best for products that come in
pelletized form, because we're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of throw that on that distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows for that nice even distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at a drop spreader.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the name implies, the product basically
drops vertically.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an agitator that turns when the
wheels move to keep an even distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's best for small areas or when applying
fine or lightweight products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overlapping is recommended to ensure even
coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of go one way and kind of go
the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows to ensure you're getting a
consistent coverage over the entire area
[SPEAKER_00]: you intend to get that product applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at a rotary spreader.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, they throw the fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the question is, well, how far?
[SPEAKER_00]: Using a constant sized and weighted
pelletized product, you can go over some
[SPEAKER_00]: trays and collect the material after a few
passes, as we can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will let you know what the effective
swath is for your spreader.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you collect all the trays and it gives
you an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's always going to be a
little bit more closer to the center point
[SPEAKER_00]: where the spreader goes over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you an idea of that effective
swath.
[SPEAKER_00]: How far you actually covering and this
will determine your overlap area as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be a little bit of a pain to do
initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go over same area, collect some data
and really makes it much easier for you to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you're not wasting your time and
wasting product when you're going through
[SPEAKER_00]: and applying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For full calibration of spreaders in
general, Penn State Extension has a full
[SPEAKER_00]: set of instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a link here, direct link.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it comes down to is the amount of
product you apply over an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: For most homeowners, you can read the
suggestions on your spreader, calculate
[SPEAKER_00]: your observed swath and then in favor on
the low side and make a pass of known
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you know the amount of fertilizer
you added and you know the area covered,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can check to see how much area
was covered per pound of fertilizer and
[SPEAKER_00]: factor this up for your chosen area to
ensure you're applying the correct amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will help ensure you do not go over
applying fertilizer for a given area and
[SPEAKER_00]: help keep your costs low and your chance
for environmental contamination also low.
[SPEAKER_00]: After calibrating a drop spreader,
since the swath is known, since it depends
[SPEAKER_00]: on the width of your drop spreader,
the same concept for determining
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer applied to your areas or rotary
spreader can be followed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key again is to favor on the low side
as it's easier to make another pass or
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the drop rate and there's ways
you can dial in those spreaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that you should be making two
passes to ensure even and complete
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's great to kind of take some of
the confusion out of this is that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: times fertilizer bags will have a starting
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll look at your spreader model and
they'll look at the suggested settings to
[SPEAKER_00]: apply a set amount of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again this can act as a great kind of
way to start and then go through,
[SPEAKER_00]: do a little area and you can go through
and determine whether it's matching what
[SPEAKER_00]: you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again the key part here is also keep a you
know consistent walking pace because that
[SPEAKER_00]: will affect your amount of fertilizer
added as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some common fertilizer model
brands there and a lot of times fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: companies and spreaders try to match up
what they have there so you can at least
[SPEAKER_00]: provide a substitute there that may be
close to what you have to again create
[SPEAKER_00]: that's good starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that suggested pattern I suggest a
cross grid pattern reduces the chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: skipping over an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of go from here we'll say from
left to right and you get to the end and
[SPEAKER_00]: you kind of go up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of go like an east-west and
then a north-south kind of spreading
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern there and that helps ensure even
coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is an example of poor
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly with when you're applying
nitrogen-based fertilizers you can see an
[SPEAKER_00]: area that you might miss and here we can
definitely see the overlap was not nearly
[SPEAKER_00]: what should have been and this causes the
striping to occur in these particular
[SPEAKER_00]: lawns here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you could only get one just
speaking in general rotary spreader is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the more universal spreader.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can spread powdered forms of fertilizer
but it will be messy and it will clog
[SPEAKER_00]: easily but it can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is designed this rotary spreader
typically for larger eyes scott
[SPEAKER_00]: applications and this is for a reason
because of the type of material they're
[SPEAKER_00]: applying the coverage area and the
efficiency overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are some larger ones mounted on
the three-point hitches of tractors but
[SPEAKER_00]: the same could be applied to your walk
behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you want kind of a little field
comparison I shot some video here
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing a looking at two scott brand
fertilizer spreaders both a rotary
[SPEAKER_00]: spreader and a drop spreader.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to see some of the
specifics of them hopefully you enjoy the
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the field video segment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we have here are two spreaders
they each have vastly different purposes
[SPEAKER_00]: so you don't want to use them for the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first fertilizer spreader here is
called a rotary spreader and just as a
[SPEAKER_00]: name implies put the fertilizer or lime
potentially in the hopper here it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to go through and work its way down and
get spun out at the bottom here and spread
[SPEAKER_00]: that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a rotary motion that goes through and
does and the advantage is the wheels kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of go through and they drive it and you
can see that it rotates as you will go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and walk the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great for large pelletized fertilizers or
in this case lime is being added.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to be able to dial it in and kind of
get an even spread throughout your field.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fertilizer spreader is called a drop
spreader and just as a name implies you
[SPEAKER_00]: put the fertilizer here and it drops
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you go through and push it it'll rotate
those causing it to basically drop it
[SPEAKER_00]: won't really spread or throw a lot and
that's why you see established here
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some arrows to try to indicate
where you should be aligning to as you go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and drop spread it because this
will offer you the kind of the advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of go through and create for a
small area of different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer maybe more powdered based can
drop through here and will only go in
[SPEAKER_00]: between those two wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: In comparison to the other fertilizer
these rotary spreader that'll actually
[SPEAKER_00]: throw the fertilizers we kind of see in
the image here it is that will kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: throw it and get a little bit larger of a
spread area compared to just in between
[SPEAKER_00]: the wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again while these are two spreaders
they each have a different purpose and
[SPEAKER_00]: should be used for that purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the rotary spreader here you have a
handle which you would grab and when you
[SPEAKER_00]: pull on that handle it will open up that
and allow that fertilizer to fall through
[SPEAKER_00]: the little hole here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you go through and walk it will rotate
that right through and how you control how
[SPEAKER_00]: much that opens is based on the dial or
the spreader setting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also determine whether it opens only this
much when you pull it this much now
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially determine how much fertilizer
you add as you walk down the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drop spreader works in a very similar
way where you have the same thing here
[SPEAKER_00]: that you would pull and that would open
the area there and as you walk and will
[SPEAKER_00]: rotate those.
[SPEAKER_00]: However what's unique here is that you
also have a setting as well that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: go through and adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the drop spreader you have a setting
here you simply dial that in here and set
[SPEAKER_00]: it to five and that will change the amount
that the drop opens indicating how much
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer you add as you go through and
walk down the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall between the two spreaders that you
see here the rotary spreader is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more universal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows for spreading of in general over
a larger area a little bit easier to
[SPEAKER_00]: spread material.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drop spreader a little bit more
specific and typically used more in a turf
[SPEAKER_00]: grass or lawn setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're only going to buy one the
rotary spreader is probably the one you
[SPEAKER_00]: should look at but as I said each have
their own purpose and make sure you get
[SPEAKER_00]: the piece of equipment that matches the
purpose for for your intended job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
