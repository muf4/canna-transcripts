[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a basic sensory system
overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I chose the picture of the
baby here is to explore the world around
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We typically use our sensory system to be
able to perceive things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we go about learning about
what things touch, taste, look like,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sensory perception, the sensory
nervous system tells the central nervous
[SPEAKER_00]: system what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we being exposed to?
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, we have sensory receptors,
which are specialized sensory cells that
[SPEAKER_00]: detect changes inside as well as outside
the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: As much as we're trying to detect what
color things are on the outside,
[SPEAKER_00]: we also want to have sensors on the inside
of our body that help us tell our internal
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have sensory organs that are complex
sensory receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examples of those would be our eyes,
our ears, our taste buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This owl here has well-adapted ears since
it hunts at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So its sensory organ of ears is
well-developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example of our eyes being able
to track what's around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The path of sensory information,
we have stimulation, which is the physical
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulus that activates sensory receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the physical touch that's
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transduction is the converting of that
stimulus into an action potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stimulus-gated ion channels in sensory
neurons are opened or closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: An action potential gradient is created,
this positive-negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: This then allows the transmission,
which is nerve impulses, to be conducted
[SPEAKER_00]: to the central nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The overview of the sensory neuron
information is, for example, here we have
[SPEAKER_00]: water coming down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put our hand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to sense what the temperature of
that water is, so our sensory endings of
[SPEAKER_00]: the skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will then lead to action potential in
the axons, transferring that sensory
[SPEAKER_00]: information going up to the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: A sensory axon enters the spinal cord,
where it synapses with the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sensory pathway continues with
secondary neurons projecting to the
[SPEAKER_00]: thalamus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sensory pathway reaches the cerebral
cortex for conscious perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're actually into the thought
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the water hot, or is the water cold?
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, an upper motor neuron from
the cortex executes a motor command.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is now leaving the brain in red,
going through the spinal cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: The upper motor neuron contacts the lower
motor neuron in the spinal cord and
[SPEAKER_00]: through our synapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This ultimately is leading to the lower
motor neuron causing contraction of the
[SPEAKER_00]: target skeletal muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That contraction will cause that hand to
move up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be away from if this water was
too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: While this sounds like a lot of steps that
are occurring, and there is quite a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: that is occurring, this occurs very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That nerve impulse occurs at about 268-ish
miles an hour, so it's a very quick
[SPEAKER_00]: process for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The path of sensory information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two types of sensory receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our exoreceptors, as the name
implies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sense stimulus in the external
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just touch heat or pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Introreceptors are sensed similarly in the
internal environment, in the gut or other
[SPEAKER_00]: internal organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we see here, our free nerve endings are
spread throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, in the skin, this would be
for sensing the presence of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Internal organs, we see them listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These all need senses and information that
may be occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we may not think we can feel
them directly, the body needs to have that
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensing the internal environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Verbets use many different sensory
receptors to respond to changes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: internal environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examples of these would be temperature
change, two nerve endings in the skin,
[SPEAKER_00]: one similar by cold, one by warmth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you actually have a separate one.
[SPEAKER_00]: One just does not do temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: One does hot, one does cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blood chemistry, receptors in our arteries
to sense blood carbon dioxide levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pain, special nerve endings within
tissue near the surface to sense for pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: just as an indication something's going
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also muscle contraction, sensory receptors
called protoreceptors are embedded within
[SPEAKER_00]: the muscle and tendons to sense this
stretch of muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Touch for pressure receptors buried below
the skin for that tactile kind of touch
[SPEAKER_00]: reception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are neurons called baroreceptors are
in major arteries to either constrict or
[SPEAKER_00]: relax our arteries for blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other types of sensory receptors that we
may not sense potentially would be heat
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors, very evident in pit vipers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here a snake here that can locate
warm prey using infrared radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These heat-detecting pit organs will allow
this snake to be able to find this mouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is looking here very warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnetism, eels, sharks, and many birds
orient themselves in relation to the
[SPEAKER_00]: earth's magnetic field, allowing them to
migrate in certain routes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why they're able to migrate over
long distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the sensory receptor of
magnetism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electricity is used by aquatic vertebrates
to locate food and mates, and also it can
[SPEAKER_00]: be used by some terrestrial organisms
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here this spiny ant eaters also use
electricity to help sense food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great link here for extreme vision
and animal science to help you understand
[SPEAKER_00]: or develop a greater appreciation for
different types of sensory systems more
[SPEAKER_00]: than just our own.
Thank you.
