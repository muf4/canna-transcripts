[SPEAKER_00]: The cloning process can require a
specialized set of tools and conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to focus on the growing
medias that are particularly used for the
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see two different types of cloning
setups here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind the one on the left here,
a little bit dirtier and not quite keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: things as clean as we should, especially
when we're looking at the success of our
[SPEAKER_00]: potential next run of plants or next
generation of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, while we still have potentially some
things off in the picture here,
[SPEAKER_00]: a much cleaner setup in this image here
than in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, keep in mind we want to keep our
cloning environment very clean to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the chance of losing our entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, a very common material used
that a lot of growers select is rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: This limits root disturbance during
transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be expensive, but moisture
consistency at times can be an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a CEC or cation exchange capacity
of zero, so plants need to be on a
[SPEAKER_00]: continuous liquid feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this material has no buffering
capacity, so the grower has to keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind and watch the pH of the solution
that they're feeding their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we might say limits root disturbance
is there is rockwool companies that make
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller cubes that can start the initial
root development and then easily be
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanted into larger cubes here,
easily fitting into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: This limits the root disturbance going
from one size or directly to another,
[SPEAKER_00]: not requiring any disturbance of the roots
initially there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also pea pellets.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are an economical option and they
give roots an area to fill in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to be monitored for even and
consistent moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a little bit of an issue,
especially starting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get everything evenly moist,
you can put the clones in there and just
[SPEAKER_00]: monitoring them so one doesn't dry out
more so than another to keep that clone
[SPEAKER_00]: going well at the early stages and
continue on to keep those roots going.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also expanded clay pellets.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are clay pieces that are processed
in very high temperatures to create these
[SPEAKER_00]: little pebbles here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They contain large and small pores,
allow for air exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be rinsed and soaked before
use to remove any of the dust that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: in the shipping container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not want to let these dry out
during any part of the growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep moisture at all times
because once they dry out, they can be
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to re-wet and re-moisten and
that could severely stress the newly
[SPEAKER_00]: developing roots of our plant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have foam or oasis blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oasis is the name brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good for plant support.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do require a sufficient time to
pre-soak.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be expensive and they will always
leave this oasis dust around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're typically used in floral
arrangements here because they're great at
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing supporting of plant stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're called that floral foam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also good if you keep even moisture to be
used for propagation process, though not
[SPEAKER_00]: commonly used a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's sand and this provides good
porosity and gives roots good aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a heavy material even when it's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in typically what we call
sandbags to make it easy to transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots can be easily disturbed though
because the sand itself will not hold much
[SPEAKER_00]: structure to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while this have some advantages of
allowing good aeration and also have some
[SPEAKER_00]: drawbacks there especially when you go to
remove the plants to go to the next
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sterilizing our growing media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this should be considered for fixed
growing media such as clay or sand or even
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're considering using soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's chemical sterilization which is
incorporating hydrogen peroxide or
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorine based products to kill organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat sticks or steam sterilization is also
recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this can be a challenge to get even
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see in this high tunnel
situation, using a steam generator here
[SPEAKER_00]: under a tarp to kind of steam sterilize at
least the surface here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also they make these complex machines that
have all these little basically pipes that
[SPEAKER_00]: poke into the soil and inject steam that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: However these are not advised for
professional operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You simply would just buy new.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's gonna be a lot of investment into
steam and it can only sterilize a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why starting with a sterilized
media to begin with can help you avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: this process and ensure you're starting
clean every time.
