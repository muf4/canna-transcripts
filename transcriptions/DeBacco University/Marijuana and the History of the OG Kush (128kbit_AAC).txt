[SPEAKER_00]: All right, in this Tobacco University
video, we're going to be investigating
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana and the history of the OG Kush,
a very famous variety you might have heard
[SPEAKER_00]: of before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while marijuana is high in THC content,
that is important to know, and while this
[SPEAKER_00]: channel does focus more on the hemp,
it's important to understand that while
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana is associated with that
recreational use in general, following and
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding the history of the famous OG
Kush strain can provide great insight into
[SPEAKER_00]: the marijuana culture in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the information is spread
through oral history and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: explanations of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just kind of serves as an example
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the OG Kush has become a worldwide
staple used for numerous famous strains
[SPEAKER_00]: like Girl Scout Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also many different phenotypes
of the OG Kush that exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: The following that I'm going to present
here is the history of the OG Kush is
[SPEAKER_00]: based on an interview with Matt Bubba
Berger, who found a bag of seed in Florida
[SPEAKER_00]: that would later become known as the OG
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original interview came on the Adam
Dunn Show, as you can see right over here,
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam Dunn right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was been very fortunate to meet him
both in Denver, Colorado, and also on the
[SPEAKER_00]: East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to hear the interview for
yourself, I've linked the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: description there as far as how to look it
up and the link to provide if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the original interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here I'm going to provide a kind of
summarized version.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the history of the OG Kush just in
general, looking at its origin,
[SPEAKER_00]: originated in Orlando, Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed came from an unknown bag of weed
in Miami in 1991.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed was called Crippy, which was really
just a generic term for good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the start of the generation that
started naming and breeding around this
[SPEAKER_00]: time frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only one plant was kept and propagated
from the limited amount of seeds that were
[SPEAKER_00]: present in the once original weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just called Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the first batch was said to look
like Kush, berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an important note to make that
there's really no such thing as a Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: berry, but they like the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it stuck and it became a popular
popular in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1996, it's made its way to Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while a lot of people think the OG Kush
is a West Coast, California based strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: the original seed did come from Orlando,
Florida in 1991.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now become how to become the OG Kush here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in 1988 started to actually become
the OG Kush and attempt to identify it as
[SPEAKER_00]: the original strain grown in Los Angeles,
grown in LA there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, it tends to be a viney
morphology and can have hermaphroditic
[SPEAKER_00]: tendencies as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally to prevent the strain from
being lost, seeds were the main form of
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how the OG Kush got spread
across the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now looking at the OG Kush, it's a quality
over quantity example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Kush is generally a poor yield or
in quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to give you like an example
of the tomatoes over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be a ton of tomatoes,
but it's going to give you a high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: and results there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the quality was above average and shops
in Amsterdam did not want to pay any more
[SPEAKER_00]: for originally since it was not well
known.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get a premium price even
though the quality was higher in
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, during 1997 to 1999 in Los
Angeles, California, it was getting top
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the Kush due to the great demand and
limited supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have an idea of what the price is
going for around that timeframe,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at 500 plus dollars per
ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was sold even before it was grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shows you how high in demand it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Kush is very much a West coast strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour diesel was dominant on the East
coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these kind of developed the West coast
is more OG Kush, East coast more of that
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now limited starting materials mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Kush strain can be traced back to
an original, literally few seeds that were
[SPEAKER_00]: found in an ounce of weed way back in the
early nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very rare for this limited starting
material to become such a successful
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember it is possible if you think
about developing your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some people who have feminized
it and generated their own versions of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But original has been kept for these
special unique terpene profile that it
[SPEAKER_00]: does possess here to find that true in
original.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now past the present down to give you that
kind of like just quick summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt Bubba Berger has been growing the
same plant propagated via clones for about
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 years up to this, up to the publication
of this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, the end product is unchanged,
but the leaf morphology has gone from more
[SPEAKER_00]: of the traditional kind of five fingered
leaves to more funky random morphology
[SPEAKER_00]: over that many years of propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yield has dropped a little bit,
but over this time, however, the chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles remain like the original.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the importance of kind of clones
are maintaining a strain over a long
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the point he interviewed here,
he was growing it for 18 continuous years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, it's a slight difference
in plant morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the key part is that chemical and
terpene profile remain the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: giving that OG Kush reason for why it's
still around to this day is it's for its
[SPEAKER_00]: unique terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And uniqueness to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's still respected and known
to the present day.
