[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be looking at animal
hair descriptive characteristics and some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the distinguishing factors that we look
at when we're looking at hair,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly at the microscopic level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with why is animal hair in
general important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if evidence shows animal hair
present, it can generate questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as if the victim does not own a dog,
it could interfere with suspect owns a dog
[SPEAKER_00]: or has come in contact with a dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, DNA can be removed from animals
mouth if bitten and blood samples can be
[SPEAKER_00]: removed from animals fur, feet,
or etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at why is animal
hair important, even in forensics
[SPEAKER_00]: investigation, identifying animal hair can
be very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different types of animal hair,
so keep in mind when we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison different hair types on
animals, we are often looking at guard
[SPEAKER_00]: hairs, which are thicker, longer,
straight, and form the outer protective
layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fur or wool hairs are thinner,
often soft, king to end, not straight,
[SPEAKER_00]: and found close to the skin forming an
insulating inner coat to the animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have tactile hairs,
which provide sensory functions and
[SPEAKER_00]: typically found at the head of animals
such as the whiskers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just kind of see this quick comparison
here of here's the dog, here's the guard
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and here's the under fur hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just see from the same dog this
stark difference in those animal hair
[SPEAKER_00]: types just on quick visual inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both at 400 times magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the cuticle scale pattern is another
area we want to be looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the imbricate scales that are
random overlapping patterns much like roof
[SPEAKER_00]: tiles and are often flattened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's that example here of the
imbricate kind of scale pattern that we
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the spinous, which are scales
of spiny long and pointed appearance that
[SPEAKER_00]: overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can definitely see that here in
the mink hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the coronal, which are
crown-like scale pattern, which is very
[SPEAKER_00]: fine hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a stack of paper cups common
in small rodents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bats is very rare in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example here of bat hair and
we can see clearly how it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctive on a visual basis compared to
the mink hair here or just kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: unidentified animal here with the
imbricate scale pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an important method of being
able to identify or at least classifying
[SPEAKER_00]: the hair in a particular species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to the cortex color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a wide range of natural
colors and shadings that do occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see a couple of them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have guard hairs of a black bear,
a brown bear and a polar bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just quick on that cortex color.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the region right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the differences as well here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those colors in shadings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the medulla description
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are we kind of going through and
describing the different medulla regions
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's remember the medulla is the
innermost layer of the hair and serves as
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the marrow of the hair,
that center portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's composed of air-filled components
that are typically harder to see in human
[SPEAKER_00]: hair compared to other animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking here at the coyote, the harbor
seal and the raccoon, we can definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: see some major differences in how we
classify the different medulla patterns
[SPEAKER_00]: that we notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those patterns, specifically,
we're looking at, it could be absinthe,
[SPEAKER_00]: they could be fragmented, they could be
intermittent or they could be continuous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's just one example of looking
kind of from a far away microscopic view
[SPEAKER_00]: of the fissure cat on how we definitely
see a unique medulla pattern here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's just that quick kind of
comparison, amorous, amorous, a serial,
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-serial, a cellular or a lattice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this amorphous kind of shape here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get into the lattice, the
multi-serial, the uniserial, very
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctive patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're going to see some examples
of those here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, starting with the amorphous
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: It appears as a solid line, but lacks a
clear pattern or structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we're noticing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at a Jersey cow's hair sample
at 400, I'm sorry, at 40 microns here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of this amorphous
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not familiar with a Jersey
cow, that's what one looks like there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The uniserial has one ladder row of
components running down the hair
[SPEAKER_00]: longitudinally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's kind of what the general image
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the example of that would be guinea
pig here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see that uniserial pattern here
to the medulla.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a happy little guinea pig
there looking at the camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the multi-serial here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is looking at an example of
rabbit hair would fall under this
[SPEAKER_00]: category.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has multiple ladder rows,
components running down the hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, in that longitudinal direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that evident here,
keeping at the same magnification of 40
[SPEAKER_00]: microns here with rabbit hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the cellular, where we're
looking at a wide band of randomly shaped
[SPEAKER_00]: cell-like structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the silver fox would be an example
here of this medulla pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at each one of these bars,
we're running 10 micrometers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this lattice structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can occupy nearly the entire width
of the hair with small circular shaped
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look really closely here at this
deer hair sample, we definitely see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there's filled, there's
partially filled.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be considered filled of this
white tail deer in the image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have something also called the
medulla index.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this describes the thickness of the
medulla layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In humans, the value of the medulla index
is usually about one third or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that of animal hair is typically one
half or greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how we get that is looking at the
diameter of the medulla compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: diameter of the actual hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we go about that calculation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, using a microscope that would
ideally have some way of measuring that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The index, this medulla index is
calculated by dividing the medulla width
[SPEAKER_00]: by the width of the entire cortex here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd write those two numbers down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We divide those two and we multiply by 100
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the medulla diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the total width there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would simply divide those two to
get this medulla index.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can be important for
identification, for classifying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, this still always falls
under that area of class evidence,
[SPEAKER_00]: not individual evidence, but still
important to document.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're looking at developing and
understanding and comparison of different
[SPEAKER_00]: animal hairs, as we saw in the images in
this presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the total width of the medulla
index.
