[SPEAKER_00]: Within growing media, what's becoming very
popular now is having companies add
[SPEAKER_00]: biological components to their mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These biological components typically
include fungi or bacteria, fungi being
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizae or trichoderma species,
bacteria being bacillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put them on petri dishes,
they may look something like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they come to add them to help benefit
the plant or reduce pathogens is the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these pre-indoculated mixes,
while there's some advantages to
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially reducing pathogens,
typically would be best to add the
[SPEAKER_00]: material yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here, for example, this pro-mix has
mycorrhizae added.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are living components, all have
shelf life, and it's best to add fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: material that you know if it's within the
stated shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if you're buying your
soilless mix here in large bulk and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: only using a portion of it and you're
saving it, the shelf life of those
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes could degrade over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those grower added mixes allows the grower
to know that fresh product has been added.
[SPEAKER_00]: It offers the opportunity for growers to
address specific issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at reducing damping off,
for example, you may want to add products
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically for that purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: This provides flexibility to change the
mix based on your application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just two examples here of some have blend
products where they're adding not only
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizae products, but bacillus and
trichoderma blends all in one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with a couple of nutrients,
and that's common in both of these
[SPEAKER_00]: products here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to look for the
propagation, propagules per gram,
[SPEAKER_00]: or CFU's colony forming units per gram
when you're looking at comparing the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial density of certain products.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this brings up a question of are
they worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be a debated topic, and in the
controlled cases where many other plant
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements are being maximized,
such as light, nutrients, and water,
[SPEAKER_00]: the positive effects of these microbes
might be reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, increase in the cost may not
be justified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're looking at typically the cost of
some of these products versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're maximizing light, nutrients,
and water, and potentially carbon dioxide,
[SPEAKER_00]: the availability and the benefits of these
added microbes may not be worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they do any harm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, no, but the cost may be cost
prohibitive in the sense that you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: adding more cost to the situation and not
getting necessarily a return for that in
[SPEAKER_00]: the end product.
Thank you.
