[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to go over your
harvesting and curing of squash,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the curing process, which I'm going to
focus on here, applies only to your winter
[SPEAKER_00]: squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Summer squash will be harvested daily and
sold with a relatively short shelf life,
[SPEAKER_00]: but curing a winter squash can
significantly increase its shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for our winter squash, the length of
time that you can store it will depend on
[SPEAKER_00]: the particular variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delicata will only store for about three
months, while some others can last almost
[SPEAKER_00]: a calendar year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to harvest in mid to late
September, or about 60 days from
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often color can be a poor indicator,
so look at the stem and the days from
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination as an indication whether that
will be ready for curing and harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to cut the stem right at the
vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to bring all of your squash from
the field and store them in an area of
[SPEAKER_00]: about 80 degrees Fahrenheit for about a
week with some sun and some good air
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to put them in an area that's
going to hold a lot of moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open bins, slotted bins here made out of
pallets, allow for air circulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you some links here for some
fact sheets and some ideas on how to
[SPEAKER_00]: properly cure your squash so you get the
longest storage time possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
