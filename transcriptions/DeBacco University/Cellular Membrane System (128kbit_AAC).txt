[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to be going over some
of the cellular membranes located within a
[SPEAKER_00]: cell, and a lot of these will apply to
both plants and animal cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting off with just a general parts
list, you can see located just below me
[SPEAKER_00]: here, a typical animal cell as an example,
but again, a lot of these will apply to
[SPEAKER_00]: both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are members, organelles,
these organelles that have membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most obviously we have the plasma
membrane, and that's responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: regulating what comes in and out of a
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the nucleus, which is where most
of the DNA is kept, and that's where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be, the cell will be regulating
the expression of those genes for those
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mitochondria is your energy or ATP
synthesis portion of the cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: and remember those are located in both
plants and animal cells, unlike the
[SPEAKER_00]: chloroplasts, which are energy for carbon
fixation, found only in plant cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the endoplasmic reticulum,
which is your protein processing and
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane synthesis, and there's both rough
and smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Golgi, which is responsible for the
modification and transport of vital
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins within a cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vesicles, responsible for taking things
in, in little compartments, and also
[SPEAKER_00]: things leaving or exiting the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some non-membrane structures,
just to point some of those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ribosomes, they're just responsible for
protein synthesis, they don't have that
[SPEAKER_00]: specific membrane bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the cytoskeleton, which is for
cell structure and strength, and so
[SPEAKER_00]: mobility, and transport within a cell,
moving materials throughout the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when we talk about mitosis and cell
division, some of those components can be
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have the extracellular matrix,
which is responsible for cells adhering to
[SPEAKER_00]: one another, cells moving, and cells kind
of interacting or communicating certain
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins with other cells in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in animal cells, as I mentioned,
we just kind of have some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane proteins here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a nice little diagram here
locating and pointing them out what they
[SPEAKER_00]: look like, in a general sense,
at least in a cartoon image.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you kind of an appreciation for
all those little components within an
[SPEAKER_00]: animal cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't be complete unless we had a
plant cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this here, and a lot of the
same components as well, some a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the vacuole is much larger in
a plant cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this endomembrane system, so we're
looking at this entire kind of how this
[SPEAKER_00]: works together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a series of membranes that are
part of the cell, and because we have
[SPEAKER_00]: these membranes, we have these little
compartments, and this allows isolation of
[SPEAKER_00]: specific components within the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The true system here involves the nucleus
with the nuclear envelope, the rough and
[SPEAKER_00]: smooth ER, the Golgi apparatus,
the vesicles, to help this kind of whole
[SPEAKER_00]: process kind of come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're located in this kind of vicinity
and this sequence to allow those genes to
[SPEAKER_00]: be in the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be able to produce final proteins that
may be used within the cell or excreted
[SPEAKER_00]: outside the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these little protein structures
contain enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So enzymes are a specific type of protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: They catalyze the removal of electrons and
associate hydrogen ions, looking
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically here at the paroxysomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have their own little kind of
membrane, creating this little vesicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very similar to a lysosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a membrane down, kind of
container here, containing enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, these paroxysomes have an active
in lipid metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the breakdown of fats.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have oxidative enzymes, peroxidases
for fatty acid oxidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They catalyze reactions to produce
hydrogen peroxide H2O2.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very toxic and will be broken down
into water and oxygen gas by a catalyze
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: In plant cells and also in animal cells,
which is often not regarded, there are
[SPEAKER_00]: vacuoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are found in both.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're for food storage and water
regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The membranous sacs are larger than a
small vesicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They store materials that are in excess
and they can be very specialized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the plant cell, they're quite large
and pronounced.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are present in animal cells,
but tend to be quite smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: These vacuoles, looking here at a plant
cell, typically we have that one central
[SPEAKER_00]: vacuole, can be up to 90% of the volume of
those cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They function in water storage,
nutrients, pigments, and waste products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Development of turgor pressure as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some functions performed by lysosomes and
other eukaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say turgor pressure,
let's just think of it as water pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: within a cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's allowing that kind of
swelling and contracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like water pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: More specifically, that turgor pressure in
plant cells, that kind of water pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: is what's maintaining the osmosis within a
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether if you've ever seen a plant that
you haven't watered in a little while and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of wilted, kind of getting that
kind of wilted look to it has a very low
[SPEAKER_00]: turgor pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant cells have that cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to maintain that high,
that turgid pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to keep that kind of plant
upright, those stems upright, and be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to move water through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they kind of lose that turgor
pressure, they, what we call, become
[SPEAKER_00]: flaccid or wilted on the initial onset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's kind of going on here at
a cellular level.
[SPEAKER_00]: That water is leaving the cell and that
vacuole is shrinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
