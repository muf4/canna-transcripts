[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to look at evolution
getting there from here, kind of helping
[SPEAKER_00]: explaining origin of certain structures,
certain organisms, and certain species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with evolution in general,
there's looking at this, we're seeing that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's evidence of macroevolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what macroevolution is, is the
evolutionary change on a grand scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: This encompasses the origin of new species
and major episodes of extinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So macro, things just like it is,
large scale changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microevolution are evolutionary changes,
as you would guess, on a small scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it encompasses genetic changes that
will occur within populations over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: These changes are the result of changes in
gene frequencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here our gene frequencies for
certain colors have changed in these
[SPEAKER_00]: butterfly wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we also have the squirrels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our gray squirrel, our black
squirrel, and our white squirrel here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These would be microevolutions,
simply a change in color.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all still squirrels.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all still butterflies and wings
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just seeing a microevolution change.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could really impact whether or not an
individual can survive or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still it's considered a
microevolution, a small change versus a
[SPEAKER_00]: macro, which is a large scale change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So putting it together, macro refers to
the changes in organisms over time that
[SPEAKER_00]: are so important that the newer organism
would be considered a whole new species.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way to think of the
macroevolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microevolution and macroevolution both
happen in the same way and for the same
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But micro is more that kind of change in
coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And macro is the potential extinction or
creation of a new species there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's our comparison between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting there from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lamarck here are many and many others
prior to Darwin and Wallace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to that, theories developed by those
two thought biological evolution occurred
[SPEAKER_00]: by what's called acquired characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a trait that an organism develops
through interactions with the environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: involves pass on offspring, body and
behavior changes acquired during their
[SPEAKER_00]: lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gave some examples here, and this
ends up not being the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for example, the manatee with the
scars in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens usually with boats that run
into them, sadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acquired characteristics mean if all the
manatees had these scrape marks,
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually they would pass on these scrape
marks to their offspring or individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone continually got pierced ears,
eventually their offspring would have
[SPEAKER_00]: pierced ears naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the black spots on the leaves here,
eventually the offspring would have black
[SPEAKER_00]: spots on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the concept of acquired
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now again, this is not what happens,
but this is what Lamarck thought and this
[SPEAKER_00]: was his theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in contrast to Darwin and Wallace,
they proposed variation is an inherited
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics of all biological
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not created by an experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's readily observed in all populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just look around at the variance
that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the example here of some shells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see some different patterns,
some different colorations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the idea that the body has a certain
number and amount of genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get passed on to the egg for the
embryo to then develop from our punnet
[SPEAKER_00]: squares and our odds of getting certain
alleles and combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here again, number alleles for
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's very short, it's very tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the mean, the average.
[SPEAKER_00]: These acquired characteristics do not hold
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back here, we're not acquiring
these characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are variation based on genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not created by experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's created by the genetics of the
individual, not the experience that the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual may or may not have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lamarck again compared to Darwin,
Lamarck was idea of the giraffes is his
[SPEAKER_00]: primary example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he came up with the idea that by
reaching higher for vegetation,
[SPEAKER_00]: giraffes simply stretch their necks and as
a result, this results in them acquiring
[SPEAKER_00]: longer necks in their offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Darwin believed that giraffes were born
with longer necks and are better able to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive in their offspring and therefore
have more offspring who inherit longer
[SPEAKER_00]: necks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this nice comparison between
these two scientists at the time and it
[SPEAKER_00]: holds true even today, scientists that
debate one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to support our ideas with
evidence and this is how we develop and
[SPEAKER_00]: refine different theories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lamarck's environmental role was a
stimulus to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Darwin, the environment's role was a
selector.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organism's role in Lamarck's was
active.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Darwin, it was passive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the genes that you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this didn't change and it's basically
regardless, it's a slow and rapid change
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless of what scientists you look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part is here, Darwin believed in
the inherent of genetics, Lamarck believed
[SPEAKER_00]: in the acquired traits and inherent is
definitely with the DNA the way that this
[SPEAKER_00]: does occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evidence or standard view of Darwin was
that evolutionary change occurred
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely slowly and these changes
accumulate such that over thousands or
[SPEAKER_00]: millions of years major changes could
occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This term is called gradualism and here's
our horse that I explained in the overview
[SPEAKER_00]: of evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see how it's changed both in size and
structure, but it's occurred over a long
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give the examples of over millions of
years we can get these major changes that
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: They occur slowly and over time,
but over these millions of years we get
[SPEAKER_00]: these large changes that can occur and
that's referred to the pace of evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So punctuate equilibrium hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is evolutionary change occurs in
bursts separated by long periods of little
[SPEAKER_00]: or no evolutionary change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here gradualism where we're
slowly getting a lighter and lighter and
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here punctuated equilibrium is where
things definitely diverge and change.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden we get a white one and
that white basically doesn't change for
[SPEAKER_00]: this time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get the kind of the more orange and
red-ish color, tan color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, that changes and that stays pretty
consistent for a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is referred to as punctuated
equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gradualism refers to just slowly that
change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here there's definitely these break off
points and while it's a white one here,
[SPEAKER_00]: it stays a white one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not constant changing that's
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's abrupt changes that occur in the
time scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So examples of both gradualism punctuated
equilibrium do exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So speciation clearly occurs in different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be the same example here of
starting with the green butterfly and
[SPEAKER_00]: progressing to these two colors with
gradualism and here's how it looks with
[SPEAKER_00]: punctuated equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have the idea that speciation is
necessarily linked to phenotypic change
[SPEAKER_00]: has not been supported.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing that speciation can occur
without phenotypic change and phenotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: change can occur within a species in the
absence of speciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at that morphological
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not looking in any of these cases at
the genetics, we're just looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypic change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rate of replication, different organisms
do evolve at different rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacteria evolve much faster than
eukaryotes because they have a simpler
[SPEAKER_00]: base pair unit in their genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can occur much faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus mammals, amphibians, and flowering
plants, a much larger, again this is base
[SPEAKER_00]: pairs, many more base pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes a lot longer for these to
change enough genes to cause a shift in
[SPEAKER_00]: that organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the rate of evolution, that
punctuated equilibrium is that branching
[SPEAKER_00]: that occurs and gradualism is that steady
change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genome size, again the base pair,
this is more of a visual, the mutation
[SPEAKER_00]: rate, and the genome size.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that the larger the genome size,
the longer it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So viruses can change very quickly,
relatively speaking, compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: eukaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what makes viruses a little bit
harder to kind of combat.
[SPEAKER_00]: To control, because they can change from
year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eukaryotes can also change, but it takes
them millions of years, a lot slower rate
[SPEAKER_00]: of evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still occurs, again it can be gradualism
or the punctuated, but the rate that the
[SPEAKER_00]: change occurs is dependent on the mutation
rate, which changes based on the base
[SPEAKER_00]: pair, or the number of base pairs that
individual organism has for DNA sequences.
Thank you.
