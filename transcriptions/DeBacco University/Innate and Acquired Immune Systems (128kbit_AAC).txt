[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're gonna look at the innate and
the acquired branches of the immune
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you might be wondering why I chose to
include these pictures here on the title
[SPEAKER_00]: slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I included the bird's nest as kind
of to address the word innate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Birds hatch out of eggs, they come out of
the nest and they fly away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're never taught how to make a nest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have that innate ability to make a
nest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus acquiring, being able to acquire
and build something, such as engineers
[SPEAKER_00]: here have to acquire materials and draw it
out and learn the different symbols to
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this relates to the immune system and
you'll see how.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the innate versus the acquired immune
system, there's two key differences in the
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here some of the macrophages,
the dendritic cells, the xenophils,
[SPEAKER_00]: all are part of the innate immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adaptive, which is also called the
acquired immune system, involved mainly B
[SPEAKER_00]: cells and T cells in the production of
antibodies, CD4 T cells and CD8.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to kind of put that into a flow chart,
our innate, so we have our immune system
[SPEAKER_00]: acquired in innate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our innate here is blood-borne kind of
phagocytes, such as our neutrophils,
[SPEAKER_00]: macrophages, our basophils, natural killer
cells, the xenophils, all those are under
[SPEAKER_00]: the innate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physical barriers are also included under
the innate immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those include our skin, our mucous
membranes, saliva, tears, stomach acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: all those listed under the innate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the acquired is those T and B cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some helper T cells and suppressor
T cells, antibodies under the moral
[SPEAKER_00]: immunity through the B cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are much more specific and these
have to be acquired over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where our body starts to develop
antibodies and help remember and carry
[SPEAKER_00]: over some information from an initial
exposure in case that was to show up
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting this in more of a pictorial form,
comparing the innate to the acquired,
[SPEAKER_00]: the innate is nonspecific, meaning you
were born with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fast-acting, occurs within a few
hours, as we see here at the timetable
[SPEAKER_00]: down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It includes physical barriers as well as
chemical and immune cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of those physical barriers include
skin, hair, cilia, mucous, digestive
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes, and stomach acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some internal defenses can be complement
proteins, phagocytotic cells, and natural
[SPEAKER_00]: killer cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not specific but very
quick-acting.
[SPEAKER_00]: These might be kind of the first ones on
site to a potential source of infection
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of these you are basically born
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting more specific are acquired or
adaptive immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is antigen-specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it has a lag time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice our timetable down here is not
hours but days now because it requires
[SPEAKER_00]: time to process and recognize potential
invaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: It includes memory for future infections,
which is great and is in part what makes
[SPEAKER_00]: vaccines effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adaptive immune system has antibodies,
cell-mediated immune response,
[SPEAKER_00]: and memory response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these are very important
components of the immune system,
[SPEAKER_00]: some you're born with, and some you
acquire and build up over time.
