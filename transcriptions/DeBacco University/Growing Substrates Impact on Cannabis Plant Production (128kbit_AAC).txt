[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever wondered how growing
substrates can impact cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_00]: production?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here in this video, we're going to
look at a scientific article and do some
[SPEAKER_00]: comparisons of some common growing
substrates and just see how they do impact
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Tobacco University video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into how growing substrates
impact cannabis plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as always, here is the article,
here's the citation, here's the first
[SPEAKER_00]: page, here's the link to it, where you can
always find more details of the
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can provide you with the highlights
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the substrate composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the different subjects that were
looked at in this study?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see terms like PM,
G30, and CC.
[SPEAKER_00]: PM stands for peat mix, G30 stands for
peat mix substituted with 30% green fiber,
[SPEAKER_00]: and CC stands for pure coconut fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're also seeing the term,
the abbreviation, I should say DAP,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that stands for days after
pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pot size during experiment and CM is
provided right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these experiments were conducted
between March 4th, 2019 to April 9th,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could see kind of the details of
the components of each of the substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the mean or average plant height
of the genotypes studied?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the details of the study,
there are some more specifics provided,
[SPEAKER_00]: but here we're just looking at the
substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This line or dotted line here represents
the vegetative growth and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: generative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is usually a lot of growers call
this the flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will notice that overall the
growing plant trend and plant height
[SPEAKER_00]: measured in centimeters, and we see the
statistical difference here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at the comparison,
kind of what ended up overall being the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest for plant height was the PM
followed by the G30, followed by the CC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a reminder here, the PM is that
peat mix, that G30 is that peat mix
[SPEAKER_00]: substituted with 30% green fiber,
and that CC there is the coconut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could see again how that comparison
occurred over the days after planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what does the actual plants look
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of a good just general
comparison here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we looked at all the numbers,
it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what do the actual plants look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only the plants as we see here in the
above image, but also the root structure
[SPEAKER_00]: of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see some differences here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coconut fiber causing the greatest degree
of kind of spacing out the roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: the greatest area of surface area of
coverage, and the peat mix plus 30% green
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber showing a little bit more denser
pockets in regions there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see also how that impacted the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant growth here on the above portion
of the plant, which growers typically most
[SPEAKER_00]: associate with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the research conclusion?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw the data, we saw the pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did the researchers actually have to
say after doing this study?
[SPEAKER_00]: They said that there was a limiting effect
on the CBD and CBA content enacted by the
[SPEAKER_00]: different substrates could not be
confirmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that one substrate didn't
necessarily produce any higher CBD or CBA
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plants that were studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be concluded that the use of
organic green fibers to partially replace
[SPEAKER_00]: fractionated peat showed genotype specific
option for consistent plant development.
[SPEAKER_00]: A comparable high biomass yield and stable
cannabinoid content compared to a standard
[SPEAKER_00]: peat containing standard mix there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that kind of mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of times when growers are
changing different substrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to wonder how that's going
to impact the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a study here looking at
specific cannabinoid content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really they concluded that there
wasn't really that much of a difference
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the CBD and CBA content extracted from
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's important as growers when we're
looking at potential cost or potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: changing different substrates or if
manufacturers are changing different
[SPEAKER_00]: substrates, how's that going to impact our
plant, specifically a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a great study here that shows
some information in graphical form,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the morphology of the above
plant structure, as well as the below
[SPEAKER_00]: plant structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers can get a better understanding
in a controlled study of how their
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate may impact their plants.
