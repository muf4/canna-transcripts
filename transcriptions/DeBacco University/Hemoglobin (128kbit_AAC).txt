[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at a very
important protein structure called
[SPEAKER_00]: hemoglobin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's involved in our red blood cells and
is vital to keep us alive to allow oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: and carbon dioxide to be exchanged within
our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hemoglobin first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxygen moves within the circulatory
system, piggybacking on the protein called
[SPEAKER_00]: hemoglobin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a protein, its shape is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemoglobin contains iron, which combines
with oxygen in a reversible way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good thing it's reversible because
we want oxygen to bind and also be
[SPEAKER_00]: released through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want hemoglobin to transport our
carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you an idea of the chemical
structure, Fe is that iron located in the
[SPEAKER_00]: center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually if you compare this to
chloroplast in plants, it actually is a
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar structure with magnesium
being in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hemoglobin, each hemoglobin molecule
can carry four oxygen atoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The presence of oxygen turns hemoglobin a
bright red.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not bound with oxygen,
there will still be a shade of red,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not quite that bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bright, vibrant red.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the binding here of our oxygen
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see one bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the options for two being bound,
for three being bound, and then for four.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that same image kind of pictured here.
[SPEAKER_00]: T state and R state.
[SPEAKER_00]: T stands for tense state.
[SPEAKER_00]: R stands for relaxed state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, kind of that relaxed state of that
fully four oxygen molecules being bound to
[SPEAKER_00]: that hemoglobin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, each red blood cell has
multiple, many, many hemoglobin molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's allowing it to bind lots of
oxygen and transport that to cells that
[SPEAKER_00]: are actively respiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, when oxygen binds,
it causes a conformational change in the
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we can see here is our change
deoxygenated versus our oxygenated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's a change in shape
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-planar versus planar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is a protein, again,
shape is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, what can impact proteins?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, heat is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, pH is another factor that can affect
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here a decrease in pH causes
greater release of oxygen from hemoglobin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, pH of 7.4 to 7.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that shift, that noticeable
shift in the effect of the saturation of
[SPEAKER_00]: the oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why our blood is kept in a very
tight pH range.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want the protein hemoglobin to be able
to function properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something in the news that you hear quite
a bit is carbon monoxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I want to make sure I mention that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon monoxide binds tighter to
hemoglobin than oxygen, not allowing for
[SPEAKER_00]: these gases to be carried.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what's occurring?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at this here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at our oxygen bound to
hemoglobin and here's our pressure of
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're noticing under normal hemoglobin,
with no carbon monoxide bound,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can bind this much of our oxygen,
a high amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we start increasing our carbon
monoxide, there's 20% carbon monoxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40%, 60%, we see this plateau occurring
very early, not allowing us to carry
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially enough oxygen, which could
either allow us, in a good case,
[SPEAKER_00]: to pass out or potentially die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anemia, in that normal hemoglobin,
we had this severe anemia, this is another
[SPEAKER_00]: way to kind of graphically represent that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, our blood and our body system may need
about this much oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how carbon monoxide can
negatively impact that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it does is it's kind of clogging up
the binding sites, not allowing oxygen to
[SPEAKER_00]: give it anywhere to bind to and be carried
by the red blood cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of found this a little humorous
there, where we have hemoglobin with
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen and it tends to bind tighter to
carbon monoxide and as a result,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will kick out oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we kind of see that representing kind
of a funny way here, but there is some
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting science and if the graphs don't
help you remember it, maybe this will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, carbon monoxide poisoning,
I feel I should mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are
basically symptoms of low oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, carbon monoxide is tasteless,
odorless gas that we can't detect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dizziness, headaches, impairment of our
brain function, ultimately could be a coma
[SPEAKER_00]: and muscle weakness, cramps, nausea,
all these are examples of carbon monoxide
[SPEAKER_00]: poisoning, extremely deadly poisonous gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for comparison, carbon dioxide,
which is in your body right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the amount of the percentage that you
may have, so one, three, five,
[SPEAKER_00]: or eight percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight percent's extremely high and that
can cause unconsciousness and tremors.
[SPEAKER_00]: One percent just could be drowsiness,
three percent because we reduced hearing,
[SPEAKER_00]: increased heart rate and blood pressure,
your blood's trying to move and get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: some of that carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five percent could be shortness of breath,
dizziness, confusion, headache,
[SPEAKER_00]: and eight percent's a serious case,
even dimmed sight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, keep in mind there's a difference
between carbon dioxide and carbon
monoxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: With dioxide being a lot easier to have or
a lot easier to recover from, then
[SPEAKER_00]: monoxide, this binds very tight to your
hemoglobin molecules.
So, keep in mind there's a difference
between carbon dioxide and carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: monoxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, keep in mind there's a difference
between carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.
