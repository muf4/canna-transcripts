[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we're going to get into some basics
of Lewis dot structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that name, exactly how it looks,
we see a bunch of dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: These dots are referring to or
representing the valence electrons of
[SPEAKER_00]: individual atoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at bonding between atoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice we use these lines to indicate
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get this in a little more detail and
also run through some examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with Lewis dot structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are often used to show how bonding
between atoms occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are some basics to show individual
atoms and also some simple atomic bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that represented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These bonds, these lines indicate these
atoms are bound together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for developing a Lewis dot structure,
our step one is to determine the total
[SPEAKER_00]: number of valence electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to look at the pure act table to
determine this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping in mind, family one has one
valence electron, family two is two
[SPEAKER_00]: valence electrons, family 13 has three
valence electrons, 14 has four valence,
[SPEAKER_00]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be aware that family 18, the noble
gases, typically have eight except for
[SPEAKER_00]: helium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Lewis dot step two, we want to
determine the total number of electrons
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to fill each atom's outer shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the octet rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every atom would like to have eight
valence electrons, whether it's shared or
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's oxygen represented by the red.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see one, two, three, four,
five, six valence electrons, what it
[SPEAKER_00]: typically has.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because it's covalently bonded with
carbon, it kind of can share two more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, they count as part of oxygen
and it will have eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing goes for this oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these electrons are being shared,
carbon typically has four, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: borrowing two electrons or sharing two
electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: From this oxygen atom and sharing two from
this oxygen atom, so it has also eight
[SPEAKER_00]: following that octet rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now step three is to draw out the elements
on your paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, the element with the least
number of particles goes in the center and
[SPEAKER_00]: there should be some symmetry to your
layout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this example, we don't have all
these oxygens at the bottom are all
[SPEAKER_00]: clustered over in one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're typically going to be fairly evenly
spaced out because that's what the
[SPEAKER_00]: generally the most stable structure is.
[SPEAKER_00]: For different molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step four, two electrons shared between
two atoms form a bond and draw two
[SPEAKER_00]: elements between atoms to form a chemical
bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here, bonds are hydrogens bound
to our nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that evident here with these
lines representing two electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two, what we call unshared pairs
of electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are located here and those are
left as two dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: These electrons that are being shared are
represented by a line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now putting the steps together,
our step one is we have two fluorine atoms
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our two elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step two, I'm going to bond them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see these two are forming a bond and
they're being shared between these two and
[SPEAKER_00]: that will then be transferred into a line.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are individual atoms forming
molecules in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to go through here some simple
examples to go through and see if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: develop a Lewis dot structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For these individual atoms and also the
molecule of carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take a moment here, pause the video,
hopefully you will, and try it for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself before I reveal the answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully now you've paused the video and
have a chance to try this on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully you come up with answers
that look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember calcium would have two,
oxygen is one, two, three, four,
[SPEAKER_00]: five, six, boron would have three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium, okay, would have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember it's in group one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfur here, two, three, four,
five, six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Xs are representing the
electrons with the carbon and the red ones
[SPEAKER_00]: with oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here as the example I showed
previously, this is following the octet
[SPEAKER_00]: rule for this very simple molecule of
carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that helps explain a little bit
about Lewis dot structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
