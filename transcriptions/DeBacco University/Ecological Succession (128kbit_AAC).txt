[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to get ecological
succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this is basically referring to is if
we look at the same block area,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're seeing is initially starting
with either a soil-based or a rock-based
[SPEAKER_00]: and progressing to some weedy species,
progressing to some grass, maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: low-growing shrubs, to some mid-growing
shrubs, ultimately to tall trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this kind of transition that occurs
to form this forest from something that
[SPEAKER_00]: was originally barren is the process of
ecological succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take this a little bit more
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the definition of ecological
succession is replacement of one community
[SPEAKER_00]: by another until a stable stage is
reached.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecosystems do tend to change with time
until a stable system is formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may occur in a short period of time
or an extremely long period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part here is over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're transitioning until a stable system
is formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stable system will form depending on
the climatic limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't mean that all ecosystems are
going to reach the same stable form.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stable form is going to be determined
by the climate in which geographic
[SPEAKER_00]: location that we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it involves three critical concepts.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the picture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: First come our weedy r-selected species
that are tolerant of harsh antibiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see the weeds always grow in areas
regardless of whether it's good years or
[SPEAKER_00]: bad years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part here is their r-selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: This r-selected, if you remember,
they produce lots of offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're very tolerant of a variety of
conditions because there's so many of them
[SPEAKER_00]: and they have a high degree of genetic
variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on with facilitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the habit changes are
introduced that favor other less weedy
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've gone from just pure weeds to kind
of, in this case, development of some
[SPEAKER_00]: flower species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less weedy and getting more established.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's no barren soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pictured here in the facilitation step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, here we have inhibition,
habitat change that may inhibit the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: of the original species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a tall tree growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tree is going to produce large leaves
that are going to shade out other
[SPEAKER_00]: potential species that were responsible
for the establishment of that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we talk about when inhibition,
tall tree will inhibit maybe these
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerant species or even these less weedy
species that started to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the process of succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an ecosystem, mature, more
case-selected species, remember these
[SPEAKER_00]: produce less offspring, replace the
r-selected ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So species richness and total biomass
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, net productivity will decrease in
this instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thus, agricultural systems are maintained
in early successional stages to keep net
[SPEAKER_00]: high productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this kind of mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, by tilling an area, monocropping,
meaning growing only one crop in long
[SPEAKER_00]: rows, we're actually keeping the system in
early succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of room for establishment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because this is very highly
productive, at least when planted like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Case-selected species, such as large oak
trees or maple trees, they're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit less in the productivity,
but they're going to increase that overall
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Succession occurs because we can see
succession occurring over years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this climate model shows the movement
of the Midwestern prairie climate to the
[SPEAKER_00]: forest zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it starts at 1890 and it estimates its
progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see that this area here is
progressing its way northward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there is a prediction here,
this goes all the way to 2090.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that overall the progression
here is north.
[SPEAKER_00]: This occurs because each community changes
the conditions so they are more favorable
[SPEAKER_00]: for other organisms that replace them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this changing of conditions,
this is favoring different organisms in
[SPEAKER_00]: that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, some type of trees need a lot
of sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their saplings can grow under the
shade of their own species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an important concept because trees
don't want to compete with their
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, if the tree needs a lot
of sun, your saplings can grow under
[SPEAKER_00]: shade, indicating when the parent species
is there, the parent specimen is there,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will not be competing with its
offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, they'll be replaced by types of
trees whose saplings can grow under the
[SPEAKER_00]: shade of other trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, again, helping determine what
kind of species will be living there and
[SPEAKER_00]: how this succession occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at an example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have an example of a succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: So primary succession occurs where there
is no previous community such as bare rock
[SPEAKER_00]: or sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Primary succession begins with pioneer
organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this primary is referring to bare rock
or sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically nothing was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of flow would be an example of
primary succession, where this newly
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed bare rock, we're starting at
primary succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: These primary organisms can tell you
extreme conditions, extremely hot or
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moss, dune grass, and lichens are pioneer
organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are some examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil is produced over hundreds of years by
these pioneer organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: These organisms break apart rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can die and decompose and hold water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these can allow other organisms to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see this kind of old rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see some lichens growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are algae and or cyanobacteria and a
fungus grown together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in a mutualistic relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: The algae make the food, because they're
able to capture the sunlight, and fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: anchor and capture water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a semi-acid relationship there
with those lichens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now secondary succession is when a
community is disrupted and succession
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this disruption could be from fire,
could be from farming, from foresting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part here is the community begins
again where a former community was
[SPEAKER_00]: disrupted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already a community here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being disrupted, it's being reformed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part for secondary succession is
the presence of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if soil is already present,
and we see in these three cases it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is an example of secondary
succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, primary starts with bare rock or
sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now climax community is the final stage of
succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same climax community will develop
unless abiotic conditions have changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Climax community will be part of the biome
of the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our climax community and in Connecticut
here, Old Hickory Forest, which is part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperate deciduous forest biome,
is considered a climax community.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where old forests will end up with
a high presence of oak and hickory trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now community is still undergoing
succession, so we see the recent 1960s and
[SPEAKER_00]: 1990s and projected here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that there's this transition,
this increase in these oak-hickory type
[SPEAKER_00]: forests increasing over the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This map shows the current projected
forest types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Major changes are predicted for many
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the big difference here and those
maple, beech, and birch trees becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: less predominant, or at least that's
what's projected in the year 27 to the
[SPEAKER_00]: year 2100.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the species keeps changing,
here the plants grown under pine trees are
[SPEAKER_00]: not small pine trees, so the species will
be changing as old pine trees fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't see the same species under the
original.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are noticing a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a climax community has been reached
when the community replaces itself with
[SPEAKER_00]: more of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well under sugar maple trees we will see
more sugar maple tree saplings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an indication that we've reached the
climax community because the original
[SPEAKER_00]: specimen is being replaced with the same
type.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not seeing different species under
there that will replace that in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the conditions that show a
climax community, which is the very end of
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological succession for a given area.
