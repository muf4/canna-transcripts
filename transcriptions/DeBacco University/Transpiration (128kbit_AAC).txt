[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this video lecture is going to focus
on the process of transpiration,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is basically water movement through
a plant in the roots through the stem and
[SPEAKER_00]: out the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important for many aspects of the
plant, one in particular cooling as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as moving nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at the transpiration
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have water movement in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the vascular plants have
conducting systems for transporting fluids
[SPEAKER_00]: and nutrients through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water and minerals enter through the roots
and are transported in the xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the xylem pictured here on the
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbohydrates are synthesized by the
photosynthetic process and are transported
[SPEAKER_00]: through the plant in the phloem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that on the right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These little red circles represent the
sucrose or sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that the water or xylem goes
from the bottom of the plant towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phloem in this instance is kind of moving
downwards, but it can move anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phloem is able to go up or down the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Xylem is going mainly from the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the shoots as we call it from the
bottom all the way up and through the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in that one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the flow of minerals in and out and
within the plant we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is passively transported into the
roots that enters the xylem and we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: that here at picture number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we look here in the stem region,
the forces of cohesion and adhesion cause
[SPEAKER_00]: water molecules to form in a column of
xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are little water molecules and this
is looking at the xylem that's in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And number three here, the water moves
from the xylem to the mesophil cells
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporating from their surfaces and leaves
to the plant by diffusion through the
[SPEAKER_00]: stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it's going to leave as water
vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this whole process is case repeating.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why you have to constantly water
your house plants, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're constantly going through
this transpiration process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now root pressure, several factors are at
work to move water up the height of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see water entering here at the
root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the very fine areas and that's
where water is going to be coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The initial movement of water into roots
involves osmosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And water moves into the cells of the root
because the fluid in the xylem contains
[SPEAKER_00]: more solutes than its surroundings.
[SPEAKER_00]: These solutes in the cell here are more
densely packed with, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: sugars and nutrients and ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That water through osmosis is naturally
going to want to move into those root
[SPEAKER_00]: hairs, ultimately entering the xylem and
moving up through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This osmotic force is called root
pressure, but by itself it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficient to push the water up the plant
stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kind of see another example here of
the water surrounding the soil particles
[SPEAKER_00]: entering the root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately working its way into the xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to it than just this to
create a sufficient root pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the solute potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since represented by this symbol here,
the solute potential is called the osmotic
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water moves in response to the difference
in water potential between the two
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, the left and right sides of the
tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a perfectly balanced system,
we see the water at the same height on the
[SPEAKER_00]: left and the right of the tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is a difference in water
potential, water will move from the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plant's root cells via the process
of osmosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here we have some solutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is naturally going to want to move
towards those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to want to try to dilute
those solutes through this semi-permeable
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why solute potential is sometimes
called osmotic potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's other ways we could add
positive pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we add pressure, we could force water
to kind of move and increase this side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we create a suction effect or a
negative pressure, we could draw water
[SPEAKER_00]: going this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, pure water can be even,
but here's just a kind of a passive
[SPEAKER_00]: example of by adding solutes to a
semi-permeable membrane, the osmotic flow
[SPEAKER_00]: of that water is going to shift to one
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is occurring also in the help of
capillary action.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to root pressure,
capillary action adds to the pull,
[SPEAKER_00]: put that in quotes there, to the moon of
water up the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of not a physical like pull as
you think, like a pull of a magnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what capillary action is doing is it's
to result from tiny electrical attractions
[SPEAKER_00]: of polar water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at capillary action,
here we see a red liquid and we see
[SPEAKER_00]: different diameter tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the diameter of the tube is getting
smaller, we're noticing that the ability
[SPEAKER_00]: for that red liquid to travel up the tube
is increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that here we have our gradual
increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: As that gets smaller and finer,
it's able to fight the force of gravity
[SPEAKER_00]: and overcome that force to a greater
extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This capillary action is not strong enough
to help pull water up the stem,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is again, all these factors are
coming together, helping the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capillary action depends a lot on the
radius of the tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see again, those smaller
radius having the greatest degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to resist the force of gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: A denser fluid in the same tube rises to a
smaller height than other factors being
[SPEAKER_00]: equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're seeing a more dense material
and a less dense of equal diameter and how
[SPEAKER_00]: that affects the degree of capillary
action.
[SPEAKER_00]: This adhesion and cohesion that I
mentioned, keep in mind that cohesion is
[SPEAKER_00]: like molecules sticking together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the two water molecules sticking
together, two water molecules sticking
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the hydrogen bonds,
it's cohesive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In adhesion, dissimilar molecules are
sticking together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water will interact and is charged with
polar molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have the polarity of the water
adhering or sticking to the outside
[SPEAKER_00]: surface here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be the water to the surface of
a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be water to the interior parts of
the xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that kind of water attaching or
adhering, think of like a piece of tape,
[SPEAKER_00]: tape adhering to the wall, adhering to the
desk, sticking to something other than
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this transpiration, how does this kind
of relate to this final transpiration
[SPEAKER_00]: process?
[SPEAKER_00]: The final pulse, the process of moving
water up the plant shoot is this
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water evaporating from the tops of the
leaves is the tube that pulls the column
[SPEAKER_00]: of water through the bottom roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The column of water does not collapse
because water molecules are attracted to
[SPEAKER_00]: each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the process again called cohesion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The narrower the diameter of the tube,
the more tensile strength that will occur
[SPEAKER_00]: or resistance to separation of the water
column.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help again move that water up
through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That transpiration by which the plant is
leaving the plant leaf in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more than 90% of the water taken in by
the plant is lost to the atmosphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly through the leaves and specifically
through the stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves, the pores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water first passes into the pockets of air
in the spongy mesophil and then evaporates
[SPEAKER_00]: out the stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: High humidity and low temperatures
decrease the rates of transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because we're talking a biological
system, there are factors that do impact
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The transpiration process in general,
looking at kind of a nice image here at a
[SPEAKER_00]: tree and this would be true for even
houseplants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cohesion and tenation theory of sap
ascent is shown where we again having that
[SPEAKER_00]: water coming through the root here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really fine areas and then
entering the xylem and then working its
[SPEAKER_00]: way with cohesive and adhesive properties,
drawing water up through the xylem,
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately reaching to the leaves,
ultimately reaching to the mesophil cells
[SPEAKER_00]: and then ultimately leaving out the
stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: So evaporation from the mesophil cells
produces a negative water potential
[SPEAKER_00]: gradient that causes water to move upward
through the roots and ultimately through
[SPEAKER_00]: the xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see that while the root cells
are a negative pressure, there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: greater negativity of the atmosphere and
the leaf tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this in relation here because this is
more negative, water is being pulled in
[SPEAKER_00]: that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The atmosphere is very negative and
ultimately that's why it's going out the
[SPEAKER_00]: stomata and that's why the stomata are
regulated to help reduce the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: water loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now impacts on the transpiration rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature, as you see as we increase
temperature, the rate of transpiration
[SPEAKER_00]: will increase and then plateau to a
certain point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wind velocity, as the wind velocity keeps
increasing, so does the rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of an opposite effect is
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you increase the humidity, as you
increase the moisture that's in the air,
[SPEAKER_00]: the rate of transpiration will actually
inverse or decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's more water in the air,
it's harder for that water to evaporate
[SPEAKER_00]: and therefore the rate of transpiration
will decrease for that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the stomata, as I mentioned,
is regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: When guard cells are plump and swollen,
they're said to be turgid and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be having that stomata be open as
we can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When those kind of lose their water,
they'll kind of collapse and collapse and
[SPEAKER_00]: close on themselves and this is allowing
the plant to reduce the amount of water
[SPEAKER_00]: loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see again here where there's
certain environmental stresses that can
[SPEAKER_00]: relate to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be hormones that can affect
that, but when those cells are nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: swollen, they're open allowing for water
exchange and then when that water is lost,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Balance between water and air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a plant is open their stomata,
they can breathe and exchange carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide and oxygen, which is what they
need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when the stomata are open,
the plant is also losing water and runs
[SPEAKER_00]: the risk of dehydrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why plants want to be
regulating this process because they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to maintain a high degree of turgid
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they leave their stomata open for
too long, though you can wilt and die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why they're constantly
regulating this to a certain point that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't water the plant that's in the
container, it's ultimately going to wither
[SPEAKER_00]: away and sadly perish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do provide plants with the right
amount of water, they can regulate fine
[SPEAKER_00]: and grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not, they're going to go
through a wilting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't want them for an extended
period of time and they do need the water,
[SPEAKER_00]: they ultimately will burn and die due to
dehydration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water your plants.
