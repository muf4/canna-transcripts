[SPEAKER_00]: So this video in Tobacco University,
I'm going to go over how to germinate
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the proper method or things some
do's some don'ts here on Tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the information
here on how to best germinate your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, keep in mind that seeds are dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seeds are nature's way for offspring to
wait for ideal conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: to take place before initiating the growth
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis seeds typically only have about
9% moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically sun drying is practiced or as
low as 5% or even less while dormant with
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lower that moisture content,
the longer you're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate those or keep them stored and
still have high germination numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the germination process of a seed,
there's a lot that goes on when a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: initiates the germination process.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, absorption of water stimulates
the germination process, the initiator to
[SPEAKER_00]: the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: The embryo will synthesize gibberellin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a plant hormone in response to water
uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a protein layer that synthesizes
amylase, which is an enzyme in response to
[SPEAKER_00]: the gibberellin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes people will hear people
adding gibberellic acid for older seeds to
[SPEAKER_00]: help encourage the germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a sense, they're trying to push that
step along that would normally be
[SPEAKER_00]: initiated by the water and kind of cause
this cascading event to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amylase mobilizes energy reserves and
hydrolyzes starch to maltose, means it
[SPEAKER_00]: breaks it apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maltose is converted to glucose and
respired to release ATP, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: energy source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that initial energy source,
it's going to cause the kind of formation
[SPEAKER_00]: and pushing out of the radical or root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the shoot is going to grow up or
in the upward direction to help it break
[SPEAKER_00]: through the soil to start to absorb the
sun there and produce its own sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So consistency is important when we're
looking at germinating seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be mindful of the conditions we
have our plants growing in and try to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: them as consistent as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the environmental conditions ranges
are determined, it's critical they're
[SPEAKER_00]: maintained for the duration of germination
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can always be exactly the same,
but as long as we know the range,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not exceeding that above or below.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help vastly increase your
consistency and your percent germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, you want to start with quality
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the start for any chance that a
good germination or emergence rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting seeds from a source that also
provides a COA, certificate of
[SPEAKER_00]: authenticity, can be well worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important for knowing what seeds
that you're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could also stand for certificate of
analysis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that while this image right
here shows a nice seed pack, this is not
[SPEAKER_00]: an official form of documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This over here, this kind of black and
white kind of simulant boring one can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: more official form of documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any person you're purchasing or
company you're purchasing seeds from
[SPEAKER_00]: should be able to supply with that upon
request.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the temperature, you're looking at
what should you germinate your seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: what temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Above 90 degrees Fahrenheit or above 30
degrees Celsius will kill the seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: will render them basically denature the
proteins and basically kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the ideal germination
temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at generally that 78
degrees Fahrenheit to 82 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit, 25 to 28 degrees Celsius is a
good starting point there that will allow
[SPEAKER_00]: for efficient or hopefully high
germination rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the moisture level, you're looking at
about a 90% relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be achieved in many ways,
with misters or humidity domes or even
[SPEAKER_00]: just plastic bags over little cups here
for seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also very important here to
maintain a very high relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind seeds also need to breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember they're respiring,
they're taking in oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there should be some air pockets no
matter what substrate you're using to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent seeds from drowning in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want them constantly soaking in
water and basically drowning in water we
[SPEAKER_00]: do want them to have at least 10% air to
allow that respiration process to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now planting depth can vary slightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically looking at an eighth to a
quarter of an inch which is about three
[SPEAKER_00]: millimeters to six millimeters deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many different ways to measure the key is
consistency and having a tool to speed up
[SPEAKER_00]: the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here can be a little dowel with just a
little marker on it to know exactly how
[SPEAKER_00]: far to place that seed down in the
germination media that you're choosing to
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for light for seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doesn't matter to say the light source
but we're looking at kind of what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the PAR reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically 150 to 300 micromoles is what's
suggested and remember PPFD stands for
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic photon flux density.
[SPEAKER_00]: PAR is typically what might be heard of in
the literature and that's photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: active radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: While not needed for the germination
process, it's good idea to have this light
[SPEAKER_00]: source over the plants upon emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seedlings can immediately start the
photosynthetic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see that emerges and there's
no light and then they can start
[SPEAKER_00]: stretching and causing other issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the light diffused to avoid burning
newly emerged seedlings and then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly work its way up especially if
you're going to an outdoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some growers recommend or talk about
well should I be soaking my seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I take my seeds and kind of like
put them in water for a duration of time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well for the most part some growers will
put seeds in the water before that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know for a predetermined soak time others
will go straight and to planting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A short soak and let's say short two to
maybe four hours is a good idea as this
[SPEAKER_00]: will help water infiltration and also
allow the growers to cull out seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: float that might not be fully developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Floating seeds often have those air
pockets in there and a poorly developed
[SPEAKER_00]: endosperm which will directly reduce
germination or emergence rates so
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes it's a good idea to maybe soak
them for a little bit to see which ones
[SPEAKER_00]: flow which ones have that kind of hollow
appearance and cull those out very early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now plain water or treated water is often
the growers will ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds should just be soaked in clean just
regular water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to add fertilizers even if
small amounts there's no need to the
[SPEAKER_00]: soaking water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone may add kelp to help provide a
small amount of hormones if older or
[SPEAKER_00]: poorly stored seedlings seeds are being
used but again even that necessary isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary just plain water is all the
seeds need to initiate this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the summary of those cannabis seed
germination processes always start with
[SPEAKER_00]: quality seeds out of a COA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again the temperature the humidity or
moisture levels I should say the air
[SPEAKER_00]: should be about 10% air the planting depth
the light and water should be filtered or
[SPEAKER_00]: at least drinkable water there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I recommend you don't do or try
to avoid is starting your seeds in paper
[SPEAKER_00]: towels to start the seeds for later
transfer into whatever media.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a poor idea due to the increased
likelihood of damage as a fragile radical
[SPEAKER_00]: it can get caught in the paper towel you
might miss them they're very small seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: they're very fragile seeds it's just
something that is not advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe from germinating larger seeds
potentially but definitely for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds not really advised to start in paper
towel even though many growers do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do recommend is I'll show here in a
short video clip is kind of what you would
[SPEAKER_00]: see kind of at a large scale a tray system
using Oasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're looking at a bowl of quality
cannabis seeds or that nice dark
[SPEAKER_00]: coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the area all set up you see
the trays we see the Oasis we see the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dibble we see a fan to keep the planter
happy and this is a great way to be
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient with this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright as we saw there kind of at the
large scale once you go through that
[SPEAKER_00]: process well how long will it take?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well germination typically you're looking
at two to seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emergence can be expected about three to
ten days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality seeds in conditions and this
stated range will fall in the lower end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the expected range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's just an example of a collection
of seedlings here 15 days from the initial
[SPEAKER_00]: seed soaking time and this just again
shows you what you can hopefully expect to
[SPEAKER_00]: see in that three to ten days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now where will you germinate your seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you be using you know while general
germination process is the same what do
[SPEAKER_00]: you intend to place the seeds in and
different substrates will have different
[SPEAKER_00]: specifics that you should be following.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example rockwool is favorable for
seed germination but disposal of that
[SPEAKER_00]: material can be an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soilless media is easy to get but can be
very messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Direct seedling requires no need for
transplant but needs specialized equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly going into a field or soil
based area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when looking at these options when
you're considering germinating seeds which
[SPEAKER_00]: growing substrate would you select?
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter which one you select search for
that video on this channel and you'll find
[SPEAKER_00]: more details for your selected growing
media to help increase your odds of
[SPEAKER_00]: success with your cannabis seedlings.
