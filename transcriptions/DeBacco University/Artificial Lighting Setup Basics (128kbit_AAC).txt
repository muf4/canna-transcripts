[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here I want to go over artificial
lighting setup basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy for growers to go out and
buy a bunch of lights and then worry about
[SPEAKER_00]: setting them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be thinking about your grow
room or your grow space and look at it
[SPEAKER_00]: realistically and then buy lights that
match that particular setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, planning your lighting
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, all lights generate some form of
heat so you should have an idea about how
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to manage this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basics should be taking into consideration
our distance to your plants, distance
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to put those lights from your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also distance from the ceiling,
method of cooling and capacity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: circuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of have these competing ideas
if you want to light the area but you have
[SPEAKER_00]: this heat to contend with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of becomes this little chess match of
how you're going to organize things and
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to make sure it's organized ahead
of time so you're not fumbling around with
[SPEAKER_00]: all these potentially very expensive
lights in a system that will not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So distance from plants and distance from
the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on the stage of growth and
type of light, the recommended distance
[SPEAKER_00]: will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you're using fluorescent
lights, you're looking about three to six
[SPEAKER_00]: inch distance between the plants and the
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: High pressure sodiums or your other high
intensity lights, looking at two feet or
[SPEAKER_00]: greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also want to consider the distance from
the ceiling as this has to do with the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to cool the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in this grow facility here,
there's a good distance to the ceiling
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing plenty of air circulation and
ability to cool the area very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: The method of cooling that you choose,
because lights can generate heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: should also consider a method of cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be potentially passive but usually
assisted in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all serve the same purpose but will
depend on the basics of the growing space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fan assisted is probably the most
common.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here's a can filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's able to really circulate the air well
and also purify and clean the air while
[SPEAKER_00]: it's also circulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also want to be thinking about the system
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy just to add lights but be
sure your system can support the power
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the total circuit and support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connect up to 80% of what can be supported
by the stated value of that circuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if everything on that circuit is not
running at the same time, consider it the
[SPEAKER_00]: worst case scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also hopefully using a breaker box kind of
system here and that kind of the old knob
[SPEAKER_00]: and tube infuses here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to upgrade to kind of a modern
day electrical box here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help reduce the chance of fire and allow
you to spread things out much more
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wire gauge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the higher the number, the smaller the
wire diameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here 30 gauge, 29 gauge,
28 gauge.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we get to 10 gauge, much larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four gauge, two gauge, one gauge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little counterintuitive that
larger number is that smaller wire gauge.
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 is often considered a standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you're doing a long run with
high power consumption, 12 gauge or a
[SPEAKER_00]: lower wire would be recommended to reduce
the chance of fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: The importance of a grounding plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at the sample between
this plug and this plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire electrical system should have a
grounding plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your outlets can only accept a
two-pronged electrical device,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are highly recommended to upgrade your
system here to include a grounding plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: These kind of would be the updated system
instead of the older system here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both running at the same voltage,
but the grounding plug is much advised
[SPEAKER_00]: because of that ground that is present to
help again make your system as safe as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, you want to make sure your proper
locally seating the bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take care to ensure the system is often
unplugged and take extra steps for good
[SPEAKER_00]: electrical connection, both with the
ballast and also at the bulb connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you could see here that
they'll fit in, but you want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: they're seated properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also want to clean the bulb and reflect it
before turning it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure everything checks out before
adding power and turning this on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have the safest and most efficient
way to light your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
