[SPEAKER_00]: Now a threat with any using of any
herbicides is the potential for drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well here we're going to see some images
of what some common herbicide drift damage
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like on hemp plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this tobacco university video
where we're going to look at herbicide
[SPEAKER_00]: damage symptoms on hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off there is this great reference
article and you're welcome to take a look
[SPEAKER_00]: at it from the University of California
and they look at herbicide damage symptoms
[SPEAKER_00]: on hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll provide the link here and they go
through more herbicides that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: cover here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to pick out some of the very
common ones that might be utilized that
[SPEAKER_00]: you might see or be familiar with but this
article has even more resources if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to take a look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off looking at herbicides in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well here's the active ingredients and
trade names.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people kind of focus on the trade
names but looking at that active
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient is important understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also common registered uses at least in
California at the time that this data was
[SPEAKER_00]: pulled just to give you an idea probably
the most famous one is Roundup and the
[SPEAKER_00]: active ingredient is glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll also be looking at a couple more
kind of listed more by their active
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient so compared to this list here
you might be familiar with the trade name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now glyphosate as I mentioned that first
one there typically you know Roundup it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a post emergent herbicide meaning the
weeds need to emerge before you spray them
[SPEAKER_00]: and it affects the meristematic regions
likely damaged by drift on the hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to look for chlorosis which is a
yellowing that can progress to browning
[SPEAKER_00]: over five to ten days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a slow progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that evident here where it's a
little lighter in that yellow coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it's a little bit more evident here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be clear signs of glyphosate
drift that may have occurred on your hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also have a paraquat here and this
is another post emergent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see you have an example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a group D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acts rapidly within hours and drift can
appear as droplets browning necrosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of get that little like
speckling effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now of course if it occurs in a larger
degree we'll get browning of the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf but sometimes evident is that little
like speckling that might occur and that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be an indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting some spray drift from
this particular herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have glyphosinate which is injury
often a function of concentration as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common trade name would be X out if you're
familiar with that type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typical symptoms initially occur within a
few days beginning with wilting and
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorosis and progressing to necrotic
tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a little more aggressive of
that kind of spotting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little more aggressive spread and again
this occurs typically a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again the evidence that this herbicide
might have been drifted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then propanil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that one right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Injury is usually first observed in the
older fully formed leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's again an important distinction
to make here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the older leaf damage not
necessarily the meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Injuries often initially noted at the leaf
margins as just the edges of the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: and then moves further into the
interveinal areas of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of starts at the margins and works
its way in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant survives of this foliar
exposure newly formed leaves may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one that the plant can
potentially grow out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is this herbicide typically used?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well typically used for barnyard grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have those in your particular
area might be spraying this at a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be evident of what drift to be
on the lookout for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly mentioned here synthetic
auxins and there's different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the whole plant level this abnormal
growth can take the form of leaf and stem
[SPEAKER_00]: twisting, cupping, bending, cracking,
sometimes curling may occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see kind of the evidence here of
the plant just kind of like gets a little
[SPEAKER_00]: funky look to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again just because you see leaf curling
doesn't always mean it's herbicide that
[SPEAKER_00]: was applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you know one of these has been
applied in the area particularly 2,4-D
[SPEAKER_00]: very known for its drifting abilities and
you see this curling that's an indication
[SPEAKER_00]: to maybe getting some of that herbicide
drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just things to be cautious for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just wanted to provide you with this
kind of comparison here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are choosing the herbicide route to
be mindful of what product you'll be using
[SPEAKER_00]: and to be mindful of what those symptoms
may look on hemp plants to be aware if you
[SPEAKER_00]: if drift is occurring after your
application.
