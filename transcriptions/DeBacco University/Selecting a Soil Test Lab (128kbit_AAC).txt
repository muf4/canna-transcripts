[SPEAKER_00]: Here on this Tobacco University video,
I'm going to provide you with some insight
[SPEAKER_00]: into selecting a soil test lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking to get your soil
tested, that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at different soil labs,
here I'm going to provide you with some
[SPEAKER_00]: information about some of the options
available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, when we're talking about
soil testing the labs in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's two common extraction solutions
that are used, and this is something you
[SPEAKER_00]: should find out what the lab is utilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is a modified Morgan extract,
and that's a weak acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one is called the malec-3 extract,
and that's a strong acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're comparing labs and they're
using different extraction fluids,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may be getting slightly different
results, just as a word of caution.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are both universal extraction
procedures, meaning they're used to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine all major nutrients and many of
the micronutrients simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we can see the malec-3 phosphorescent
parts per million versus the Morgan P
[SPEAKER_00]: parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we see a little correlation there
comparing those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times with phosphorus,
the lab will state which extraction fluid
[SPEAKER_00]: it's using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what are some options?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's university labs,
and state universities provide a reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: soil testing service through their
cooperative extension service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often both soil testing and fertilizer and
amendment recommendations for the intended
[SPEAKER_00]: crop are provided with university labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can be subject to funding cuts or
labor shortages, which can result in
[SPEAKER_00]: longer durations to get the results back
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a word of caution there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might want to check with the lab ahead
of time to see what their anticipated time
[SPEAKER_00]: upon receiving the soil is to the time
they're generating the report.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's also commercial labs as
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tend to favor large-scale growers
and are a volume-driven business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to university-based labs,
the cost per sample is often greater,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this doesn't mean the results are
necessarily, quote-unquote, better.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, results are often in the growers'
hands quicker, so when time is money,
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial labs can be the preferred
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we're deciding as far as what lab
to utilize, well, growers will typically
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize the same lab for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is good practice, as this is a way
growers can become familiar with the units
[SPEAKER_00]: and will have the same extraction
procedure performed to help allow for easy
[SPEAKER_00]: comparisons between fields and also
year-to-year of the same field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be taking soil reports or soil
tests over multiple years using the same
[SPEAKER_00]: lab that will allow an even comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now no matter what lab that you choose,
realize that springtime is typically the
[SPEAKER_00]: busiest season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is when you are most likely to
have results delays, meaning when you send
[SPEAKER_00]: your results in, don't expect them back
next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the lab is only as good as the
sample you send them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't matter necessarily what lab
you choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are not well versed in sending a
proper field representative soil sample to
[SPEAKER_00]: the lab, the results they give you can
only be as good as the sample you send
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind and make sure you're
taking the proper procedures to send
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever lab you choose a quality result,
so you will get quality results in return.
