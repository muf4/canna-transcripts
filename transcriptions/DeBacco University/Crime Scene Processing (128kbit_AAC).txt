[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, in this video on DeBaca University,
we're going to be looking at crime scene
[SPEAKER_00]: processing, or at least a general overview
of how you would process a crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the processing scene main
objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first is always safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be sure of maintaining safe
conditions, no matter what the scene is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to vary depending on what
scene you may approach, or what scene you
[SPEAKER_00]: might be investigating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the degree of knowledge of your
understanding of what's going on at the
[SPEAKER_00]: scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless, you want to make sure you're
securing the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, you might want to be
keeping a safer distance if we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, here a car on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you want to prevent people from
entering or exiting a scene, because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to include just more
variability potentially for the data that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to collect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to maintain that protection of
the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to secure it, but you also
want to have someone kind of out looking
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure no one is unwillingly
entering that scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your next job should be to go through and
photographing, to look at documenting the
[SPEAKER_00]: scene with images, making a sketch,
particularly if we're talking a scene
[SPEAKER_00]: where there might be a body located.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be sure you're taking notes,
taking pretty detailed notes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collecting, labeling, and packaging any
evidence you come across, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately you'll be writing a report for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at that safety in
particular, that safety being first,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at each scene is unique,
so be attentive and keep in mind of your
[SPEAKER_00]: own scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, such as glass and sharp
objects, but there can also be trip
[SPEAKER_00]: hazards, unstable objects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you're not sure exactly what you're
entering, so always make sure you're
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining your own security and safety
so you don't become a part of the scene
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you want to secure that crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, the first officer at the
crime scene is responsible for securing
[SPEAKER_00]: and protecting the area using the crime
scene tape and other physical barriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The victim is alive, medics should be
called, and they would be allowed to enter
[SPEAKER_00]: the scene, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is not to compromise the evidence
in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you're securing and locking
down that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the witnesses are present, make sure
they do not leave the scene, because you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to get their report before they go
off and are lost potentially, because they
[SPEAKER_00]: could be great sources of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're protecting that scene,
this is a very important step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who enters the scene has the
potential to destroy physical evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often damage should be unintentional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind that someone might be
entering the scene to intentionally do
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, but unintentionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do a lot of damage to the
evidence collection process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone should be excluded from the
scene, including police officers not
[SPEAKER_00]: directly involved in the process of the
site or investigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That investigator, that main crime scene
investigator, has only a limited amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: time to work and must complete the
following of the crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Must be taking photographs, providing a
sketch, making notes, collecting document
[SPEAKER_00]: and packaging evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot to do, and it always seems
like there's never enough time to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're taking photographs,
you want to make sure that they're of the
[SPEAKER_00]: unaltered scene, because objects must
remain untouched until photographed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If evidence has been removed or moved,
it must be mentioned in the actual report.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just have that kind of having
moving things and then assuming that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where it was originally found,
that should be evidence and noted in the
[SPEAKER_00]: report process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any proof of the crime scene was
compromised would cause the evidence to be
[SPEAKER_00]: admissible in court.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the main thing you're trying
to protect and make sure all the evidence
[SPEAKER_00]: you're collecting is able to be used in
court.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, crime scene photography basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the basics for photography,
there are other videos mentioning them in
[SPEAKER_00]: more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Investigators should be thought of taking
care of photographs in all areas where the
[SPEAKER_00]: crime took place and likely entry and exit
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember to include different angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see here in the images
included, we see the Eiffel Tower
[SPEAKER_00]: presented at different angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to have establishing medium
range close up and macroscopic
[SPEAKER_00]: photographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in learning more
about those, there's a specific video on
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All images should include a ruler as a
side reference to help establish the
[SPEAKER_00]: general size of the objects that's being
documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the sketch basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after photographs are taken,
a sketch of the crime scene should be
[SPEAKER_00]: generated on a scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: A rough sketch will be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: After leaving the scene, part of the
processing phase is developing a finished
[SPEAKER_00]: or final sketch that has precise
recreation of the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But while you're there, you at least want
to get a rough sketch in.
[SPEAKER_00]: All sketches, remember, will need a legend
showing where certain items of the crime
[SPEAKER_00]: scene are located and also indicating
where north is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure you include that in all sketches.
[SPEAKER_00]: General requirements looking at sketches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, of course, you need to have a title,
a legend for any abbreviations or symbols
[SPEAKER_00]: that are used, a compass direction showing
at least the northern direction,
[SPEAKER_00]: a scale and documentation with at least
location, date and time, and the creator's
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure these are also present in any
sketches created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some just general sketch examples
just to give you an idea of the legend and
[SPEAKER_00]: how things may be oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always want to be sure that you're
documenting some of the important pieces
[SPEAKER_00]: of evidence that might be found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Entry points, exit points, distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all very important things to
be documenting and including on the sketch
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, remember, we should be taking notes
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these notes should include the
location of the crime scene, the date and
[SPEAKER_00]: time of notification and information
received and who it was from, the time of
[SPEAKER_00]: your arrival and your departure,
scene details, which will be more on the
[SPEAKER_00]: next slide, and a description of the
victim and names of the investigation
[SPEAKER_00]: team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: To kind of take in in a very short period
of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why having an idea what you
need to include and making sure you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting all this in a relatively efficient
manner is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lastly, looking here at the detailed
description of the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in this example, we're looking at
this is of particular importance for
[SPEAKER_00]: physical evidence at the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for each item, the following should be
documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure you're getting the
time of discovery, who discovered it,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it was packaged and labeled in a
description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of that item, because these will likely be
need to refer to as further investigations
[SPEAKER_00]: are being conducted to better tell the
story of what happened at the crime scene.
