[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to go over a gene editing
technique getting a lot of popularity in
[SPEAKER_00]: the scientific community called CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CRISPR, the basics of it is that it's a
gene editing method that exists in living
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organisms that it exists in are it's a
simplified antiviral defense system found
[SPEAKER_00]: in bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientists have been able to identify this
and are now using this for gene editing of
[SPEAKER_00]: many different cells other than just
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: CRISPR allows for cells gene them to be
cut at predetermined locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very specific, which is probably the
reason why it's getting popularity and
[SPEAKER_00]: that will result in the removal or the
addition of specific genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's specific and it allows for
modification of the genes by either
[SPEAKER_00]: addition or removal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly
Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to highlight the words here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clustered is just kind of a grouping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regularly it's a defined pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interspace is just the distance between
objects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's small and short distances,
so it's looking for a very short sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Palindromic, that's a sequence that reads
the same backwards as it does forwards,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as mom or dad or something a little
more complex like race car.
[SPEAKER_00]: You spell the letters out forwards and
backwards, you'll get this same word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember though DNA will always read in
the five to three prime direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last letter R stands for repeats.
[SPEAKER_00]: This occurs again in the same form,
kind of like the post here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times you'll hear CRISPR
referred to as CRISPR Cas9.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why that is is that Cas9 is an
enzyme that can cut DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CRISPR Cas9, the complex allows for the
removal or addition of specific genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The possibility via Cas9 Nuclease,
remember those three letters, ACE,
[SPEAKER_00]: can imply an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a complex that's created with
guide RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Cas9 in this image is kind of like
the blue areas that you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guide RNA is kind of the green
areas here, and you'll see that through
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the other images in this
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guide RNA, this gRNA, guide RNA is
sequences that will bind to the DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence to be edited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often abbreviated guide RNA as g,
little g, RNA, or single guide RNA as
[SPEAKER_00]: gRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guide RNA is non-coding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a short RNA sequence that will bind
to the complementary DNA sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the double helix, double strand
of DNA here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here it's binding five to three prime.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sequence, which is the reason CRISPR
can be so specific, it's looking for these
[SPEAKER_00]: specific nucleotides.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guide RNA is encased and wrapped here
in the Cas9 enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the basic process of CRISPR is first
scientists have to identify target DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a genome that could be a gene that
needs modification, that could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, whatever gene is being identified
first by scientists, then it has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: identified so that guide RNA can be
created so that the complement of the DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence is very specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very short region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to identify the gene and then
make the complement RNA for the guide RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the guide RNA and the Cas9 are
attached to form this complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this complex will then be
inserted into target cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it goes through target cells,
it will go through and read the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we're reading that
chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once a sequence is found, the DNA will
be cleaved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a picture of a cleaver here or a
knife.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to cut that DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it cuts that DNA, that can allow for
the addition or deletion of nucleotides to
[SPEAKER_00]: occur at that specific region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the advantage of CRISPR, some of the
possibilities, it can silence genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can alter disease-causing genes into a
healthy one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's just kind of an example here of
some diseases that have been identified on
[SPEAKER_00]: different chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once they're identified, if we get the
sequence, CRISPR could possibly be used to
[SPEAKER_00]: alter the disease-causing gene into a
healthy one, not only to the benefit of
[SPEAKER_00]: the individual, but their offspring and
lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be used to specifically insert
a codon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a stop codon of a particular
amino acid into a sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also change or alter gene
expression, silence them or upregulating
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than editing genes, CRISPR can also
activate the transcription process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, transcription is DNA to RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: How that's done is through the
deactivation of the Cas9 cleaving
[SPEAKER_00]: abilities, meaning that in this case,
the Cas9 will not be able to break or cut
[SPEAKER_00]: in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just able to go through and
activate the transcription process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also repress or silence genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see as a repressor blocking
certain genes from being expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one here, adding a
fluorescent label to visually identify
[SPEAKER_00]: physical locations of DNA sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be important where we're
identifying and then it's going to add a
[SPEAKER_00]: little label.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can allow scientists to know the
physical location of certain genes so that
[SPEAKER_00]: they can aid in development of a 3D model
of the genome and tracking the chromosome
[SPEAKER_00]: movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another reason why this degree
of being able to specifically identify
[SPEAKER_00]: certain regions, here visually marking
them, can be advantageous to scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, we have to remember that when
we're modifying genes, there's also the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for social concern should human
genes be altered in somatic cells or
[SPEAKER_00]: embryos is a controversial issue,
no matter how it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: CRISPR is just kind of the latest
technology to offer this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if undetectable off-target effects
occur that have not been studied
[SPEAKER_00]: comprehensively?
[SPEAKER_00]: What potential negative impacts could that
have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this could change the human genome
through generation and after generation,
[SPEAKER_00]: even cause disastrous consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing about if you modify all the
genetics of a lineage or generation,
[SPEAKER_00]: now, even if you don't do it in the
future, those modifications will be passed
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these cause worries and include related
to mental health, social behaviors,
[SPEAKER_00]: designing human capabilities such as
intelligence, appearance, personality,
[SPEAKER_00]: vision, eye color, a whole bunch of
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's just social and ethical
concerns with this technology because it
[SPEAKER_00]: is genetic modification.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also been some research down over
in the UK that have shown and reported
[SPEAKER_00]: some unwanted results of CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while CRISPRs often used to generate
small deletions, as I've shown,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what it shows here,
scientists have seen unintended large
[SPEAKER_00]: deletions.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say large, we're talking several
thousand nucleotides long in addition to
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated DNA arrangements of distant
sequences being stitched together.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all things not intended,
but can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it must be mindful, especially when
we're looking at human gene editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This phenomenon was prevalent in all the
three types of cells tested, including a
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of human growth cell in the
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, something just warranting
caution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a relatively new technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to continue to be studied so we
don't have any of these unwanted edits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with CRISPR, one that's been used in a
positive note is what's called precision
[SPEAKER_00]: guided sterile insect technique,
kind of a long term there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Researchers have developed a new way to
control and suppress populations of
[SPEAKER_00]: insects, potentially including those that
ravage agricultural crops and transmit
[SPEAKER_00]: deadly diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insects can mass produce, they're very
r-selected species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by controlling their populations,
they can be advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of spraying a pesticide that could
kill all insects, this could be very
[SPEAKER_00]: targeted.
[SPEAKER_00]: The precision guided sterile insect
technique, the PGSIT, alters key genes
[SPEAKER_00]: that control insect sex determination and
fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how could this possibly be used to
control insect populations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we take these precision guided
sterile insect technique, what will happen
[SPEAKER_00]: is we'll take eggs and we'll introduce
into target populations where only adult
[SPEAKER_00]: sterile males will emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This results in a novel environmentally
friendly and relatively low cost method of
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling pest populations in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also very specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the screw worm fly was the first pest
successfully eliminated from an area
[SPEAKER_00]: through sterile insect technique by the
use of this integrated area wide approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not looking at spraying some sort
of chemical that may enter the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is using CRISPR to specifically
target this particular species of fly,
[SPEAKER_00]: create sterile males, and really reduce
and hopefully potentially eliminate them
[SPEAKER_00]: from the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, because this is such a new
technology, so it's looking at some
[SPEAKER_00]: sources here and also some additional
YouTube videos that you're welcome to take
[SPEAKER_00]: a look at if you're interested in learning
more about CRISPR.
