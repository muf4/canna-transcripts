[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at the path
that food takes to the stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's not this kind of nice,
even path in the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple interesting things that
do happen in how we get food to move down
[SPEAKER_00]: in a controlled manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to investigate that further
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, starting with the pharynx.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's colored here in purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the throat, as you may know it as.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's involved in both digestion and
respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is not dedicated only to the
digestive process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's receiving food and air from the
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here's again our oral cavity here and
the nasal cavity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, air is both coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: When food enters the pharynx, involuntary
muscles contractions close off the air
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we see our pharynx.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're closing off the air pathway to allow
food to go down the esophagus,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want food to go down this way
into the trachea because this is leading
[SPEAKER_00]: to our lungs and this could lead to
choking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we want, there's involuntary muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: When food enters, this will get closed off
so that our food can enter the esophagus
[SPEAKER_00]: and continue down its path towards the
stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the swallowing of a bolus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of swallowing, the tongue moves back
and forth in the mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see we're looking at that food
bolus here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soft palate will elevate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soft palate will elevate, pushing back
wall of the pharynx.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stimulates neurons to send impulses
to the swallowing center in the brain and
[SPEAKER_00]: muscles will contract and raise to
pharynx, you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, here's where we don't want the
food to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is leading ultimately to our lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The glottis, which is right here,
is pushed back against the epiglottis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which keeps food out of the respiratory
tract and in the esophagus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that occurring here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it's open here, allowing air to
come in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're closing that off to allow food
to continue down to the esophagus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, once it's passed, it can open
back up and we can breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, allowing our gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important this process occurs and
we close off that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you choke or get something,
you know, goes down the wrong pipe,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's literally where this term comes
from, because it's going down here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the trachea, instead of the esophagus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a zoomed-in version here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The epiglottis is a very important
structure here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's represented right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a flap of cartilage that covers
the windpipe during the swallowing,
[SPEAKER_00]: prevents food from entering the larynx.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want food to go down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're swallowing, those tongues
moving, the epiglottis is closing off
[SPEAKER_00]: here, allowing food to go down the
esophagus and not the trachea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the esophagus and the stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: The esophagus is a muscular tube that
connects the pharynx to the stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swallowing the center stimulates the
success of waves of contractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get that food to move down
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, peristalsis is the key we're seeing
in this image.
[SPEAKER_00]: It moves fluid along the esophagus to the
stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: This food is moving along in a very
controlled manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you may think, well, just gravity is
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, it's actually a controlled set
of muscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like squeezing a toothpaste
as you're working it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This way, if you were to be on your side
or even upside down in an extreme case,
[SPEAKER_00]: daily food would still move to the stomach
because of the muscle contractions that's
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the esophagus, its location,
it's a hollow muscular tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 10 inches long, about 2
centimeters or about 8 tenths of an inch
[SPEAKER_00]: wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It conveys solid food and lipids to the
stomach, ultimately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I put this image here so we can kind
of see where it's located in relation to
[SPEAKER_00]: the heart because, remember, there are
other organs involved here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it would be behind the heart
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be where our esophagus would be
located.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's behind the heart when we're
looking at the anatomical organization of
[SPEAKER_00]: all of our organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The movement of the digestive materials,
its muscular layers of digestive tract,
[SPEAKER_00]: its smooth muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This peristalsis is the key part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a rhythmic contraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's allowing that food to be pushed down
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It moves food through the digestive tract
also in alternating waves of muscle,
[SPEAKER_00]: contraction, relaxation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see that indicated here where
we have alternating contraction,
[SPEAKER_00]: relaxation, contraction, relaxation,
moving that food through the digestive
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be used here for mixing of
that food items.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we have the stomach and the gastric
glands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Movement of the food from the esophagus to
the stomach is controlled by a ring of
[SPEAKER_00]: smooth muscle called a sphincter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we see the sphincter is open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we have the sphincter closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans lack kind of a true sphincter and
thus can regurgitate food items.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was a true sphincter, it would not
allow that to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want this sphincter, though,
to be very functional because not only do
[SPEAKER_00]: we want food to be able to add to the
stomach, we don't want all the high
[SPEAKER_00]: stomach acid that we have here entering
our esophagus.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do have a failure of this sphincter,
that's how we get heartburn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the high amount of hydrogen ions,
still very low pH, the hydrochloric acid
[SPEAKER_00]: entering our very sensitive esophagus
causing that burning feeling on ourselves.
Thank you.
