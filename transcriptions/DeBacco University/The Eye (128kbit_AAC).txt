[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm looking at the eye,
and not just the human eye, but vision in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on that topic, what is vision?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, vision begins with the capture of
light energy by photoreceptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many invertebrates have simple visual
systems in the sense that their
[SPEAKER_00]: photoreceptors are clustered in an eye
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They perceive light's direction,
but not necessarily a visual image like
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here, a nice, very simple,
very basic to very complex development of
[SPEAKER_00]: the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's four phylum that have evolved
well-developed image-forming eyes,
[SPEAKER_00]: analids, mollusks, arthropods,
and vertebrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our flatworm that has just the eye
spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although they may look like very
distinctive eyes, they're simply only able
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell light from dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eyes are strikingly similar in structure,
but are believed to have different
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionary paths amongst all of these
phylum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eyes of animals, as we see here,
we have our insect eye, very basic,
[SPEAKER_00]: very large area of reception.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the human eye of the vertebrate
compared to the octopus.
[SPEAKER_00]: In initial inspection, if you look at both
of these, they look very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what's distinctly different is
the number four region.
[SPEAKER_00]: The four is the blind spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our eyes, we have an area within each
eye, very small, but it's a blind spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens here is there's lack of
photoreceptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in the octopus eye, there is no
blind spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The retina continues the entire way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And three is the optic nerve, and that's
what's sending all of this information of
[SPEAKER_00]: the image to the brain for processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on the structure of the
vertebrate eye, eye works like a
[SPEAKER_00]: lens-focused camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the cornea located here,
and that's a transparent covering that
[SPEAKER_00]: focuses light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then have the lens, which completes the
focusing, and ciliary muscles that change
[SPEAKER_00]: the shape of the lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're located here, and they can help
pull or kind of condense down that lens so
[SPEAKER_00]: that the image can be properly focused on
the back of the eye where the retina is
[SPEAKER_00]: located.
[SPEAKER_00]: The iris is a shutter that controls the
amount of light allowed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that evident here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pupil is a transparent zone located
directly in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: The retina is at the back surface of the
eye, and the retina contains two types of
[SPEAKER_00]: photoreceptors, both rods and cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The center of the retina, the fovara,
is what produces the sharpest image.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fovara is the area that's producing
that sharpest image.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want that focused on the back of the
eye, because that's what's going to allow
[SPEAKER_00]: the image to be perceived in its clearest
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, rods are very sensitive to dim light,
as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot distinguish colors,
nor can they detect edges of images.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce a poorly defined image.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to that, cones can detect
color, and they're able to detect edges
[SPEAKER_00]: well, and they help produce very sharp
images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rods and cones, both of these,
are located at the rear of the retina,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the front, because this is where our
image will be focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where our lens is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That image then gets projected in the
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, color vision, there's three kinds of
cones that exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each absorb different wavelengths of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our blue, our green, and our red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So despite only having three cones,
we're able to perceive many different
[SPEAKER_00]: colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these many different colors we're able
to perceive as a combination or a blending
[SPEAKER_00]: of what these cones are receiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: We set evident here with our red and our
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they mix together, they form yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you mix red, green, and blue,
we get that white light evident here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a combination of these, it shows kind
of the distinctive colors here,
[SPEAKER_00]: or how we're able to get these general
wavelengths of light, and this is how
[SPEAKER_00]: we're able to perceive all of these
variations of colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you didn't see any colors,
you might be color blind, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: condition where a person cannot see all
three colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's caused by a lack of one or more types
of cones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's inherited as a sex-linked trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more likely to affect males because
it's an ex-linked recessive inherited
[SPEAKER_00]: trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: One in 12 men will be infected on average,
and one in 200 women will be afflicted by
[SPEAKER_00]: color blindness.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see here, if you see just a bunch
of dots, you might be color blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see a 74 here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 74 was the number for this color
blind test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, continuing on with the eye,
we're focusing for distant vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking in the distance for things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light from a distance needs very little
adjusting for proper focusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Far point vision, the distance beyond
which the lens does not need to change
[SPEAKER_00]: shape to focus, is about 20 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Closer than 20 feet, we call that close
vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the closer source, the light is bent
more sharply by the relaxed lens to strike
[SPEAKER_00]: the retina.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see both of these striking the
distinctive back of the retina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, for distant vision, our lens is very
flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: For close vision, our muscles have
adjusted to cause that lens to be fatter,
[SPEAKER_00]: bending that light so that it directly
hits the back of our retina for a clear
[SPEAKER_00]: image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focusing for close vision, we have a
combination, which is to change the lens
[SPEAKER_00]: shape by silly muscles to decrease the
refractory power.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that fattening of the lens causing,
again, that focus point to be directly on
[SPEAKER_00]: the retina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Constriction is the papillary reflex
constricts the pupils to prevent divergent
[SPEAKER_00]: light rays from entering the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever had your eyes dilated after
going to the eye doctors, this is what it
[SPEAKER_00]: will look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pupils will dilate, and this is an eye
here that did not have pupil dilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Convergence is the medial rotation of the
eyeballs towards the object being viewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a distinctive case here
where this person is able to independently
[SPEAKER_00]: move one eye compared to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to focus on a close object,
both eyeballs are gonna converge to that
[SPEAKER_00]: midpoint there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Problems with refraction, so if you wear
glasses, this is important to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have normal eye vision,
that's with the light focused properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nearsighted myopic is the focal point is
in front of the retina.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here is evident of
nearsightedness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That focal point is in front of the
retina.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that when the image does hit
the retina, it's blurry.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you see here's a clear image,
and here's kind of the near objects being
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit better in focus and those
just slightly further away here,
[SPEAKER_00]: not having quite as distinctive kind of
sharpness to that image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farsightedness, the focal point is beyond
the retina and corrective lenses with a
[SPEAKER_00]: different type of lens we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you see focal points behind the
retina, we see that here, indicating the
[SPEAKER_00]: image here is still blurry.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are corrected farsightedness with a
convex lens, see here, and nearsightedness
[SPEAKER_00]: with a concave lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's adjusting so that in both cases
now, the focal point is directly on the
[SPEAKER_00]: retina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Types of lenses found in glasses,
there's a bunch of different types more
[SPEAKER_00]: than just for near and farsightedness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on your vision, you may have
multiple lenses in your glasses to help
[SPEAKER_00]: with both near and far focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bifocals, it's the name implies,
there's two different types of lenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one for far, typically located
towards the top of the lens, and near for
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trifocals, the name implies, there's
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a far, a middle, and a near.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also progressive lenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They change magnifying power near to the
middle to far vision gradually.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have these distinctive lines as
a trifocal or a bifocal would have.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, their purpose is the same to
help the individual see clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the image of Seattle being
refracted through myopic glasses there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Binocular vision, primates and most
predators have eyes in front of the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two fields of vision overlap,
allowing the perception of 3D images in
[SPEAKER_00]: depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prey animals generally have eyes located
on the sides of their head.
[SPEAKER_00]: This prevents binocular vision but
enlarges the perceptive field of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that here with our pigeon.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pigeons have a very large field of
view because they're often preyed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Owls are predators, and they have not
quite as large a field of view to more
[SPEAKER_00]: overlap, more of a blind spot we'll say,
because they're more focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two fields overlap a lot in
perception of 3D images in depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever want to try this, you take
both of your hands and put them out in
[SPEAKER_00]: front of you, and go through and touch the
tips of your fingers, but then if you
[SPEAKER_00]: close just one eye and try to do it,
you'll often miss because you lack that 3D
[SPEAKER_00]: depth perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, some animals, chameleons in
particular here, can move each eye
[SPEAKER_00]: independently, and this can allow for a
greater field of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can focus both eyes and select prey
before striking.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another kind of unique adaptation
that some animals have for independent eye
[SPEAKER_00]: movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this was helpful in giving you
that brief overview about the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
