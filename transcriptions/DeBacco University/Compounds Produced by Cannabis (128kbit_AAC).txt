[SPEAKER_00]: In this Debaco University video,
I'm going to go over some of the compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: produced by the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into some compounds
produced by cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, can't produce as many
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't cover them all here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to touch on some of the
major highlights because cannabis is a
[SPEAKER_00]: complex plant with over 500 chemical
entities.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than 100 of them are cannabinoid
compounds alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them actually have opposing
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though cannabis has been used and
cultivated by mankind for at least 6,000
[SPEAKER_00]: years, our current knowledge of its
pharmaceutical properties is based on
[SPEAKER_00]: studies which may have taken place only
since the end of the 19th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we have a lot more to learn
about this plant and some of the compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's producing and how they may best
be utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, start with some of the
physical structures, the trichomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we can see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the physical structures that
contain the cannabinoids, flavonoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while these chemicals are going to be
produced, or chemicals will be produced
[SPEAKER_00]: over the course of the plant, really it's
these trichomes, these structures here
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're going to be looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: These small, it looks like little white,
almost like sugar dots, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: These area right here, these trichomes,
that's where most of the cannabinoids that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking for for pharmaceutical
purposes are going to be produced in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the first one,
kind of the one probably most people
[SPEAKER_00]: associate with cannabis, and that's THC,
or tetrahydrocannabinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the psychoactive compound that
generates the marijuana, typically
[SPEAKER_00]: high-fueling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the greater percent THC, the more
potent the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC can also act as an appetite
suppressant with also some medical
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits, such as anti-anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of what the chemical
structure here looks like of
[SPEAKER_00]: tetrahydrocannabinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now CBD, something else you've probably
heard a lot about, cannabidiol,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how that's pronounced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to provide a pronunciation,
I should say, here so you can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: deconstruct these very long and complex
terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CBD is a non-psychoactive chemical
component, basically doesn't get you high,
[SPEAKER_00]: has many medical benefits, such as
suppressing seizures, pain relief,
[SPEAKER_00]: and improved sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often CBD extraction is used to make oils,
edibles, or topicals for different medical
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits, with also the ease of
application for the user, more so than
[SPEAKER_00]: just the dry flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can get to the THC compared or
versus CBD, and these are both
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids produced by cannabis,
and we could see here kind of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will, the original molecule,
CBGA, can then be, through the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: made into THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of growers were also looking at
CBG dominant varieties, so they could make
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever ratio that they deemed desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, though, plants with high THC
produce that strong euphoric high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also do fearings of anxiety as well
as dizziness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants with high CBDs lack that euphoric
high and have great medical benefits,
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for pain, inflammation,
epilepsy, as well as seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBD a lot, and especially younger
children, has been shown to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures, and that's what's hopefully
helped gain some popularity here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in addition to just those,
we have THCV, tetrahydrocannabinogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: which produces a trippy high that comes on
quick and is often associated with a
[SPEAKER_00]: caffeine rush because of its high energy
compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, keep in mind that THCV must reach
428 degrees Fahrenheit in order to be
[SPEAKER_00]: activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may help with blood sugar regulation as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you suffer from anxiety,
it would be advised to stay away from
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties that have elevated levels of
THCV, just a word of caution there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have CBN, which is cannabinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not well documented at the current time,
but shares some characteristics of CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: with less potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does show promise as a sleep aid,
and is typically found in low percentages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be professionally isolated
from the plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned before, one that gained
some popularity simply because it's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of that stem cell molecule of THC and CBD,
and it's pronounced cannabinogeral.
[SPEAKER_00]: This compound is gaining popularity since
it's the precursor to THC, CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as CBC, as well as some other
minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not present in high amounts because
it's quickly converted by the plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: other compounds, but it does show promise
to reduce inflammation, and also can be
[SPEAKER_00]: used as an antibacterial agent,
and along with some other medical
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often been referred to as the stem
cell of cannabis, and could serve as the
[SPEAKER_00]: building block for many compounds,
and this is why some growers get really
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in breeding this, simply
because it's that starting point,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's that early point that then,
if they had a lot of that, they could then
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out these different synthases and
produce the ratios of compounds they want
[SPEAKER_00]: it in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So terpenes are aromatic organic
compounds, which are typically oils that
[SPEAKER_00]: are increased in the trichomes of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They naturally occur in plants to reduce
herbivore feeding and increase odds of
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: These compounds produce the unique
flavors, colors, and smells of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but of course, are not limited to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, pine sap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably familiar with that aroma
associated with pine trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an example of another plant
producing these terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, we have flavonoids here,
and these are a group of natural
[SPEAKER_00]: substances with variable phenolic
structures, and are found in fruits,
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables, grains, bark, roots,
stems, flowers, tea, and also wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are compounds that are responsible
for the color and aroma of flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and can also help attract pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, they can protect plants from
different biotic and abiotic stresses,
[SPEAKER_00]: and can act as UV light filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poison ivy, you might be feeling this,
is usually a green leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, when it first emerges, has a lot of
red tones to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way of protecting or shielding itself
from the harmful effects of the UV light
[SPEAKER_00]: until it gets established.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis, flavonoids may offer some
synergistic effects, but of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: more research is needed, and hopefully
that research will be occurring with the
[SPEAKER_00]: gaining of popularity within the medical
community of just unlocking some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: powers that the cannabis plant may have.
Thank you.
