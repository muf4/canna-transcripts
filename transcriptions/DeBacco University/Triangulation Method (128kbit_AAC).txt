[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I'm going to be explaining the
triangulation method, how it relates
[SPEAKER_00]: typically to crime scenes, and
particularly to sketches and documentation
[SPEAKER_00]: of where things might be located.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the information I got was from
Ashlyn Pearson at the website found here
[SPEAKER_00]: at SlideShare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with triangulation method,
let's look at what is this about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well first off, in order to triangulate
anything, we need to have fixed points.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have areas of reference or to measure
off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no set setting of what has to be a
fixed point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically we're using the larger objects.
[SPEAKER_00]: These fixed points act as accurate
measurements that must be recorded so that
[SPEAKER_00]: the scale of the finalized sketch can be
prepared for court presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have these fixed points and that's
what's allowing us to establish this area
[SPEAKER_00]: and act as points that we can then measure
off of and from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the triangulation method of
locating evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well here in item A is 10 feet in the
southeast corner of the room and 8 feet in
[SPEAKER_00]: the southwest corner of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So north is this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: These measurements will always intersect
at point A's location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now what we're looking at and going
through, triangulation without a fixed
[SPEAKER_00]: item.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now how do we triangulate for part A
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So evidence must be triangulated with two
fixed points.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would object A be triangulated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not from using the corners of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our desk here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at triangulation without
that fixed point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the desk is not fixed since it's not
touching the walls located and has not
[SPEAKER_00]: been determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the desk needs to be fixed in space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to measure that to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is, one inch from this wall and
three feet from this wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Providing measurements, the desk is not
fixed in space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now object A can be fixed to the two fixed
points of the desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've established where that desk is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can measure from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So object A can now be fixed from the two
fixed points from the desk as depicted in
[SPEAKER_00]: the above sketch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five feet from here and six feet from
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've established where that desk is
located.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now progressing to object flush to the
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would object A be triangulated with a
desk that's flush to the wall?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well because it's flush to the wall we
don't have to measure behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can measure its distance from this wall
and we can now take our two fixed points
[SPEAKER_00]: from the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: One measurement is required to place the
desk along the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is flush with the wall making it
fixed and then the object is triangulated
[SPEAKER_00]: as usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it flush to both walls?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's stuffed in the corner,
how do we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we don't have to establish the desk
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can just measure from those corners of
that desk to get the triangulation where
[SPEAKER_00]: point A is located.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once evidence is triangulated it can be a
fixed point to triangulate other items
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if evidence A was here to evidence B we
can work also from that fixed point to
[SPEAKER_00]: this fixed point.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case object B.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rectangular coordinate method we
see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice kind of coordinating things where
object A and B might be located.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another great way at right angles to
again from the wall and distance from the
[SPEAKER_00]: wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Center of mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does this refer to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well a lot of times we're dealing with
blood splatter or some other forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: liquids.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we dealing with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how are we going to measure those?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to measure each three of those
in this case when I get a couple more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we're going to measure to what's
called the center of mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since blood droplets are no
particularly defined shape they are
[SPEAKER_00]: trained from the center of mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well this is our blood splatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of estimating the center to be
right there and that's where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: triangulating from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not any one particular droplet but from
the center of that mass there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly we have a projection sketch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see all the data that's included.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the triangulation that's included.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legend of what the letters correlate
and where north is located.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not to scale or you could say that
quarter inch equals a foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever fits the conditions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the level of detail that's
needed in the sketch and many times
[SPEAKER_00]: triangulating this the triangulation
method is used to denote for example where
[SPEAKER_00]: the bolt hole is in relation to the walls
to get an idea where that's located to be
[SPEAKER_00]: used and shown in courtroom settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for joining us.
