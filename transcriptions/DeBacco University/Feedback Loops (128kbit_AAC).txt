[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at feedback
loops and how they relate to the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while this initial example here looks
kind of like an engineering standpoint,
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like the suggestion of the
infinity sign because our body is
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly going back and forth trying to
maintain homeostasis, and that's exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what's kind of going on here with feedback
loops.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a way to kind of raise something.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be a way also to lower
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at two specific types
of feedback loops here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the first one,
we're going to call it a negative feedback
loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has a response that is reverse of the
change that's detected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an example would be thermal regulation
and blood sugar regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look here at the body temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our normal body temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The body temperature decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's going to cause through a
negative feedback loop is the body is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to shiver and it's going to cause an
increase in the body temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if that body temperature increases too
much, well then we're going to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: negative, which is basically the opposite
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have cooling mechanisms
such as sweating that occurs that help us
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce our body temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at negative feedback,
if something's decreasing, then the loop
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to cause an increase to occur and
just vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: If an increase occurs, we're going to have
a decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: How this looks in a little bit more
complicated sense is the release of
[SPEAKER_00]: adrenal corduroids, which is stimulated by
the release of hormones from the
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothalamus and pituitary gland.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is seen as inhibited when the gluteal
corduroids levels become elevated by
[SPEAKER_00]: causing negative signals on the pituitary
gland and hypothalamus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our nice happy body conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an imbalance that occurs here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within the body there's the
hypothalamus perceives low blood
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's causing an imbalance.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that's going to relate to is a
hormone to be released.
[SPEAKER_00]: This hormone release is going to cause a
cascading effect to help increase these
[SPEAKER_00]: blood levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: These blood is going to be released in the
various glands, which will hopefully cause
[SPEAKER_00]: a correction to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that correction will be evident by the
levels increasing in the blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: These increased levels though,
when the hypothalamus perceives normal
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations, it will stop releasing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here initially we had the release.
[SPEAKER_00]: The negative feedback system is now
causing the stopping of release of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: resulting in homeostasis to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind, negative feedback is when
if something's going to stimulate
[SPEAKER_00]: something, there will also be a way to
kind of suppress or reduce that from
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the opposite of negative feedback,
as you might have guessed, would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: positive feedback loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this involves the response that
reinforces or amplifies the change
[SPEAKER_00]: detected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Childbirth is one example in blood
clotting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to specifically hear these two
examples show childbirth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the nerve impulse from the
cervix that transmitted to the brain of
[SPEAKER_00]: the baby's head, pushing against the
cervix.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brain will then stimulate the
pituitary gland to release the hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hormone is carried into the
bloodstream to the uterus, and this
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulates the contraction of the uterus
towards the cervix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will then cause the baby's head to
hit against the cervix again, causing this
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of go around and around.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that same thing here with positive
feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, we're amplifying the signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stretch receptors are activated in the
uterus as the baby's growth takes up
[SPEAKER_00]: larger space in the uterus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will then signal the brain to release
the hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxytocin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This then will cause the uterine muscles
to contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conjections will get stronger until the
baby's delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this positive feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this kind of building or
amplification of this signal occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that gives you a little bit
of a background between negative feedback
[SPEAKER_00]: loops and positive feedback loops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
See you next time.
