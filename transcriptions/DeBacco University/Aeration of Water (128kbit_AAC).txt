[SPEAKER_00]: So here we'll look at aeration of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may come across as really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here we're just kind of a
pedal system where we're kind of mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: and splashing the water around,
adding oxygen and air to that water to
[SPEAKER_00]: help keep it well oxygenated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's some systems here I'm going to
describe which you may not be familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, we'll large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're pumping water into the air and
letting gravity cause it to fall back,
[SPEAKER_00]: creating a passive method of aeration,
it could be a really strong pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going to get really high,
causing it to fall back, or it can be just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of these smaller pumps here,
again, pumping it up and letting it kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of fall back through gravity, kind of this
kind of passive form of aeration,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can be very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's used a lot for display purposes
in fountains to keep the water aerated in
[SPEAKER_00]: areas that may be in public displays,
such as parks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The active form of aeration for growers is
commonly used by injecting air into the
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This typically uses an air stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking an air stone, putting it at
the bottom of a tank, using an air pump to
[SPEAKER_00]: pump water, pump the air down through a
tube, and then letting the air bubbles
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of come through the water and mixing
it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This uses oxygen that's naturally in the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this depends on increasing the water
surface contact with the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of how you're helping aerate
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bubbles here are kind of, for the most
part, passing right through, reaching the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface and kind of stirring that surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's that surface contact that surface
stirring that's occurring that is allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: an aeration process to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you may not be familiar with or
may have heard of, but not related to this
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect, is the use of electrolysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So electrolysis of water is a
decomposition of water into oxygen and
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen gas due to the passage of
electrical current.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens to be of our water,
and we're separating it out into its
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen and oxygen components.
[SPEAKER_00]: By this process of electrolysis,
this creates a very small nanoscale,
[SPEAKER_00]: so really, really small, bubbles that
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: How this looks here, and there's a
comparison between an air stone versus
[SPEAKER_00]: taking an active air pump, pumping air
through here, and allowing the bubbles to
[SPEAKER_00]: pass through the water, causing a bubble
effect here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the electrolysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost looks like there's a small fog
occurring underneath the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: An O2 grow is marketed towards growers,
and this twin star is also marketed
[SPEAKER_00]: towards aquarium enthusiasts, but they
both kind of operate on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: electrolysis form versus the air stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The O2 grow company, they're a division of
oxygen research group, and their
[SPEAKER_00]: technology platform holds four unique
patents.
[SPEAKER_00]: With their electrolysis technique,
they claim 50% or more dissolved oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: than a standard bubbler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their slogan's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says get out of the stone age in the
sense that they feel their system is
[SPEAKER_00]: creating these small nanobubbles,
actively oxygenating the water much more
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively than a typical air stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does require a little bit of a setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a cost involved with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's electricity required, so these are
all things to consider as growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I include two YouTube links down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, in the description, there's a
link to all these slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click on these links and see some
of the company info there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to provide you with
something when you're looking at actively
[SPEAKER_00]: aerating water, priming down a solid
electrolysis, and it might be something
[SPEAKER_00]: worth consideration because of the
increased surface area here of the
[SPEAKER_00]: producing of the nanobubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're really looking at maximizing the
aeration and oxygen you're adding to your
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
