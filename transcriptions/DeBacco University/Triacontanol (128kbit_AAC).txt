[SPEAKER_00]: Here we'll look at the plant hormone
trichanthinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while this may be sold in powders for
growers to use because of its many listed
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits in research, be careful where you
purchase those powders and exactly the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations you're using because it can
have very fast effects on plants and very
[SPEAKER_00]: variable effects that can also cause plant
harm if you use too much of it as with any
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, where is it found?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's found in the cuticle waxes and
in beeswax, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a growth stimulant for many plants,
so it works across many different plant
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research has reported that it can improve
growth and yield in photosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_00]: protein synthesis, uptake of water and
nutrients, nitrogen fixation, and enzyme
[SPEAKER_00]: activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these are great things that growers
are always seeking for ways to improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why this hormone trichanthinol,
OBVTIA, has gotten so much attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it can increase free amino acids and
reduce sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very fast-acting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, being applied at nanomolar
concentrations, that's very small
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations, there's been reports
within one minute of the roots and plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and shoots noticing an effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this hormone in particular can work
extremely fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: One to five minutes of application,
there can already be a plant response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's important if you're looking at
adding this to be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can change the potential
physiology of the plant very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the benefits, though, are that it
can increase dry matter production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could lead to an increase in secondary
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: All great things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also strong evidence that
application of trichanthinol applied to
[SPEAKER_00]: either the root medium or the leaves
enhance the growth and yields of
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables and other crops, including
agragamic and horticultural crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as medicinal and aromatic crops
under normal and adverse conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is great potential research
showing that this can help improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: yield of crops with very small quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can act very quickly in those crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it continues to look at
further research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because while we may be noticing these
benefits, particularly for vegetables,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's something we're consuming,
we want to make sure that it's tested and
[SPEAKER_00]: vetted through a proper process so that
it's safe for human consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
