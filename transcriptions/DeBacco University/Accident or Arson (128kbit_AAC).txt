[SPEAKER_00]: In this video lecture here at Tobacco
University, we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: investigating a fire and trying to
determine whether it was an accident or
[SPEAKER_00]: arson and what clues can help us indicate
what category of fire may fall into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So accidental fires, typically they're
going to be sources of heating system,
[SPEAKER_00]: electrical equipment, children playing
with matches, smoking, cooking,
[SPEAKER_00]: all those would be classified or fall
under the category of an accidental fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we're looking at non-accidental
fires, well, an obvious one would be
[SPEAKER_00]: obvious odors in gas or kerosene,
for example, in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lack of personal objects and valuables,
if they're all kind of removed for some
[SPEAKER_00]: reason in the fire, none of those are
found.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be an indication that may have
been pre-planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also checking debris for clothing,
such as buttons or zippers, windows and
[SPEAKER_00]: doors being locked or blocked could also
be an indication, sadly, of a
[SPEAKER_00]: non-accidental fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than one point of origin indicating
it's starting at multiple areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inverted V patterns is a sign that an
accelerant was used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And charred floors can indicate the use of
an accelerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the use of an accelerant could lead us
to believe it'd be a non-accidental fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, suspicious circumstances involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the presence of combustibles to aid
and increase the rate of combustion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a lot of paper left around,
newspaper, for example, or just wood items
[SPEAKER_00]: can help increase that rate of combustion.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are frequently detected by canons
trained to detect inidable liquids by
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling fire debris, if those accelerants
were used, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Investigators can also detect the presence
of these liquids from pore patterns,
[SPEAKER_00]: investigating how a burn pattern may have
occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can remain on the burnt substrate
after the fire, which can indicate clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: there was gasoline added as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be clear evidence that it'd
be very suspicious and probably not just
[SPEAKER_00]: one that happened by accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we're looking at arsenin in
particular, there are potential motives
[SPEAKER_00]: for starting a fire, while there are many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we're looking at crime
concealment, if something else was to
[SPEAKER_00]: occur to conceal a crime, such as a murder
or a robbery of some kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes just out of spite to get back at
someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monetary gain for looking at profit from
the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be due to insurance coverage,
a competitor of a business, anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that regards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes just vandalism, where a fire is
set to someone's property just to destroy
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the largest percentage of arsen
fires, which are typically set by
[SPEAKER_00]: juveniles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the mentally disturbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people just have been found to be
kind of have that impulse for whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: reason to set fires.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we talked about this pore pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pore patterns are typically,
we're looking at use of an accelerant
[SPEAKER_00]: being determined to be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pore patterns are often
characterized by an intermixed light,
[SPEAKER_00]: medium, heavy burning in a puddle shape
that corresponds to the shape of the
[SPEAKER_00]: original pool of the ignitable liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is important to try to identify
that in the fire remains, so you can start
[SPEAKER_00]: investigating this in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now indicators of the flammable liquid
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at an unnatural flame
movement that could be downwards or simply
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring faster than would be expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of the graphing of wood or floor
seams caused by the pooling of a liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no identified point of origin of a
fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like spread out over a
region, probably indicates that they're an
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerant or a flammable liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flammable liquid was used, which indicates
or favors strongly arson being the main
[SPEAKER_00]: cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowing underneath appliances and
furniture is burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically these objects would shield
flames.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people may want to start the fire
under there to make it seem like,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, the stove cotton fire,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: For noticing inverted cone shaped burn
patterns on vertical surfaces can also
[SPEAKER_00]: indicate a flammable liquid was most
likely used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these V burn patterns, the classic V
shape is the normal burn pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this inverted V or cone tends to
indicate that an accident or use of an
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerant was used.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here with looking at the
refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that clear kind of point of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that V pattern developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see clear evidence of this door having
minimal damage, indicating that fire
[SPEAKER_00]: started definitely on this left panel of
the image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burn pattern with the accelerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind that we're looking at
possible areas of an accelerant being
[SPEAKER_00]: used.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have different ways we can kind of
pattern those.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's allegory, which is a possible
accelerant use, which is looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: scaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's breakaway layers, such as
spalding, that was possible accelerant
[SPEAKER_00]: usage as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have streamers or tails in that
accelerant, again, helping indicate that
[SPEAKER_00]: some flammable liquid may have been used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or poor plant, maybe that puddle,
indicating if the accelerant was poured in
[SPEAKER_00]: an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have evidence of an accelerant
burn pattern on a condom.
[SPEAKER_00]: On concrete floor and kind of what that
may look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also don't want to forget about
electrical burn patterns and they cause an
[SPEAKER_00]: arc damage in the evidence of an
electrical fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these can also create points of origin
as well and something to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these could definitely be accidental.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be looking at circuits,
how well, how much they're loaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll look at breaker boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these don't get just caught up
on the potential use of accelerants,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as flammable liquids or gasoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't also forget about looking and
investigating the potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity to be the source of the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much for your attention.
