[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, someone who's new to cannabis
growing or just gets a recent medical
[SPEAKER_00]: license and wants to start growing,
I typically kind of refer to those as kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of the hubby cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will look for locations that are
kind of easily accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to give you kind of some
basic ideas of the room locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may choose also with some pros and
cons associated with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, the basement for hubby
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's relatively consistent conditions,
easy to access, kind of down below is a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice typically has to do with water
potentially, easy to access.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bring large plant materials,
but can be hard to kind of clear out or
[SPEAKER_00]: get prepared to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also hanging lights can be an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be careful of the moisture if
the basement does flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can be some issues associated with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: An attic for hubby growers, a typically
minimal effort to set up, typically large
[SPEAKER_00]: and airy, access to fresh outside air.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, temperature fluctuations can be
extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important that climate control is
considered in this type of setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the garage or shed for hubby
growers, typically it's a quick,
[SPEAKER_00]: easy, large space to easily find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Access to power can be very easy as long
as bringing in outside air.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the downfall is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at, you know, garages or
sheds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be issues with having enough power,
moving cars, moving certain furniture,
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping things clean and sterile can also
be an issue with garage or shed
[SPEAKER_00]: operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why if you're going to become a
dedicated grower, especially for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes, you want to have a room that's
specifically allocated with good
[SPEAKER_00]: cleanliness, good access to power to allow
net lane efficient grow and a safe grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also one that is clean and won't breed
a lot of diseases and cause issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the issues with the hubby
growers in general is that they can kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of be quickly put together and that can
lead to a lot of negative effects both in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant and end product.
