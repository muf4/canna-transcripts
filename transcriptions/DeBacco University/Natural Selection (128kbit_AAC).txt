[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to be looking at some of
the details behind natural selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural selection here might be familiar
with the finches and the bird's beaks and
[SPEAKER_00]: also with these two different colored
moths and how they're able to survive in
[SPEAKER_00]: different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, well, how does biological
evolution happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's two main ideas on how traits
or genes can be passed on to the next
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: One theory is that individuals evolve
where inheritance of acquired
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics are somehow passed on to
the offspring or the concept that with
[SPEAKER_00]: these leaves being at the highest point on
these trees, because giraffes stretch
[SPEAKER_00]: their necks to constantly eat,
those individuals evolve to have kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: longer necks that then go on to the next
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ends up being the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does end up happening is a theory of
populations evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a selection of genes already
within a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Changes within those genes, frequencies in
a population leads to that change over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example, we just have some
giraffes that are just naturally born
[SPEAKER_00]: taller because they're able to acquire
food easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to survive or more likely to
survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, they pass their genes on to the
next generation in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can also see this with human
directed selection through domestication
[SPEAKER_00]: of animals and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sheep is an example of domesticating
animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see wheat or corn would be an
example of domesticating plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have breeding for extreme
variations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can breed for very small pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I breed for very large pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have dog sizes, the Great Dane
being a very large dog and the Chihuahua
[SPEAKER_00]: being a very small dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those extremes of the variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now within our evidence for the selection
theory of change, natural selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: same process.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there is no human direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we could have ecological
equivalence through analogous anatomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at the fin of a shark.
[SPEAKER_00]: A penguin and of a dolphin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a fish, a bird, and a mammal both
developing these structures to aid them in
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to swim within the water
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we have the same process without
human selection, looking at natural
[SPEAKER_00]: selection with homologous anatomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where there's a common ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where if we look at the human arm,
the cat, the whale, and the bat,
[SPEAKER_00]: while they may all perform very different
functions, grabbing, walking, swimming,
[SPEAKER_00]: flying, they all have the same basic
structure or anatomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, again, evidence for natural
selection theory of change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within this theory of change, we have drug
and pesticide resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This becomes an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have a collection of bugs that are
eating a crop or eating a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have this first generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a pesticide application is applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for whatever reason, the red bugs have
our natural resistance to that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple of the other color you're
able to survive just based on their
[SPEAKER_00]: location, maybe when the spray occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next generation, we see bugs of the
same number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the same chemical is applied,
well, now we have that selection process
[SPEAKER_00]: for those red bugs being able to survive
in greater numbers, meaning this chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: spray has these bugs have a resistance to
this pesticide or this chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Charles Darwin came up with the idea
of natural selection here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1831, Charles Darwin took the role of
naturalist in the ship HMS Beagle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sailed on a five-year navigational
trip around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of see his track here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He studied a wide variety of plants and
animals across the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of particular importance, he was known
for his studies he did in the Galapagos
[SPEAKER_00]: Islands, and they're located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a little image here of what they
actually look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different sizes in a small cluster,
pretty far off any large mainland.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allowed some very unique things to
develop here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now his observations, convinced him that
evolution took place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fossils of extinct species resembled
living species in the same area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Galapagos finches differed slightly in
their appearance, but resembled those in
[SPEAKER_00]: South American mainland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though they're separated by quite
the distance, there's some strong
[SPEAKER_00]: resemblance that they may have migrated or
traveled from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1859, he published his book,
The Origin of Species.
[SPEAKER_00]: In it, he proposed that evolution occurs
through the process of natural selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a copy of that top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Charles Darwin, he made observations
that eventually convinced him that
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution took place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fossils from extinct species resembled
living species in the same area.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example of this was his Galapagos
finches that he studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Differed slightly in appearance,
but resembled those in South American
[SPEAKER_00]: mainland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deciding that there may be some connection
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1859, he published his book,
The Origin of Species, located right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where he proposed that this evolution
occurs through the process of natural
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, even though we may know that as his
most, quote, famous work, he was most
[SPEAKER_00]: proud of his work that he did on
earthworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was fascinated by their behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: He conducted 40 years of earthworm
experiments that occurred both in the lab
[SPEAKER_00]: and in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you struggle with a lab
experiment, just think he spent 40 years
[SPEAKER_00]: just looking at earthworms and amongst
other things that he studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: He published his findings in 1881 in the
book that we see pictured here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The book sold 6,000 copies in its first
year, selling faster than The Origin of
[SPEAKER_00]: Species when it was first published.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did find it on Amazon in hardcover for
$45.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also some softcover options
available for a reduced cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the theory of natural selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he came up with the idea, but what is
that theory of natural selection?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he observed 14 different finch
species that differed mainly in the beaks
[SPEAKER_00]: and feeding habits.
[SPEAKER_00]: He concluded that the results were
descendants with modifications from a
[SPEAKER_00]: common ancestor, or as we now term it,
evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning there was an original common
ancestor that ate seeds, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that ate leaves, insects,
tool using and grubs and buds or fruit had
[SPEAKER_00]: to develop different beaks to be able to
best match or fit the modifications for
[SPEAKER_00]: their particular environment that they
were living in.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the food item that they were
eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here the insect eating bird is a very
small and pointed beak able to grab maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: small insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those eating buds or large fruit has
developed a very strong beak to maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: break a shell of a nut, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the theory of natural selection,
we kind of see evident here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Darwin was familiar with artificial
selection used by breeders to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: animals and plants with particular traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're familiar with maybe broccoli or
kale or even cabbage or cauliflower,
[SPEAKER_00]: they all kind of go back to wild mustard
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through artificial selection through
breeding, and selective breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say, growers have been able to
take the wild mustard and produce kale,
[SPEAKER_00]: broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage and
cauliflower with modifications to certain
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's the stem or the leaves or the
terminal bud or the flower buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get all of these different strains
that we're maybe familiar with,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they all can be traced back to a
common ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dog breeding is another example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dog breeding is shown in enormous amount
of variability due to the target selection
[SPEAKER_00]: of particular traits by man.
[SPEAKER_00]: If wolf is the common ancestor,
Europe, America, China and India have all
[SPEAKER_00]: bred for different subsets of that
selection process, but they all can be
[SPEAKER_00]: traced back to the common wolf ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process of natural selection,
these traits selection can occur in
[SPEAKER_00]: nature, which he termed again that natural
selective process, and this occurs in
[SPEAKER_00]: response to a number of conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be simple variation in color
within a population that's inherited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be bright yellow or dark brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overproduction of offspring leads to
competition for survival, who's a best fit
[SPEAKER_00]: for their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This leads to adaptations where
individuals with beneficial adaptations
[SPEAKER_00]: are more likely to survive and pass on
their genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see the brightly colored one
easily sticking out, easily getting eaten
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the ones that blend in or
camouflage a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this ultimately leads to a selection
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over many generations, there is a change
in allele frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is leading to the concept of
evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this theory of natural selection here
also applies to kind of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Darn was influenced by Malthus' essay,
The Principle of Population.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is back in 1798, where populations
increase exponentially while food supplies
[SPEAKER_00]: increase only in kind of a linear scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thus food supply will limit population
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have in this example,
our population growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, our population is below the
kind of food threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a food surplus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then over time, if population grows,
there'll be a food shortage and this will
[SPEAKER_00]: lead to competition in who's a best fit
for the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, our four fundamentals of natural
selection proposed by Charles Darwin and
[SPEAKER_00]: Alfred Wallace.
[SPEAKER_00]: He proposed that there were heritable
traits to be able to come in, to be passed
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Limiting factors exist in all
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overpopulation of offspring lead to those
at best fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And reproduction by those who are that
best fit, are able to fit that
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of see here initial allele
frequency of all the colors is equal,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then there is a selection for whatever
reason, in this case, the red circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time, that allele frequency of
the red becomes much greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that the pink here is basically
selected against as does the yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adaptation of populations is the result of
this natural selection process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this kind of gives you some
appreciation for the natural selection
[SPEAKER_00]: process and kind of what Darwin kind of
came up with and was able to theorize
[SPEAKER_00]: based on his observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
