[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to another Tobacco University
video, here looking at different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see three general categories
provided here, annealed, tempered,
[SPEAKER_00]: and laminated, along with some properties
listed below them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to go into even more
detail here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first starting with, well, how is glass
made?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, glass is a hard brittle amorphous,
which means its molecules lack
[SPEAKER_00]: organization material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's made from fused inorganic
materials by melting sand, lime,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sodium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This varies in elemental form,
again, depending on what type of glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, many shapes and colors
can be derived in glass, as we see here
[SPEAKER_00]: with all the various birds and various
ornamentals of glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the manufacturing process as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the most common type of glass,
which accounts for 90% of manufactured
[SPEAKER_00]: glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're finding this type at a crime
scene, it may not be the best at kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into this very something very
specific, but it can still provide other
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable trace evidence by linking someone
to a crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why it's so common is it's
found in window panes, beverage bottles,
[SPEAKER_00]: and light bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a density of 2.44 grams per cubic
centimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have borosilicate glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: This melts at a higher temperature than
typical silicate glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's used in cookware and lab
equipment, such as beakers, where high
[SPEAKER_00]: heat tends to be involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also known by its trade name,
Pyrex, since 1915.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what a lot of the beakers here
are made of, or even this measuring cup
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see Pyrex listed right in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a density very similar to the
sodium lime glass at 2.23 grams per
[SPEAKER_00]: centimeter cubed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have leaded glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is fine glassware and decorative
art glass called crystal leaded glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as it substitutes lead oxide for
calcium oxide or lime, make it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more environmentally friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The addition of lead oxide makes the glass
denser, and as light passes through the
[SPEAKER_00]: more dense glass, the light waves are
bent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gives the glass that sparkling
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really important for its visual
characteristics, but now can also be used
[SPEAKER_00]: to tie in when you're collecting it
potentially as trace evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have tempered or safety glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is stronger than ordinary glass by
introducing stresses through rapid heating
[SPEAKER_00]: and cooling of the glass at surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when tempered glass breaks,
it doesn't shatter, but rather fragments
[SPEAKER_00]: or dices into small squares with little
splintering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used for side and rear windows in
automobiles sold in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, it's the side and the rear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at it through a polarizing
lens or if you're wearing sunglasses and
[SPEAKER_00]: then kind of tilt your head a little bit
to one side or the other, you can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: see that kind of tempered or safety glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a certain look to it, particularly
looking here at the rear car window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's important I said side and rear a
car window because laminated glass is the
[SPEAKER_00]: glass used on the front windshield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laminated glass drives its strings by
sandwiching one layer of plastic between
[SPEAKER_00]: two pieces of ordinary window glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The windshields of all cars manufactured
in the United States are constructed of
[SPEAKER_00]: laminated glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as a result, we can kind of see
here, it doesn't shatter and break
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of fractures, but stays together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very important for the windshield
so nothing's coming at the driver or
[SPEAKER_00]: passengers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have bulletproof glass and as the
name implies, looking at resisting the
[SPEAKER_00]: impact from bullets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It achieves this by a combination of two
or more types of glass, one hardened one
[SPEAKER_00]: and one soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: The softer layer makes the glass more
elastic so it can flex instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: shattering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The index of refraction for both the
layers must be very similar though.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is to keep the glass transparent and
allow a clear view through the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why looking at this glass in
particular very quickly won't be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly identify it as being bulletproof
or not because it should look like normal
[SPEAKER_00]: glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bulletproof glass does vary in
thickness from three quarters of an inch
[SPEAKER_00]: to three inches and that can depend how
many layers there are.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a rough kind of depiction here of
bulletproof glass composed of layers of
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic sheeting, which would be the gray,
and then layers of actual typical glass
[SPEAKER_00]: and that would be the blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will resist depending how many layers
the caliber or the force of impact,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much will it resist that bullet that's
coming at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have optical or flint glass and
this has a high refractive index on RIF
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.45 to 2.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: A disposal poses a pollution problem for
older glass manufactured of this type
[SPEAKER_00]: because they tend to contain lead two
oxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now titanium dioxide and zirconium dioxide
are used making it less of an issue while
[SPEAKER_00]: still maintaining its great optical
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also used to make simulated diamonds
because it has this very clear high
[SPEAKER_00]: refractive index.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light dispersion here in the image above
me is looking at the mercury vapor lamp in
[SPEAKER_00]: a prism made of flint glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that really high optical quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we have mirrored glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is glass that's been treated with
metallic substances creating mirror-like
[SPEAKER_00]: properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be so we can be able to see
ourselves in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just another type of mirrored or
reflective glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these have the potential to be
found at a crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that you're well versed in them,
when you're picking up these pieces of
[SPEAKER_00]: trace evidence, you can make these
connections potentially identify the type
[SPEAKER_00]: of glass and where it might be found at a
crime scene.
