[SPEAKER_00]: Something that's typically thought of more
in outdoor growing operations is crop
[SPEAKER_00]: consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, within the cannabis industry,
this can also apply to indoor growing as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned in this Tobacco University
video to learn just more about this
[SPEAKER_00]: potential job opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into crop consulting
in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, this is applicable both to
indoor as well as outdoor growing
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off the job description,
consultants assist growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The selection of plant material can offer
what may work best for the growers given
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This typically involves field-based
evaluations of growing practices and
[SPEAKER_00]: season, but can also be applied to indoor
growing operations as well, as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe ceiling height or area can be taken
into consideration, and suggestions can be
[SPEAKER_00]: made as far as what plants or what
varieties of cultivars might be the best
[SPEAKER_00]: selection to choose to fit that particular
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day-to-day activities of a crop
consultant address patient concerns and
[SPEAKER_00]: questions regarding the challenges it may
be seeing currently in the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're seeing like a really windy
area or an area that floods easily,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, timing your planting,
maybe one with autoflowers suggestions
[SPEAKER_00]: that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Provide product expertise and knowledge to
growers by offering suggestions to help
[SPEAKER_00]: alleviate current issues that may be
observed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintain privacy and confidentiality of
sensitive information, because some of
[SPEAKER_00]: this information might be kind of that
developed, particularly in indoor growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: that might have certain patents protecting
it or things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maintaining that confidentiality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually entering all providing data,
such as soil tests, yields, irrigation to
[SPEAKER_00]: help develop a personalized plan of
action, for that particular grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now qualities a person must have looking
at crop consulting and crop consulting in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Positive attitude and strong work ethic,
because you do have to go out and usually
[SPEAKER_00]: visit a lot of different farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can handle the weather extremes while out
in the field during the entire year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cold, the hot, the rain, the humidity,
the lack of humidity, all those need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: taken into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Familiarity with their state's medical
marijuana program and laws to know what's
[SPEAKER_00]: legal and what can be advised to the
people growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extensive knowledge on the different
strains available and the conditions they
[SPEAKER_00]: may prefer, some strains is good knowledge
to have to be able to pass on to potential
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be able to recognize signs of potential
problems in the future to mitigate those
[SPEAKER_00]: or minimize their total negative effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the connection in general to the
cannabis industry is that cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: consultants are a direct link between the
growers and their crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to recognize current and
potential problems and offer corrective
[SPEAKER_00]: measures is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, being available to growers to
ensure potential sudden problems that may
[SPEAKER_00]: not have been foreseen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can be addressed when timing may be key to
control is an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could be based on quick email,
photograph, something to offer that grower
[SPEAKER_00]: that might be seeing a problem that
developing very quickly to hopefully get
[SPEAKER_00]: them ahead of that potential issue and
reduce the total negative impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, crop consulting typically
thought of as an outdoor growing
[SPEAKER_00]: environment with cannabis can also be
applicable to an indoor environment as well.
