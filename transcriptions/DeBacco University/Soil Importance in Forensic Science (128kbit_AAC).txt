[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to another DeBaco University
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here looking at soil's importance in
forensic science or something we may not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily always take into consideration
particularly for outdoor sites but can
[SPEAKER_00]: also sometimes apply to indoor sites is
the understanding of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off figure I should define what
soil basically is and it's the upper layer
[SPEAKER_00]: of the earth where plants grow and is
composed of a mixture of minerals,
[SPEAKER_00]: water, grasses, and organic decaying
remains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rocks that are broken down and mixed with
organic materials from living organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see the earthworm here in the
top of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially on a quick look all soil may
look to be the same but there's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: key and distinctive differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at forensic science
in particular we're looking at where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to find this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times we're inspecting footwear
or tires for example where soil can get
[SPEAKER_00]: lodged in the tread.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can help establish the likelihood
that a person or object was present at the
[SPEAKER_00]: scene of the crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just finding soil is one thing but now
identifying or potentially matching that
[SPEAKER_00]: soil up to a crime scene is the next step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at that soil as far
as a detail goes there are different types
[SPEAKER_00]: of soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can be looking at sandy soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have high porosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a relatively large particle
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gravel would be the largest as we see over
in this direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sand is also quite large.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water drains very quickly through that you
can think of the beach you watch a wave
[SPEAKER_00]: come over a sandy beach and water drains
right through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have silt soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like midsize particles and they
may be saying that's a pretty big jump
[SPEAKER_00]: from sand to silt and the image in while
it is clay is even smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that silt being that midsize it's
favorable for water holding supporting
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically a lot of farm type related soils
have a good percentage of silt in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then lastly we have clay which has very
small space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very very fine particles and because
of that those particles tend to fold and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of lay together almost looks like a
folding of pages of a book here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of like stacking on top of
one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that evident here and that's
what tends to be so fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to get almost like a sticky
consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're inspecting a sample of soil on
a visual basis this can be used a
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to dry the sample and observe the
color of that soil once dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at the particles that are present.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I remove any trace evidence that we
may find this could be fibers glass or
[SPEAKER_00]: hair and compare observations with control
samples or comparison of samples of crime
[SPEAKER_00]: scene to suspected or potential crime
scenes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have chemical composition of soil
samples so taking it one step further than
[SPEAKER_00]: just the visible means looking at what is
the chemical makeup of that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using a microscope you want to take a
subsample and a small drop of hydrochloric
[SPEAKER_00]: acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal there is to see if once added to
the soil if bubbles are formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could also say there's a color change
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you notice bubbles that's the present
of carbonates such as chalk or limestone
[SPEAKER_00]: and that can be an indication of some of
the chemical composition of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a yellow color that indicates
the presence of iron so some soils tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a little bit higher in iron and it's
been one way of determining that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to confirm the presence of iron by
adding a few drops of potassium cyanide
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is in observing green color in
that sample and this will help you
[SPEAKER_00]: determine with a very small soil sample
whether or not iron is present which can
[SPEAKER_00]: help classify a soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way to classify soil is looking at
the organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have any gardens a lot of people
look at what the organic matter is in
[SPEAKER_00]: their soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's performed by what's called an
ignition test where you dry the sample you
[SPEAKER_00]: weigh it you heat the sample to a very
high amount of heat 750 to 800 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: celsius for about an hour then you allow
it to cool and you re-weigh it and you
[SPEAKER_00]: would calculate the percentage of loss on
ignition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're essentially burning off some of the
components particularly the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: components of that soil and being left
only with the minerals and this can really
[SPEAKER_00]: help determine or classify a soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example on the extreme case if someone
walked through a potential compost pile
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at a very high organic matter and
that could be a way to classify or
[SPEAKER_00]: identify that particular soil type.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also soils pH which if you're
looking at growing plants something very
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also knowing the pH this can provide a
general idea of two soils if there could
[SPEAKER_00]: be a match.
[SPEAKER_00]: For having one that's really acidic or
really basic is there a potential that
[SPEAKER_00]: they matched or is it neutral so an odd
soil pH potentially did it have limestone
[SPEAKER_00]: added to it or did it have potash added to
it that can vastly affect the soil pH
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the native soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particle size distribution this is
referring to how much percentage of clay
[SPEAKER_00]: silt sand and gravel is present in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can involve the set of sieves to
separate the particle based on their size
[SPEAKER_00]: and calculate the weights percentage of
each size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just another factor another way we can
help classify that soil to get a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil changes in different regions so again
keep in mind that soil can change in small
[SPEAKER_00]: sections or in an area and this could be
where there might be plant material this
[SPEAKER_00]: could be the area where there's certain
plants growing with the land might land
[SPEAKER_00]: might be used for so all these to be taken
into consideration and the soil sample
[SPEAKER_00]: should be taken as close to the suspected
area where it was picked up on the tire
[SPEAKER_00]: tread or on the shoe as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole point and goal of this kind of
soil investigation is to provide increased
[SPEAKER_00]: links.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very common in hit-and-run
accidents automotive accidents burglaries
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor scenes in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using the visual and chemical methods
the goal is to establish links from the
[SPEAKER_00]: recovered and standard soil sample which
are very important in the great scheme of
[SPEAKER_00]: forensic science.
