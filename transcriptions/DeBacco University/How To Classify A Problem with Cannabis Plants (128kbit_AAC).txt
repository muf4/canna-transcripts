[SPEAKER_00]: While precisely diagnosing a problem may
not always be possible, this tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: university video intends to help you
classify problems of cannabis plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: general categories so you can better
direct your efforts to reduce their
[SPEAKER_00]: negative impact on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into how to classify a
problem with cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while many things can go wrong,
the goal is to try to classify the issue
[SPEAKER_00]: to help the diagnosis process along with
the potential corrective action to be
[SPEAKER_00]: taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main categories covered will be biotic
and abiotic, underbiotic or living,
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases and insects, abiotic will look at
nutrients, spray products, moisture,
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, as well as physical damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with biotic, well biotic is
again living, these typically refers to a
[SPEAKER_00]: broad range of disease, insects,
or animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: While biotic means living, viruses are
typically included within this group.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also considered fungi, bacteria,
protists, animals, archaea, all these are
[SPEAKER_00]: classified antibiotic factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now disease is probably the most obvious
one that most people go to, here we see
[SPEAKER_00]: some powdery mildew getting started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diseases can have varying degrees of
impact depending on the variety being
[SPEAKER_00]: grown in some cases, but not always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some varieties may have different levels
of resistance to some disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when the pressure is low or
when it initially comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diseases also tend to spread over time
with the rate being impacted by how
[SPEAKER_00]: favorable the environment is for that
particular disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's also insects, here we see
some aphids on the underside of this
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insects can have hatches, meaning their
numbers can increase drastically in a very
[SPEAKER_00]: short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scouting the shadier portions of the plant
is a good starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Controlling insects is important as some,
particularly aphids pictured here,
[SPEAKER_00]: can vector diseases and viruses as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to some abiotic factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are non-living factors that can
impact plant growth and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically the rate and extent of damage of
plants is uniform across varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: As also ages of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Abiotic issues tend not to slowly spread
but occur kind of at a point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a drastic change in
temperature, sunlight, climate,
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with nutrients,
looking at nutrients to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that these can be impacted by pH as
well as concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to recognize deficiencies is
important, but at the same time
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding how much to feed the plant
is key to avoid potential nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicities, which oftentimes with cannabis
tends to be more of an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping records and following
manufacturers suggestions are both good
[SPEAKER_00]: starting points to ensure you're not going
into the toxic range or the deficient
[SPEAKER_00]: range when it comes to nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to spray products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers may have to apply control products
to their leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can offer very efficient and
efficient effective coverage, but at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time it can risk damaging tender leaf
surfaces, particularly your newer leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch the concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Method and timing of your application.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to avoid forceful applications at
high light intensity times as well to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the chance of getting sort of
grower induced spray damage to your
[SPEAKER_00]: particular leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have moisture to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers tend to overwater their plants
and this reduces aeration within the root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since plants roots need oxygen,
overwatering can cause plants to drown and
[SPEAKER_00]: also cause stunting of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underwatering though can cause wilting,
which if caught early can be corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember a plant's water demands will
change as it ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as it gets older, more roots,
larger top structure, the demand or the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of irrigation that will require is
going to be greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at different
temperatures, more is not better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to keep plants in a natural
daily rise and fall of temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extremes will cause plant stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: While outdoor environment regulation of
this may not be possible, other measures
[SPEAKER_00]: such as increased irrigation frequency or
potentially use of shade netting should be
[SPEAKER_00]: considered when possible to reduce plant
stresses in an outdoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also keeping an idea of the high and low
temperature, the humidity as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of that 24 hour monitor is a great
suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperatures above 9 degrees Fahrenheit
below 55 degrees Fahrenheit will be
[SPEAKER_00]: outside the acceptable range and will
hinder plant performance overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we get to physical damage and this
may be easy to say, but be careful around
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, especially when pruning and also
scouting and also transporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers simply are just tougher on
their plants than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be mindful if you're one of those
growers that just has a heavy hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: When transporting plants, this can cause
damage to the branches, maybe as we can
[SPEAKER_00]: see here, and try to implement or reduce
the chance of that impact has on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If growing outdoors, wind can also cause
physical damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure to provide plant supports if
your plants will be growing in a large
[SPEAKER_00]: size where this may be a likely source of
damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this allows you to generally
classify potential problems you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing with your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can further refine a more
specific diagnosis once you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: proper category determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully this video here in Tobacco
University helped you categorize your
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining us.
