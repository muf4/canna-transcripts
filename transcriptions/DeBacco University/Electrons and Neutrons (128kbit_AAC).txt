[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at
electrons and neutrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're two of the subatomic particles
located in an atom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the energy levels of electrons,
we're going to start with the electrons
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy is the capacity to cause change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now energy, as we have discussed earlier,
energy in human life, we have our chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: energy here being converted into ATP,
which is the body's energy currency as
[SPEAKER_00]: part of our metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is heat given off and chemical
waste given off, but the energy of those
[SPEAKER_00]: electrons, so it's a lot of this type of
energy, which is the capacity to cause
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main molecule is ATP, adenosine
triphosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the energy levels of electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's two main types.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's potential energy, which is
probably how you're feeling about right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stored energy that can be released,
commonly referred to as chemical potential
[SPEAKER_00]: energy, which is the energy stored in the
bonds of molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think of it as like an energy at
rest there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have our kinetic energy,
which is the energy that's being currently
[SPEAKER_00]: used in a reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those chemical bonds that are just kind
of there, they have kind of that potential
[SPEAKER_00]: energy or that stored energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when a reaction is occurring,
we have that kinetic energy, as you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see here with the cat playing with the toy
mouse here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the energy currently being used in
a reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the energy levels of the electrons,
the electron of an atom differ in their
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of potential energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: An electron state of potential energy is
called the energy level or its electron
[SPEAKER_00]: shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we see here, the very bottom here
is called the ground state.
[SPEAKER_00]: As those electrons work their way out,
their energy level increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: These out here would be considered a bit
more of an excited state, and electrons
[SPEAKER_00]: can jump to these different electron
shells through different energy levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Realize the ground state is the most
basic, lowest energy form, and excited
[SPEAKER_00]: states as you work your way up the amount
of energy increases that those electrons
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So arrangement of electrons in an atom,
that first energy level can hold a maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: of two electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second and third energy levels can
hold, can contain up to eight electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see in the middle here with
hydrogen, one lonely proton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just with one proton, I didn't have to
tell you this was hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing one proton indicates that it's
hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing two protons indicates this is
helium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing here we have 10 protons,
a little hard to count there, it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: neon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three might be a little easier,
this is lithium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see those energy levels here of these
electrons working their way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice in all of these cases,
the first energy level can only hold a
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum of two electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second and third energy levels can
hold up to eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that indicated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna try to keep this fairly simple
on the smaller atoms, but the same holds
[SPEAKER_00]: true as we work our way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So classification of the elements,
families of elements share the same ending
[SPEAKER_00]: electron configuration, as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at group one and group
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were to count all the electrons in
the outer most shell here, we'd find that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's only one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outer most shell here, there's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outer most shell, there's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even all the way down here at Francium,
the outer most shell, there's only that
[SPEAKER_00]: one electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in group two, we notice that there's
two electrons in each one of these outer
[SPEAKER_00]: shells.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, they share similar chemical
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why all the elements in group
one have similar chemical characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that same one outside or valence
electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: That outside electron is gonna do the vast
majority of the reactions that's on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outer most area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The electrons kind of in the middle here
get stuffed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once on the outside doing the reaction,
group one has one outer one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Group two has two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these valence electrons that I
mentioned, move out of the way a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Valence electrons here are the ones on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: These electrons in the highest principle
energy level, and they determine the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical reactivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an important note to make there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elements in a group share the same number
of valence electrons as we see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these have eight valence electrons,
seven and six and five and four and three
[SPEAKER_00]: and two and one.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if we look here a little bit,
a little more closely, well, it'd be easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to think of one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven and eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an error in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure if you can spot that
particular error.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go through and you look at all
of the protons that these elements have,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, all of these have one valence
electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these have two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look up here, an element that is
located in this upper corner here does not
[SPEAKER_00]: have eight valence electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is helium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This actually only has two valence
electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say spot the error, the error is
located right here with helium having only
[SPEAKER_00]: two valence electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else in the noble gas family
will have eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at this kind of complexity of the
periodic table showing the electron shells
[SPEAKER_00]: as we see here, most of they do get a lot
more electrons as we get down to the rows
[SPEAKER_00]: six and seven of the periodic table.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind, all of these have the
same number of valence electrons,
[SPEAKER_00]: except again, remember helium has two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else in the noble gas family
has eight valence electrons, which as
[SPEAKER_00]: remember are the electrons located in the
outermost shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the octet rule, atoms tend to gain,
lose or share electrons in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: acquire a full set of eight valence or
outer shell electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elements with full valence shell are
chemically inert.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to have eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically has one, two, three,
four, five, six.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it combines with carbon here,
it's sharing these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore this count as part of oxygen,
it will have eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're being shared, they count
with carbon too and to count all the
[SPEAKER_00]: circles around carbon, we'll also see
eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's think of this octet rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an octagon and octopus or a
musical octet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each atom is trying to gain or lose or
share electrons in order to maintain that
[SPEAKER_00]: full octet or that eight valence electrons
in its outer shell.
So that's the octet rule.
