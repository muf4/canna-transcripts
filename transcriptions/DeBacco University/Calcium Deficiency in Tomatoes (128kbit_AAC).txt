[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to be looking at
calcium deficiency in tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, our tomatoes, we always want to look
this nice consistent red color,
[SPEAKER_00]: or in some cases, there might be some
yellow varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing that color consistent from
the very edge or margin all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in calcium deficiency,
you can see even at the immature stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: there'll be this browning that occurs
typically towards the blossom end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's first look at calcium's
importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, it's an immobile nutrient
that means it doesn't really travel very
[SPEAKER_00]: well through the plant, meaning
deficiencies tend to show up in areas
[SPEAKER_00]: where it needs to travel the furthest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Point being right here, if we look at the
image of the tomato, where the blossom end
[SPEAKER_00]: is, all the nutrients have to come from
the stem down through the early part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the tomato, the area that is the closest
to the main stock, and then that calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: travels down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's immobile, it doesn't travel
very far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the case of deficiencies,
the plant is more likely to show these
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency symptoms more towards the end
of the blossom because that's the furthest
[SPEAKER_00]: distance that calcium would have to
travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to prevent blossom and rot in the
most economical, it's very damaging to
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can lose an entire crop despite
growing the entire plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why this is of economic
importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium help form compounds and cell
walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what helps kind of keep their
integrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why areas here that have poor
calcium will be kind of soft as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: discolored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium also stimulates root and leaf
development and influences the uptake of
[SPEAKER_00]: other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more than just calcium, it also
influences other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be involved with cell
signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a tomato trial here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was done in a greenhouse in a
hydroponic setup here to help maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hydroponics allowed only very
specific nutrients to be added compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: if it was a soil-based system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see a control plant that
was fed a balanced fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: what a normal plant should look like,
and then the test plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was fed all the nutrients except
the one being studied to allow for the
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated deficiency symptoms to show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a perfect example of what
calcium deficiency actually looks like in
[SPEAKER_00]: a tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is even before, and this is a severe
case, before we even get to the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice the browning of the new leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this newer growth has that
browning that is occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: There tends to be more damage to the upper
or newer portions of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one characteristic of a calcium
deficiency in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind though, this plant has no
fruit yield in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the odds are not well of having a
marked fruit mature on this plant when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're seeing it in the plant,
even before you get flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, showing an extreme case,
we could see it definitely on the fruit in
[SPEAKER_00]: the other image, but here is what it looks
like in the actual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comparison, again, here's that same
plant there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had minus that calcium treatment,
and then we have the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a plant should look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be upright, but it grew so
aggressively, you could see it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: fell over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing the consistent green color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some areas though in the test plant do
have normal that green leaf color,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that most recent growth, that newer
growth tends to get that browning that
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we correct this problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, calcium should be fed to the plants
repeatedly since it does take time to
[SPEAKER_00]: build up in the plants, especially if a
deficiency does exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's two products here, one's called
BioMin Calcium, one called CalMagMax.
[SPEAKER_00]: BioMin starts you at an ounce per gallon
that can be applied to the leaves and a
[SPEAKER_00]: drench as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's OMRI certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now use caution when tank mixing because
it maintains and does not get along with
[SPEAKER_00]: other nutrients that are typically applied
alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: CalMagMax follow the same basic dilution
rates, not OMRI certified, but it does
[SPEAKER_00]: improve calcium and magnesium levels in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as always with most calcium products,
use caution when tank mixing so not to
[SPEAKER_00]: have any potential interactions that would
be unwanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeding these to a tomato plant
consistently or on a repeated schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: will help reduce the chance that you ever
see a calcium deficiency.
