[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to investigate the plant
hormone cytokinin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as the image shows here, it's two
cells dividing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember this process is called
cytokinesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's no surprise that cytokinins are
involved with cell division.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main functions of cytokinins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the first one is of course promoting
that cell division to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now cell division remembers mitosis in
that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if cytokinins create more cell division
or more mitosis, we know that more mitosis
[SPEAKER_00]: and more cell division simply mean more
cells, and more cells relates to plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cytokinins are involved in plant
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to cell division, they also
are responsible for lateral bud
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember along our stems we have these
lateral buds, and cytokinins will cause
[SPEAKER_00]: that to be able to grow outward at that
node along the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last main function of cytokinins is
delays senescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: What senescence is, is when leaves
basically age and develop and drop off the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can delay that process from
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can keep leaves on plants more useful
and on the plants longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one, cytokinins promotes cell
division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well cytokinins are actually first shown
to stimulate cell division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at our root tip here, it's an area
where there's a lot of mitosis going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of cell division, a lot of
cytokinins that plant hormones exist very
[SPEAKER_00]: high in this particular region of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also germinating seeds cytokinins can be
found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as a reminder, cytokinins,
cytokinesis sound very similar,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that can help you remember that
cytokinins are involved in cell division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cytokinins increase lateral bud
formations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here lateral buds kind of branching
out, cytokinins are involved in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They release buds from apical dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember from the auxin video lecture and
talked about apical dominance,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see auxins and cytokinins kind of play
off one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: When auxins are in high concentration,
we see rooting on shoots, we see root
[SPEAKER_00]: callus forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we're reducing our auxin levels,
we're increasing our cytokinin levels
[SPEAKER_00]: here, we see axillary buds developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cytokinins are responsible for those
lateral buds to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in evidence that cytokinins are in
higher proportion than auxins,
[SPEAKER_00]: because auxins are going to favor that
apical dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you can see another example here
of how two hormones interact with one
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that these hormones do exist
in very small amounts, but they can have
[SPEAKER_00]: very large impacts on plant behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cytokinins delay leaf senescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the fountain of youth hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by delaying or even reversing this
process, plant leaves could maintain their
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll longer, could delay protein
degradation, and increase the lifespan and
[SPEAKER_00]: drought tolerance of several plant
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here, a plant that's been
applied with cytokinins keeps the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: greener longer instead of this plant here
that has these dead dried out leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important here in tobacco plants,
especially here in Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow a lot of tobacco for final
wrappers for cigars, and the goal is to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep those leaves as youthful and as large
as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want plants going into senescence
here, where they get kind of crinkly and
[SPEAKER_00]: dried out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not really any good for the
wrappers of cigars.
[SPEAKER_00]: By applying cytokinins in some cases,
this could be a way, the fountain of youth
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone, to keep the leaves nice,
young, and youthful for longer periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, this is demonstrating cytokinins
and induced nutrient movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have three different plants here,
dicots, and they could be squash
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings, for example, and we're having a
cytokinins-treated leaf that shows the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of a radio-labeled tagged amino
acid, which is transferred from the
[SPEAKER_00]: untreated site, but tagged leaf site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this actually means here is we
have three plants, and we've applied a
[SPEAKER_00]: tagged amino acid here on these leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, notice here that tagged amino acid
remains in this leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been sprayed with just a
surfactant, that's just basically a
[SPEAKER_00]: carrier that's put in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This indicates that those radioactive
labeled amino acids stayed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we applied the radioactive amino acid
also to this leaf, but we treated this
[SPEAKER_00]: other leaf on the opposite side with a
cytokinin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We noticed that basically moved over,
culled those nutrients over, moved those
[SPEAKER_00]: radioactively labeled amino acids over to
this leaf, added by the dark green color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, just as a check, we applied the
radioactive amino acid in the cytokinins
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We noticed that they stayed in that leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows the influence that cytokinins
can have on culling over certain nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: and indicating that cellular division.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's gonna increase cellular division,
it's probably gonna require more
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, and that's part of the reason
why cytokinins can influence plant
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior in the sense of allocation of
certain nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that was helpful in explaining a
little bit about the impact cytokinins can
[SPEAKER_00]: have on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
