[SPEAKER_00]: In this DeBacco University video,
I'm going to go over optimizing magnesium
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer rates for cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, our goal is not to over-fertilize
plants, so how do we go about optimizing
[SPEAKER_00]: and avoiding plants that look like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at magnesium in
particular and its importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the research study and the
citation that goes along with it if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to look at the original study in more
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what's the importance of
magnesium?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why should we be concerned about
magnesium?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an essential macronutrient for plant
growth and metabolism, which may be
[SPEAKER_00]: disrupted under magnesium deficiency or
toxicity conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It involves the photosynthesis by
activation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ribose-bifosphate-carbolase-oxygenase
enzyme, typically referred to as Robisco,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as an essential component of the
chlorophyll molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that located right here as
magnesium molecule being right in the
[SPEAKER_00]: center of that chlorophyll molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's Robisco, important for the
photosynthetic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also important for cell division,
involved in the activation of several
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes, acts as a phosphorus carrier in
plants, is essential for plant
[SPEAKER_00]: respiration, and essential component,
again, of the chlorophyll molecules we saw
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many, many roles that magnesium plays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what are the deficiency symptoms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, interveinal yelling of the leaves,
typically first seen in the lower leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the older leaves on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, this is an extreme case,
but it did that interveinal, meaning if
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at the veins of the plant,
it's going to be in between those veins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interveinal is what that's referring to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, it's first seen on those lower
or older portion leaves first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, looking at the study here,
30 days after the initiation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium treatment, visual appearance of
the plants under 2, 20, 35, 40,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 140 milligrams per liter of magnesium
supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very top here, we're looking at the
plants themselves from kind of a zoomed
[SPEAKER_00]: out macroscope look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, magnesium concentration here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lowest here is on the left,
and the highest is on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to the next row here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the youngest mature
leaves in the second row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the older leaves off in the
bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this would be your third row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see definitely those older
leaves, definitely showing it here in that
[SPEAKER_00]: very low treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got the roots also in comparison
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which visually may not have very stark
differences, but again, we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole plant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the effect of magnesium supply
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the effect of magnesium supply on
macro and micronutrient concentrations in
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves, stems, and roots of medicinal
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So leaves are represented by the green
circles, stems by the red triangle,
[SPEAKER_00]: and roots by the dark blue squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see again, here's our
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is our potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is our calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our zinc, iron, manganese,
magnesium as well, and then phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the presented data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see as those magnesium
concentrations change, some things remain
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively stable, and other things have
changes, not always greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see that definitely at the low
concentration of magnesium to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's this immediately leveling off here
of nitrogen in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stems and also the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So leaves here, roots here, and then stems
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others correlate differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here for potassium, we see an overall
increase in our root amount of magnesium,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a decrease in the leaves and also the
stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just kind of an interesting correlation
or a look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as again, we increase magnesium,
we would expect magnesium concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: overall to increase in all parts of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this kind of mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this kind of relate to?
[SPEAKER_00]: And why should we be concerned about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because magnesium interacts
particularly with calcium as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So increased magnesium supply impaired the
uptake of calcium and potassium in their
[SPEAKER_00]: route to shoot translocation,
demonstrating a competitive cation
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, calcium and potassium are both
positive, or cations, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot of magnesiums here
globbing onto the negative soil particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to impair the root here's
ability to absorb those other cations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, it's going to kind of block
or suppress the ability for plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: absorb the very important potassium as
well as calcium ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having two, I have one nutrient can
block or suppress others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's the possible effects on that
soil aggregates as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Excessive fertilizer applications may have
more impact than just nutrient levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possible effects of calcium and magnesium
cations and soil aggregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: More calcium attracts clay particles
together to form aggregates or form
[SPEAKER_00]: basically well defined structure there
versus more magnesium repels clay
[SPEAKER_00]: particles and breaks apart those
aggregates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aggregates are important because we do
want them to have that cation exchange
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity and interact with the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we over add our magnesium,
we're causing repelling or breaking apart
[SPEAKER_00]: of that basic soil structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now min-max levels here, because it's
definitely a minimum level, magnesium
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency symptoms develop first in those
older leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was shown at two milligrams per liter
and progressed towards young mature
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, demonstrating the ability for
magnesium plant storage and also
[SPEAKER_00]: remobilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnesium toxicity symptoms appear in
older leaves from the bottom of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: under 140 milligrams per liter of
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the general target range and
what could we add to correct this if we're
[SPEAKER_00]: below optimum?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the findings suggest that 35 to 70
milligrams per liter of magnesium is the
[SPEAKER_00]: optimum concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it is a range for cannabis plant
development and function at the vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: growth phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be converted here to parts per
million or ounces per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, again, looking at pure
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about some fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to draw your attention to hear
that below optimum, again, there's the
[SPEAKER_00]: red, there's an optimum range,
and then there's above optimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get a soil test back,
you want to be in that optimum range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, and this shows the above optimum kind
of remaining level, but a lot of times if
[SPEAKER_00]: you get too excessive, can actually have a
decrease in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: The toxicity symptoms can lead to a
decrease in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So staying in that optimum range is really
the target of any grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're low in magnesium, what could
we add?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, dolomitic lime, if we need to adjust
our soils or substrates, pH would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: great addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That consumes about 9.5% magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epsom salts, if we need to have something
water soluble to water in, contains a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more magnesium, slightly,
9.87%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for something continuous feeding-wise,
and typically plants need calcium anyways,
[SPEAKER_00]: a Cal Mag fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, which may only have 1.2% magnesium,
but continually being fed can slowly build
[SPEAKER_00]: those levels up or really maintain those
levels within that optimum range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, don't want to get too excessive
because then negative things can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want to be under, we don't have
reduction in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to stay right in that optimum
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully this study gives you that
target of what that optimum range actually
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
Thank you.
