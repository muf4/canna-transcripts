[SPEAKER_00]: The term hydroponics is a broad category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to look at some of the
options within the category of
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this tobacco university video
looking at hydroponic options for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off the hydroponic advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are so many people looking at
hydroponics and why is it so popular?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is because if you dial in the
hydroponic system, then the odds are
[SPEAKER_00]: plants will grow faster than if you're
using soil, which is part of the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: for its popularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why this can happen is in
hydroponics and nutrients are directly
[SPEAKER_00]: available to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In soil, nutrients often have to be
converted before uptake and are bound to
[SPEAKER_00]: particles reducing the speed of their
variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other reasons why hydroponics is that
there is no soil to need, no media to need
[SPEAKER_00]: in that instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can get increased growth rate and use
less water if you know the term
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponics means with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be reduction in weeds to almost
zero nutrient efficiency and potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: less use of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now reasons against hydroponics because
they're not always, not even grows in
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponics, there's a reason for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the drawbacks is that hydroponics
is simply the upfront cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the grower needs to be sure
that all conditions are maximized on a
[SPEAKER_00]: continual basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a little less room for error.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, with pH, if the pH of the
nutrient solution changes or shifts,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can occur within a single day,
this could severely damage the roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: cause stunting of the actual plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If left for longer than a day,
this could result in the loss of the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: or just for a short period of time could
cause stunting and negative effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because unlike soil, there is no
buffer factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers are responsible for continually
monitoring conditions such as pH to ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: that everything is within the expectant
tolerances or ranges to maximize plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I mentioned, the importance of pH
with all hydroponics systems, growers must
[SPEAKER_00]: be mindful of the pH of the solution at
all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a continual monitor is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we just see, this is a Blue Labs
Guardian monitor going through and just
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure we're not having massive
shifts in anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we did notice the pH goes potentially
from 7.2 to 7.0, all the way quickly to
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at different substrates
here, but just keep in mind that sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: it can occur very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using a little pH strip is usually not
advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a digital monitor with a lot
readout.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can continually be checking to make
sure you catch some even slight changes
[SPEAKER_00]: very early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, different substrates in hydroponic
production, there are a lot to choose
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under the category of hydroponics,
there are many different substrates that
[SPEAKER_00]: can apply and still be called hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there is no root supportive
substrate, other times there are.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, with all substrates for
hydroponic production, typically they only
[SPEAKER_00]: supply a physical structure for the roots
and hold the varying degrees of water and
[SPEAKER_00]: allow for aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The substrates themselves do not really
produce or have a lot of nutrients to
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Popular options are clay pebbles,
or grow stones we see here, coco coir,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also rock wool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes even, quote, no substrate,
and just kind of using some rock pebbles
[SPEAKER_00]: here initially and then growing the roots
in kind of this aquatic environment there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, within hydroponic systems,
there are different systems that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: selected that all qualify or classify as
hydroponics, such as deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ebb and flow, indoor drip irrigation,
and aeroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn more about any of
these four presented here, check out
[SPEAKER_00]: DeBaco University for detailed videos on
each of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
