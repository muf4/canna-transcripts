[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, to go along with this unit on the
immune system, I figured I should mention
[SPEAKER_00]: two diseases that are particularly good at
evading the immune system, and describe
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little bit about how they're able
to go about avoiding all of the systems we
[SPEAKER_00]: have in place to hunt down and seek out
and prevent and destroy pathogens that
[SPEAKER_00]: enter our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one's probably the most obvious
and probably most familiar with,
[SPEAKER_00]: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this basically does, and I have two
great links here, so you're welcome to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the description and click the
links directly there, they mimic antigen
[SPEAKER_00]: presenting cells by activating the
macrophage and helper T cells CD4
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of an antigen, it actually
injects its own RNA and three enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: HIV is actually what we call a retrovirus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is taking RNA and it's transferring it
into DNA, incorporating it within the
[SPEAKER_00]: macrophages T helper cells in the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, because the HIV virus,
the DNA is involved in the host cell's T
[SPEAKER_00]: helper cells, it's able to hide within the
immune system and basically render the T
[SPEAKER_00]: helper cells as they replicate,
basically rendering them helpless,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll say, and not able to perform their
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So T helper cells replicate, destroys the
cells, and leaves the immune system unable
[SPEAKER_00]: to mount responsive to any foreign
antigens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we get the concept of AIDS.
[SPEAKER_00]: A variety of otherwise commonplace
infections prove fatal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're infected with HIV,
the virus itself here is not what actually
[SPEAKER_00]: kills you because it's essentially
knocking out or preventing T helper cells
[SPEAKER_00]: from performing their proper function.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're more likely to die from cancer or
even the common cold because you lack a
[SPEAKER_00]: functional immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great fader of the immune system,
is tuberculosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So specifically, mycobacterium
tuberculosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This resists the cell destroying enzymes
and replicates in the macrophages of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the immune system finally does
respond, the bacterium is protected by a
[SPEAKER_00]: thick waxy wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's come examples of what it looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The immune cells surround the bacterium,
walling it off, creating this tuberculae,
[SPEAKER_00]: but does not kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a key part there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bacteria becomes dormant until
something acts to weaken the immune
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of can stay there and kind of
hang out for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the immune system becomes
compromised, that's the time that it will
[SPEAKER_00]: start to replicate again, causing a new
outbreak.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why typically people need
tuberculosis screenings to be able to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they're carrying this particular
pathogen, which can easily be hidden at
[SPEAKER_00]: times, but show itself during times of
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another quick short video here,
a minute and 41 seconds, you're welcome to
[SPEAKER_00]: take a look at regarding the CDC's
tuberculosis transmission here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that was helpful in just
giving you two examples of diseases that
[SPEAKER_00]: exist that are able to evade the immune
system.
Thank you.
