[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBaco University video,
we're going to look at reducing fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats with the use of rice hulls.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go out in the greenhouse,
take a look at some of the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: take a look at the rice hulls themselves,
and then go through and show you a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that's recently been watered and how quick
it wicks away the water as a way to add a
[SPEAKER_00]: small little physical barrier on the
growing substrate to help you reduce a
[SPEAKER_00]: common problem through a very easy way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for a great way to
reduce fungus gnats, using rice hulls in
[SPEAKER_00]: your containers is one way to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally, as you can see in these
containers, we have a thin coating of
[SPEAKER_00]: these rice hulls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these rice hulls, what they simply do
to reduce those fungus gnats is by
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing the surface moisture in and
around the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: By simply breaking that moisture from
what's in the growing substrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're reducing that pressure of those
fungus gnats and therefore eliminating the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem through a physical means that
really is quite easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've never used rice hulls before,
you might be wondering what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just as you would imagine,
they're very thin, they're very light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not good who to apply to an outdoor on a
really windy day, but it's this thin and
[SPEAKER_00]: light property to them that allows them
not to hold a lot of water and then allows
[SPEAKER_00]: it to be very dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you don't need to put a ton of these
around your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just enough to cover that surface
because it's going to wick and dry and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the area below that can be wet and
moist for the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this top area being dry really is what
reduces your fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look here at our container,
we can see we just put just enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: cover that surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the plant here,
you can see that's the soil substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just enough of those rice hulls to cover
that to keep it nice and dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is really what is going to help
keep that moisture at a minimum and
[SPEAKER_00]: directly reduce your fungus gnats from
getting on your plants, even from the
[SPEAKER_00]: early growings of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now here we see a plant that was just
recently watered, a little hand watering
[SPEAKER_00]: of the small plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can already see those rice hulls
starting to dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some pockets here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still holding a little bit of
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this plant was just watered and
we're already seeing that water allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: percolate through, drying out those rice
hulls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great way you want to reduce
your chance of getting fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very simple way, simply adding
rice hulls.
OK, so that's it for this video.
Thank you so much for watching.
