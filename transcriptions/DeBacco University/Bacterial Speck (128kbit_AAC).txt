[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here I want to mention a little bit
about bacterial speck, which really looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like specks on the leaves, and while not
all that common in cannabis, it's worth
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioning and understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, not many have been
identified that cause issues with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: during the growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that bacteria, there are
beneficial ones, for example, in your
[SPEAKER_00]: intestines.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also some ones that may cause
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while they all may look like little
dots on a petri dish, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily mean they're all bad or
they're all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now where to look for bacterial speck
cultivars that specialize in fiber
[SPEAKER_00]: production tend to have some more
susceptibility to bacterial infections,
[SPEAKER_00]: so if you're growing one of those
cultivars, it may be worth having a little
[SPEAKER_00]: extra scout for this particular disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most commonly a grower will notice brown
leaf spots that may spread to the stem as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, as far as identifying
characteristics for bacterial speck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like little brown specks on the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, those fiber production cultivars
are ones to give a little bit of an extra
[SPEAKER_00]: eye out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to prevent it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you want to keep your conditions
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now clean does not mean necessarily
completely sterile clean where nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: will ever grow, but making sure that the
floor is swept, making sure the walls may
[SPEAKER_00]: be wiped down, there's no dead leaves
around, because bacteria can spread very
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly, especially in elevated
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keeping the area clean, you can really
prevent potentially a lot of chance for
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial infections on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to control it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of important to remember that
fungicides only work on fungi and will not
[SPEAKER_00]: work on bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxidate, which is a hydrogen peroxide
product, and copper are two examples of
[SPEAKER_00]: bactericides, meaning they actually will
control a bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have some fungicidal properties,
but these two in particular also work on
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you an idea what I want to talk
about these brown specks, this is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: an indication of what it might look like
on a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, bacteria, very different than
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, if you are noticing these
symptoms and want to apply a control
[SPEAKER_00]: product, don't waste your time with
fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the product you're using is in
some way a bactericide to help reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: spread and control of this bacteria from
spreading throughout your entire plant.
