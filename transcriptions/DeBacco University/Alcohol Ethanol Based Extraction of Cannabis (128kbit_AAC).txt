[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBacco University video,
I'm going to go over alcohol or
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol-based extraction of cannabis to
see if this is a method you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: considering for your operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go over alcohol or
ethanol-based extraction of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what's a general description
of this method?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cannabis is thoroughly soaked and
rinsed in 95 to 100% ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once all the ethanol has evaporated,
you are left with a dark tar-like
[SPEAKER_00]: substance rich in cannabinoids called the
full extract cannabinoid oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see the general process
represented here, kind of breaking down
[SPEAKER_00]: all the ethanol storage, ethanol vesicle,
and collecting vesicle occurring here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, though, as a reminder,
ethanol alcohol is a highly flammable
[SPEAKER_00]: solution, so again, use with caution.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does one of these actually look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed you kind of the general cartoon
image.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of showing the ethanol
machine used for extraction and
[SPEAKER_00]: distillation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bags of cannabis and ethanol can go right
in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see everything's kind of sealed and
locked down, computer controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very important to say cleanliness with the
process, very important to have control of
[SPEAKER_00]: the process, because as I said,
this is a flammable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the resulting end product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the final product of an
alcohol-based extraction is the full
[SPEAKER_00]: extract cannabis oil, a highly
concentrated whole plant extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: This extract can test anywhere from 80 to
99% cannabinoids, depending on the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of the extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol-based extraction can also be used
to make tinctures with the alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: solution filled with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another advantage of this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what are some other advantages?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, simply it's cost effective in large
amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol extraction can pull a broader
range of compounds from the plant than
[SPEAKER_00]: other extraction methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be performed at atmospheric
pressure, so it doesn't need anything
[SPEAKER_00]: really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do want to isolate it from any sort of
flame.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no risk of leaving toxic
residual chemicals in the final cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are part of the reasons why it can
become so popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, keep in mind, there are some
disadvantages with this method,
[SPEAKER_00]: and those do include the fact that there's
a possibility of chlorophyll in the final
[SPEAKER_00]: product, which could cause a little bit
more of a bitter taste to the end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethyl is a much higher boiling point than
other solvents, which could lead to a
[SPEAKER_00]: longer processing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post-processing is extensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several refinements must be made to the
extract before it's consumer ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be extremely dangerous,
as I mentioned, because it's a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: fire hazard, especially when used indoors
with potential other heating elements and
[SPEAKER_00]: just the storage of the material in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all those must be taken into
consideration if you're thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing this as part of your
operation as you look at methods to
[SPEAKER_00]: extract your cannabis product.
Thank you very much.
