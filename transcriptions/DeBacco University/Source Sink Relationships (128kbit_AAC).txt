[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this video is going to look at the
source and sink relationship that plants
[SPEAKER_00]: have to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So source being mainly leaves,
the sink in this case being the developing
[SPEAKER_00]: blackberry, and how these interrelate when
we look at plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first defining source and sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well source are portions of the plant that
are producing more energy, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: sugars, than they are consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sinks are net consumers of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our source, in this case a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Young leaves can be a sink, acorns in this
case can be a sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots can be a sink, and leaves are main
areas of source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember fully mature leaves are source
tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Young leaves can actually be a sink
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can be net consumers of energy
before they mature, then they can be net
[SPEAKER_00]: producers of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking again at some sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are typically green areas going
through the process of converting light
[SPEAKER_00]: energy to sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is then transported via the xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: These carbohydrates are assimilated into
storage, and they can go to roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: shoots, and fruits, and all other
components there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember entering the phloem that can go
up and down being transported to where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that transportation process here,
the carbohydrate transport is through a
[SPEAKER_00]: process what we call translocation,
and this is the movement of products of
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis by phloem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just put the picture of the train here
to get the idea of moving products,
[SPEAKER_00]: moving a lot of products throughout the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how translocation works, well we have
our source leaf here producing sucrose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Companion cells are loading it into the
phloem within our sieve tube elements,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then that is transported and moving
towards a sink cell where these companion
[SPEAKER_00]: cells are picking up those sucrose
molecules and adding them to the sink
[SPEAKER_00]: cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also notice when we increase our
concentration of sugar, water will move
[SPEAKER_00]: across.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we decrease our concentration of
sugar, water will move back to the xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic equation for the entire
photosynthetic process, again we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to spend a lot of time on that now,
that's coming up in future and other
[SPEAKER_00]: videos if you'd like to watch those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesis is carbon dioxide plus
water, utilizing light energy to form
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar and oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the reason why it's 6 CO2 plus 6 O2 in
light, producing a C6H12O6 sugar molecule
[SPEAKER_00]: plus 6 oxygen, is this balances the
equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the same number of carbon,
hydrogens, and oxygens on this side as
[SPEAKER_00]: there are on this side.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why the coefficients are necessary
here because we have this 6 carbon complex
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The process of including light energy to
produce chemical energy, in this case
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar, and that's what we're seeing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are refined sugars, cubes,
but you kind of get the idea of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesis in general is that capture
of light energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We notice that that can go through and
form starch or sugar storage organs in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of our tubers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used for starch, which is sugar
storage in an organ, a tomato in this
[SPEAKER_00]: case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see there's a lot of things
going on here, and this is how this
[SPEAKER_00]: source-sync relationship plays into the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just going from one area to
another, there's a lot of factors in play
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, sucrose is typically used
for long distance transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long distance transport of carbohydrates
is mainly in the phloem, it's mainly the
[SPEAKER_00]: form of sucrose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sucrose is a disaccharide of glucose and
fructose being linked together in long
[SPEAKER_00]: distance transport from a source cell all
the way to some sort of sync cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the strength of sugar attraction,
the ability of an organ to unload sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: from the phloem determines sync strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a sync cell, the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sync strength is how aggressive is that
going to be at grabbing sugars and pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: them from the phloem in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different sources are syncs, different
cells I should say are syncs, and the sync
[SPEAKER_00]: strength refers to the ability or the
aggressiveness of grabbing those sugars
[SPEAKER_00]: and pulling them towards themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maristems are the site of active dividing
cells forming new tissue and typically
[SPEAKER_00]: found in the growing tips of roots and
shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's apical and lateral maristems.
[SPEAKER_00]: These should look familiar from some of
the previous videos, and we'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: discussing them now and into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are examples of maristems that
require a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're typically sources of sync areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cell division drives the sync strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cell division will increase the sync size.
[SPEAKER_00]: The source-sync relationship will affect
the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you kind of show here with our big
apple and our little plant here,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to have a lot of sync strength
and that's going to drive a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: processes that the plant goes through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, remember our xylem and phloem,
they're vascular connections, xylem is
[SPEAKER_00]: moving water from the roots to the shoots
and phloem is moving mainly carbohydrates
[SPEAKER_00]: up and down in close proximity to
companion cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phloem, the vascular tissues transport
sugars to other metabolic products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can move materials up and down the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, as we see here, our sieve tube
elements and our companion cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are all involved in the phloem in
the movement of carbohydrates in other
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolic products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pressure phloem model, well sugar
enters the phloem via active transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actively adding our sucrose
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the sugar concentration increases,
water will enter the sieve tube cells from
[SPEAKER_00]: the xylem by osmosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the pressure will increase inside
this area and push the sugar through the
[SPEAKER_00]: phloem and sugar will move from the phloem
to a sink by the process of active
[SPEAKER_00]: transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice now that we're removing our
sugar, the water is moving back across.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, our xylem contains more than
just water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also minerals in the xylem and
that's what is helping drive the water
[SPEAKER_00]: movement through the process of osmosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phloem loading, this is the process
when sugars enter the phloem at a source
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some plants, sugar moves
sugar-producing cells into companion cells
[SPEAKER_00]: in the sieve tube elements via
plasmidismata, where these are holes in
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that here, companion cell moving
through the plasmidismata.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we call it symplastic phloem load.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is partially epoplastic phloem
loading.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some plants, this is where sugar moves
from sugar-producing cells into the
[SPEAKER_00]: epoplasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: ATP is required, you see that right here,
for active transport into the companion
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugar moves into the sieve tube cell
elements via transporter proteins via the
[SPEAKER_00]: plasmidismata.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're having those energy
required, that ATP being broken down to
[SPEAKER_00]: ADP to allow this to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both are accomplishing the sieve in the
same end result, where we're getting our
[SPEAKER_00]: sugars into the phloem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, certain insects will take advantage
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids in particular are notorious for
using a stylet, which is this kind of long
[SPEAKER_00]: piercing mouth part, as we see here,
to tap into the phloem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aphid cuts into the phloem,
allowing sap to easily be consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to consume the sugars that
are within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why they specifically have mouth
parts that penetrate the phloem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're what's called an insect,
they are phloem feeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just referring back, remember sugar is
carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbohydrates are saccharides.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many different types of sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sucrose is mostly used in the transport of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sucrose is formed when a monomer of
glucose and a monomer of fructose are
[SPEAKER_00]: joined together through the process of
dehydration synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dehydration is the root removal of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a hydroxide group and a hydrogen
ion, OH and H, come together to form
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dehydration, that's losing the water
molecule and creating this bond here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's allowing these two
monomers to be joined together to form
[SPEAKER_00]: sucrose, which is a disaccharide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, I think this image is pretty
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're noticing that cell growth is a
consequence of sugar import from the
[SPEAKER_00]: common simulant pool according to the
source-sink concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cell growth is a consequence of the
sugar import.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this radiograph here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this image shows is labeled sugar
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a concentration two and a half hours
after tracer molecules were fed to older
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went through initially and these
scientists added sugar molecules to older
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red areas indicate an area of high
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red color indicates high level of beta
particles and those sugars emit
[SPEAKER_00]: radioactivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this doesn't mean that all plants
are radioactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an example of scientists
labeling certain sugar molecules to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to help trace them and see where they
end up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key or take home message here is that
the concentration in young leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: the image indicates that these are fast
growing young leaves, drew the radioactive
[SPEAKER_00]: sugars from the older leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this indicates young leaves are
actually a sink cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pulling sugars from the older
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because it's a leaf doesn't mean
it's always a source cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Young leaves are developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually consuming more sugars
than they're initially producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, when these reach maturity,
they will produce more and become a source
[SPEAKER_00]: for the plant to allow it to be able to
store it in different sink cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those could be tubers, those could be
fruits, or other regions of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But initially, young leaves are actually a
sink before they fully develop.
Thank you.
