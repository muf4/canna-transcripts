[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to look at a question
that you may not have thought of that is
[SPEAKER_00]: how is light produced?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've all seen a rainbow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know why the colors are organized
the way they are or do you know even what
[SPEAKER_00]: generates the colors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this lecture will help explain a
little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting first with just what is light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Light does not require a medium like sound
to travel in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sound requires air to be able to travel
through and the air pressure differences
[SPEAKER_00]: are perceived by your eardrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The speed of light represented by the
letters C famous in the Eagles MC squared
[SPEAKER_00]: equation is about you could say roughly
300 million meters per second in the
[SPEAKER_00]: vacuum or that's about 670.6 million miles
per hour and of light we can only see
[SPEAKER_00]: what's called the visible spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to look at that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: To put this into perspective the speed of
light from the earth to moon is
[SPEAKER_00]: represented here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a scale model of the earth and the
moon with a beam of light traveling
[SPEAKER_00]: between them at the speed of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes approximately 1.6 seconds for
that beam of light to leave earth and go
[SPEAKER_00]: to the moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know what a great distance that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at light considered wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wavelengths defined as the distance
between two crests or two troughs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see here's a crest, here's a crest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be considered the wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a trough, here's a trough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it's shown here as a wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's measured in nanometers and different
wavelengths equal different wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to put this into perspective when
we're talking about nanometers the human
[SPEAKER_00]: hair or a single human hair is about
100,000 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking here at nanometers in the
400 to 700 range just to give you an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we look at the white light passing
through this prism we can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: different wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the red wavelengths on top here
having a much longer wavelength and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we see down we get to the violets and the
blues having a shorter wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I said that we can only see the
visible spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is that spectrum?
[SPEAKER_00]: That visible spectrum is this very small
portion of this entire electromagnetic
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've seen long radio waves,
microwaves, infrared rays, and then we're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting smaller and smaller in
wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here x-rays, gamma rays,
very damaging, very penetrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our visible light is only this very,
very small portion here and it's expanded
[SPEAKER_00]: in this region here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see 700 nanometers to about 400
nanometers is this spectrum or the portion
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though radio waves are going through
we can't see those microwaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: infrared, UV light, we can't see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can only see this very small portion,
what we call the visible spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So putting this into perspective,
moving energy levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at the atom again in our
energy levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order for an electron to move to energy
levels it either needs to gain or give off
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we can't create or destroy energy it
has to only be transferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ground state is the lowest energy
level and is located closest to the
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our example here this would be the
ground state here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our ground state and these energy
levels would represent different levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: excited states and increasing energy as we
get further away from the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So absorbing energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electrons can gain energy from heat,
electricity, or even other light sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: When an electron gains energy it jumps up
in energy levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an electron gaining energy,
jumping up an energy level.
[SPEAKER_00]: An electron that has gained energy will
enter what we call the excited state,
[SPEAKER_00]: then jumped up a level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where electrons can't exist in between,
they can only exist at different energy
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're gaining energy, jumping up
an energy level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really don't visually see anything
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: when this occurs, but that electron now is
what we call the excited state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on, when the electron releases
energy, the energy will be released as it
[SPEAKER_00]: jumps down a level as a photon and it
falls down closer to the ground state.
[SPEAKER_00]: The further the electron is from the
nucleus, the more energy it has.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see that example here where that
same electron is now losing energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's losing the same amount of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it's giving off as a photon of light,
which we can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's put that in a motion here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see an electron here giving off energy
that we can see jumping down an energy
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: When an electron gains energy,
it jumps up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see it's moving a little bit
quicker, the same thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gaining energy to what's called the
excited state.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it loses that energy, giving off a
photon of light, down here it's dropping
[SPEAKER_00]: to the ground state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that photon of light, each photon
matches a distinctive energy level jump
[SPEAKER_00]: with a specific wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our before, out of the excited
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: During we're dropping down an energy
level, giving off that photon of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on what energy levels it may
jump, will depend on the wavelength of
[SPEAKER_00]: light given off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's put that into an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have an electron at the third
energy level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to drop down to that second
energy level.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it drops down to that one level
there, it emits a red wavelength,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is 656 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's take an electron at the fourth
energy level and drop it down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: second energy level here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that will give off 486
nanometers, this kind of greenish color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for at the fifth energy level,
we drop that down, we see 434 nanometers,
[SPEAKER_00]: that purple spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's make an assumption here for at
the sixth energy level and drop down,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to be in this range here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see there's these different changes
in wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, if we're at the sixth
energy level, and we drop down,
[SPEAKER_00]: we develop more of this purple at 410
nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the different colors are
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on how the electrons are
jumping around, these different colors
[SPEAKER_00]: will blend together to a single color that
will proceed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this gives you a little bit of a
better idea of how light is produced.
Thank you.
