[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to another DeBaco University
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we have one on mitochondrial DNA and
its use in forensic science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we know DNA or the vast majority
of our DNA stored in the nucleus,
[SPEAKER_00]: we also have some in the mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that play into use in
forensics and where may that be useful
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at a crime scene?
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, mitochondrial DNA,
just the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitochondria does have some unique DNA
sequences to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's important to make note of is
that all these genes come only from your
[SPEAKER_00]: mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: A single mitochondria contains several
loops of DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in addition to the genes we
have located of course in the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitochondria found in all human cells and
they provide 90% of the energy that our
[SPEAKER_00]: body needs to function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each cell in our body contains hundreds or
thousands of mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about like a muscle cell,
it's going to be very high energy
[SPEAKER_00]: demanding that is more likely to have a
greater number of mitochondria than say a
[SPEAKER_00]: skin cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is mitochondria used in forensics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, nuclear DNA, if that has been
significantly degraded, this is where we
[SPEAKER_00]: could maybe look at finding and sequencing
and looking at mitochondrial DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if the nuclear DNA is present in
small quantities, that would lead us to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to the mitochondrial route where
authorities can obtain a reference sample
[SPEAKER_00]: from an individual who's long deceased or
missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are conditions where the
mitochondrial DNA might come into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this mitochondrial DNA, the
fingerprints associated with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's situations where authorities
cannot simply obtain a reference sample
[SPEAKER_00]: from a missing child.
[SPEAKER_00]: A mitochondrial DNA reference sample is
obtained from maternally related
[SPEAKER_00]: relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember only the mom's side.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mitochondrial DNA can be amplified
using a PCR from this chain reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that's going to tell us is kind
of an indication of is there a possibility
[SPEAKER_00]: of having a match there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because remember nuclear DNA is inherited
from all the ancestors and kind of passed
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitochondrial DNA is inherited in a single
lineage looking only at a person's
[SPEAKER_00]: maternal or mother line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it is a little limiting,
it can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be useful, especially if the entire
genome is in some way degraded or missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another link we can use to further
show the power of DNA associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: crime scenes.
