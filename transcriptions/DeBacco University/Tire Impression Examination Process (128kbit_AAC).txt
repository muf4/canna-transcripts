[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're going to look at tire
impressions and the examination process
[SPEAKER_00]: for those tires, being able to understand
the different types of tread and what to
[SPEAKER_00]: look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all going to be covered here in
this video lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with crime scene evidence
versus the known.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tire tread examinations compare tire
impressions recovered from the scene with
[SPEAKER_00]: tires taken from a known vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two categories of tires are the
suspect, the vehicle is suspected to have
[SPEAKER_00]: or be at the crime scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have vehicles we need to also
eliminate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are vehicles that could be the
police, ambulance or other sources for
[SPEAKER_00]: known purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All tires should be seized from the
suspect's vehicle to allow an adequate
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pictures should be taken here as we
see also with the indication of that
[SPEAKER_00]: what's read on the sidewall as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are class characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep in mind class characteristics can
be used to eliminate suspect's tire or
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest a tire could have made the track.
[SPEAKER_00]: These characteristics include the size,
the tread design and wear marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: These aren't individual characteristics,
you're just saying the same class or the
[SPEAKER_00]: same general type of tire could have made
those particular tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're looking at some of the
details here and this is why images and
[SPEAKER_00]: photographs from the scene can be so
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can lead to a visual comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tire impressions are a result of
transfer from tread detail, a tire against
[SPEAKER_00]: a substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case it could be kind of the sand,
could be the actual asphalt, could be
[SPEAKER_00]: snow, could be mud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Impressions can be made here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be two or three dimensional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forensics examinations can begin with
visual comparisons to eliminate tires
[SPEAKER_00]: which do not match the impressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way to kind of quickly
eliminate or quickly classify certain
[SPEAKER_00]: prints just by using the visual cues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Known tires collected should be inked and
have 3D impressions made for comparison
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind you want to look at the
entire tread, you don't want to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: small section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forensics examination continues with a
full circumference test of the
[SPEAKER_00]: impressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you kind of like ink the
tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to ink the entire circumference
of the tire, not just a small section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Impressions are superimposed on known
impressions overcast or the original tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to try to find consistencies
or a unique abnormality such as a point of
[SPEAKER_00]: damage or something caught in the tread to
try to match up that particular tire with
[SPEAKER_00]: being present at that part of the crime
scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: General tire evaluation, other factors
that should be investigated include the
[SPEAKER_00]: tread design.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be looking at the tread
dimensions and noise treatments,
[SPEAKER_00]: potential wear features, and random
individual characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, it could be a damage point
in the tire or potentially even a small
[SPEAKER_00]: stone caught in that tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that can lead us to the individual
characteristics that can help us kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: use to identify an exact tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, individual characteristics can
change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's important to try to get
the match to be as close as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have a refilling point,
a plug point, it could be a nail in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tire, it could be the different wear
marks, different cracks in the tire,
[SPEAKER_00]: or something kind of unique that is wedged
in that end rubber there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these are individual
characteristics and this can really help
[SPEAKER_00]: solidify an argument that that tire was
present at the particular scene that was
[SPEAKER_00]: documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintain an inked of the known standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where it's important to kind of
get that instead of the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: circumference of the tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use an inked surface that's longer
than the total circumference of the tire
[SPEAKER_00]: to ensure you get everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also have the surface to receive the ink
of equal or greater length.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the ink area, you want to make
sure you ink the entire tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have an area where you can
transfer that tread over the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the goal is to obtain a full
circumference inked impression for that
[SPEAKER_00]: tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have something called tread
blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are, tread designs are comprised
of tread blocks which vary in size to help
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: The arrangement never repeats and is
different on each side, which is why a
[SPEAKER_00]: full circumference impression is so
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you will have the manufacturers
have different dimensions for those tread
[SPEAKER_00]: blocks to help reduce overall noise of the
tire while it's being driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we want to offer comparison of the
ink to the cast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's advised to pass the ink pressure
directly over the cast to try to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: corresponding tread blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take that and kind of shift
it to see if you can get different areas
[SPEAKER_00]: to match up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a match is found, the specific tire
segment can be compared to the actual tire
[SPEAKER_00]: directly, which can really strengthen an
argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actual to cast tire comparison,
the blue tape is used to show the matching
[SPEAKER_00]: segment that the cast corresponds with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the cast, remember, is only going
to be a small portion of that tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're trying to determine,
well, where is it within that tire?
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you notice something unique either
in the cast, which would be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: harder to see, or the actual tire?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when you're looking at very closely,
looking at the visual, the photograph
[SPEAKER_00]: overlaid on top of the cast shows this
correlation where this stone placement is
[SPEAKER_00]: an exact match.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just go back for one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you can see that these stones caught
in the tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look very carefully,
you might get an indication of that stone
[SPEAKER_00]: also showing up on the cast.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you kind of overlay those two over
one another, it's very probable that this
[SPEAKER_00]: tire made the cast impression at the crime
scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it's very possible that with this
visual match that you have these
[SPEAKER_00]: individual characteristics that this kind
of stone here matches up with the cast and
[SPEAKER_00]: the original tire, indicating that it's
very likely or very probable that this
[SPEAKER_00]: tire made the cast impression found at the
crime scene.
