[SPEAKER_00]: On this DeBacco University video,
I'm going to go through an in-depth as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as a field look at anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to give you an anthocyanin
overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will also look at genetic regulation in
field observations of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, to give you a little bit of
the progression of information you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to find in this video, I'm going to
go over basically what are anthocyanins
[SPEAKER_00]: and provide you a basic background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the regulation of anthocyanin
biosynthesis, which gets into some new
[SPEAKER_00]: insight into gene regulation at the
molecular scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll go out in the field for an
early season and mid-season plant response
[SPEAKER_00]: to environmental stresses that cause it to
increase anthocyanin production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a macroscopic view of how most
growers will see or recognize
[SPEAKER_00]: anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll provide you with a outfield look at
some recently transplanted cannabis plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and care will provide you with a late
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: A vegetative growth anthocyanin look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, let's start with the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these basics always here on DeBacco
University try to be science-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is an article I can take a look
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn more about
anthocyanins, there'll be another one
[SPEAKER_00]: referred to as well in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, again, what are those
anthocyanins?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of what they look like at a
chemical structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anthocyanins are colored water soluble
pigments, which are a class of flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: In part, pigmentation of the plant parts
and play an important roles in plant
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These components and compounds can also
have medical benefits as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a couple of them kind of listed
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, these are found more than just
in cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberries as well as other fruits and
vegetables can express these as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there's just also more than one
anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberries contain five out of the six.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just missing one there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each has a different coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the color is influenced by the
pH, light, temperature, and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general though, anthocyanins are red in
acidic conditions and blue when the pH is
[SPEAKER_00]: increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you an idea of the general pH,
you can see all the very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, some of them are pH dependent,
can actually be used as an indicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that color changing complexities here,
color changes in response to pH variation
[SPEAKER_00]: of the anthocyanin This can be used as a
pH indicator and actually extracted from
[SPEAKER_00]: red cabbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, if you take red cabbage and put
it in a blender, and I take some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: water out, and then you add different pHs,
it'll actually change color right before
[SPEAKER_00]: your eyes and can, based on what color you
see, can indicate what pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put it in an acidic solution,
it'll turn more the pinkish reddish hues.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put it more in a slightly basic,
it'd be more of the purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put it in a more extreme basic,
it would be more of a yellowish yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fun experiment if you wanted to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get some red cabbage in a blender and
some degrees of acids and bases,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can literally see the color change as
an indicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: With anthocyanins, they also have
something called copigmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So copigmentation helps to stabilize the
color of the leaves, flowers, and fruits
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This increased color intensity can be due
to the copigmentation of anthocyanins and
[SPEAKER_00]: the flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a bit more of the detail here of
copigmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's metal ions that bind to the B ring
of the anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, aluminum binding changes the
anthocyanins from a red to blue color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some degree of complexity that
can be associated with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a low anthocyanin and a high
anthocyanin production.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is typically how growers are going to
recognize it by simply the degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: purple that they may see expressed in
their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now high temperature can also influence
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anthocyanins are less stable at higher
solution temperatures in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A previous study, the one that I showed
you, reports a heat treatment at a maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: of 35 degrees Celsius reduced the total
anthocyanin content in the common grape to
[SPEAKER_00]: less than half the amount in control
berries that were kept at 25 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're talking about stability of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anthocyanins, if you increase the
temperature too much, can have that
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction there in total concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now heat and anthocyanins in the extract
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're looking at these, heat
treatment of an anthocyanin in a rich
[SPEAKER_00]: extract solution may not cause a
degradation of anthocyanin pigments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important here that we're looking
at now the extract of the solution here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because the extract commonly
contains phenolic compounds that are
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymatically degraded by phenyl oxidase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this example, mild heat of the
extract to up to 50 degrees Celsius has
[SPEAKER_00]: been shown to inactivate the enzymatic
reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without the denaturing of the enzyme,
the anthocyanin can be preserved despite
[SPEAKER_00]: the increase in temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because if the anthocyanins are
being broken down by an enzyme,
[SPEAKER_00]: if that enzyme has the wrong shape and it
can't perform its function, therefore it's
[SPEAKER_00]: denatured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because the enzyme can no longer
break down the anthocyanin, they can be
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to greater temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of like an interesting fact
there when we're talking about the extract
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the actual in the plant
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we're looking at extracting
anthocyanins, this can get quite
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated here, but organic solvents,
typically methanol and ethanol,
[SPEAKER_00]: are considered as generally safe
extraction medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isolation of anthocyanins using
water-based extraction though is a lex
[SPEAKER_00]: toxic procedure and when it's being
implemented a little bit more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sub-critical water-based extraction
uses acidified water with hydrochloric
[SPEAKER_00]: acid to a pH of about 2.3 that is subject
to high temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: High temperatures we're looking at between
110 and 160 degrees Celsius under a
[SPEAKER_00]: constant pressure of 40 bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a highly effective technique for
extracting anthocyanins from fruit and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see it does require some equipment,
but really offers the greatest extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of this particular compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now separation of anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, anthocyanins are extracted from
plants as a crude mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that reason, separation or isolation
of specific types of anthocyanin is needed
[SPEAKER_00]: for a specific purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Separation and identification of
anthocyanins can be done via various
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatic methods here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just kind of a example here HPLC,
high pressure liquid chromatography,
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid chromatography mass spec,
NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different methods and
that kind of will depend what might be
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at separating or what degree of
specificity you might need, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: qualitative or a quantitative method as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now getting in more into the biosynthesis,
so if you want to learn a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: about the gene regulation here,
this is a relatively new published article
[SPEAKER_00]: that just came out, really gets into some
of the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not for the, you know, the grower
morphological macroscopic view,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really this is kind of a breakthrough
that's going to help us out with the bio
[SPEAKER_00]: gene regulation of anthocyanin production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So transcription factors, the molecular
basis of anthocyanin biosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis sativa remains elusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, for this reason, research still
provides information regarding the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory genes of anthocyanin
biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be useful for biotechnological
improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though this is just kind of like a
little bit of a glimpse, a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: an insight, this could potentially be the
research that perpetuates this going
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why do we want to look at a
transcription factor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Transcription factors and what are
transcription factors?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're basically proteins involved in the
process of converting or transcribing DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: into RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have genetic codes in our genes and
then those DNA goes to RNA and that RNA is
[SPEAKER_00]: a messenger RNA that will then get made
into a protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So transcription factors include a wide
number of proteins, excluding RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: polymerase that initiate and regulate the
transcription of genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a really simple way to think about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it, it's an on-off switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The description factor determines whether
that gene is made or that protein is
[SPEAKER_00]: produced or whether that is turned off
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it occurs at the molecular
level, but it's a simple on-off
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, make that protein or no, do not make
that protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why look at transcription factors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're important for gene
regulation and also cell signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: One distinct feature of transcription
factors is that they have DNA binding
[SPEAKER_00]: domains that give them the ability to bind
to specific sequences of DNA called
[SPEAKER_00]: enhancer or promoter sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that promoter region would be the area
that could be the light switch turned on
[SPEAKER_00]: or turned off.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, this will have a direct
impact on the expression or the
[SPEAKER_00]: suppression of this particular gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see here if there's an enhancer,
it's going to allow this to kind of go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and progress and allow that
protein to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if there's a silencer or a suppressor,
that's going to prevent that or stop that,
[SPEAKER_00]: act as a wall, a barrier, turn that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, our bodies don't want to make
everything all the time, so this is
[SPEAKER_00]: important to have this regulation,
but here we're looking at it specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: for this anthocyanin biosynthesis process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within that, there is the MYB,
MYB family of transcription factors,
[SPEAKER_00]: the MYB transcription factors,
abbreviated TFs if I use that,
[SPEAKER_00]: preceding this, as one of the largest gene
families in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get its name from the myoblast,
came from the first identification of
[SPEAKER_00]: these, which was in avian oncogenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting background there.
[SPEAKER_00]: 203 identified MYB family transcription
factors have been found in eukaryotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they do play important roles in
biological processes, well beyond what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to look at here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Including plant growth, plant cell
morphology, pattern building,
[SPEAKER_00]: physiological activity, primary and
secondary metabolite reactors,
[SPEAKER_00]: responses to environmental stresses,
you can see involved in a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This family of transcription factors plays
a vital role in regulating anthocyanin
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, 99 R2, R3 MYB genes have been
identified in the cannabis sativa genome
[SPEAKER_00]: alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at an example here of
Arabidopsis, but we're looking now at this
[SPEAKER_00]: article really making it more specific to
the cannabis sativa plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are these R2, R3 MYB genes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we looking at them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other previous researchers did confirm
that the ES MYB F1 as a flavonoid-specific
[SPEAKER_00]: regulator, which participated in the
biosynthesis regulation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavonoid-derived bioactive components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is looking at kind of that
genetics, which I know can look a little
[SPEAKER_00]: confusing if you're not used to looking at
charts like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just think of this as the genetic
sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at the genes, the coding,
the recipes to make certain proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these transcription factors are widely
involved in the secondary metabolites of
[SPEAKER_00]: organic acids in medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been found that these R2,
R3 MYB transcription factors, the fourth
[SPEAKER_00]: subfamily, are involved in metabolism of
the phenolparanoid as a negative regulator
[SPEAKER_00]: in various medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: In short, we're in that gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can choose to upregulate or
downregulate certain genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've kind of identified that
marker according to this published study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anthocyanins regulators are identified
based on the phenology, as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: expression profiling of genes in two areas
here of the cannabis sativa, differing in
[SPEAKER_00]: the content of anthocyanin pigmentation in
the sugar leaves, two punitive regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: of anthocyanin biosynthesis named as a CS
MYB 3.3 and CS MYB 3.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: 7, 8 were identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're identifying specific
regions within the cannabis plant based on
[SPEAKER_00]: this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can really be utilized now to
start to target or look for certain
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can definitely see that image B has
more of that purple anthocyanin
[SPEAKER_00]: upregulation than does plant A here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they looked at similar plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were looking at the transit
overexpression of these in leaves of a
[SPEAKER_00]: close relative of tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as comparison, it was found that they
were stronger in terms of activation of
[SPEAKER_00]: the anthocyanin biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at the certain genes,
looking at a cross comparison here,
[SPEAKER_00]: developing that analog there for
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely seeing this in
derivatives of cultivated tobacco,
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing that increased expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think just on the pictures alone,
you can see that higher degree of purple
[SPEAKER_00]: coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: That enhanced anthocyanin pigmentation in
the leaves as well as the sepals,
[SPEAKER_00]: the transgenic lines there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to modify those genes and we
are seeing that proof of concept with that
[SPEAKER_00]: increased purple coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great information, but there is
still limited knowledge about the
[SPEAKER_00]: structural and functional attributes of
the R2, R3 MYBs in cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that they are found in other
plants as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to understand specifically in
the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know there's a lot of background
information there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does this actually help a grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: After this in-depth investigation about
anthocyanins, and hopefully you've tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: in this long, most growers recognize this
as a purple coloration to their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often this is a result of an environmental
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show you two examples of this
plant response.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be out in the field early
season showing you plant shock,
[SPEAKER_00]: showing increased anthocyanin pigmentation
in the main stem of recently transplanted
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Keir is going to show us increased
anthocyanin production on leaf petioles,
[SPEAKER_00]: indicated right here, due to a sudden
increase in light exposure due to removal
[SPEAKER_00]: of a nearby plant's shading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you've enjoyed this kind of
like background look, detailed new genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now let's go out in the field where we
can also see this comparison of different
[SPEAKER_00]: plants with different anthocyanin levels
of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now many growers may think this is a
phosphorus deficiency when they first look
[SPEAKER_00]: at it, because they're seeing the purple
coloration of the stem and also the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this just may be a simple transplant
shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants about two weeks in the ground here,
and you can see that knowing the soil test
[SPEAKER_00]: has adequate amount of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times it gets misdiagnosed as
a phosphorus deficiency, when in actuality
[SPEAKER_00]: this might be simply a stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I continue to say that if
you look at some of the newer growth
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the top here, you're noticing that
it's green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, there is some still stress kind
of towards the edge, but it's a way the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant can produce what's called
anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those anthocyanins shade it from the sun
because it is out here in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this might be just a perfect example of
a little plant stress that is not a
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today we're outside investigating this
purpling on one of our cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_01]: stocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason that this occurred in the first
place is that right where the camera was,
[SPEAKER_01]: there used to be a much taller cannabis
plant growing, providing constant shade to
[SPEAKER_01]: this side of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But suddenly because of bunny damage,
it got taken down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in result, this plant received much
more light on this side than it was
[SPEAKER_01]: typically used to, resulting in this
purpling pigment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a sunburn, but for a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could tell it's a sunburn because
it doesn't occur on the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just where the light hits the stem
that it has this purple pigmentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The anthocyanin come out and create this
purple pigment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what causes sometimes purpling
within the stems of your cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why it's called anthocyanin.
