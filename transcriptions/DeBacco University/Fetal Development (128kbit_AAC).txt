[SPEAKER_00]: Here you can see a summary of fetal
development and day one to day 22 to the
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens in the stages of the
development of a fetus are very well
[SPEAKER_00]: understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been tracked a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some key things that occur at
different weeks of development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is just kind of a zoomed in view
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I welcome to pause the video and take a
look and see how the different kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stages that go through three and a half
weeks to seven and a half weeks to eight
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half weeks all the way to 30 to 32
weeks where we're getting just before
[SPEAKER_00]: birth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now typically you may, if you know someone
who's been pregnant, you may define it as
[SPEAKER_00]: a trimester or the week or the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of gives you that idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically we have our first or second and
our third trimester.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first trimester is month one to three,
then four to six for the second trimester
[SPEAKER_00]: and seven to nine for the third and final
trimester.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the week breakdown there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be helpful to try to understand
exactly what's going on and when.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the fourth week,
again we're in that first trimester,
[SPEAKER_00]: formation of the body organs occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of what we look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a critical time for development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just four weeks in, we're talking very
small, embryos only about five
[SPEAKER_00]: millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, not five centimeters, five
millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is important, this critical time
of development of organs for babies that
[SPEAKER_00]: may have suffered from fetal alcohol
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, expecting mothers may not have
known that they were carrying a child at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point and they can consume alcohol
and that can cause some of these facial
[SPEAKER_00]: features and deformities to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's important if you're
looking at conceiving a child very early
[SPEAKER_00]: on to be mindful, especially expecting
mothers, of their diet because things you
[SPEAKER_00]: do very early on when you may not even
know that you're pregnant can have
[SPEAKER_00]: significant impacts in this, at this
point, your unborn child.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the second month a great change is
of morphology occur and shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a little bit more of a
defining characteristic.
[SPEAKER_00]: These limbs are assuming the adult shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Major internal organs are also evident.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the embryo is reaching 25 millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So still very small, still very small in
the great scheme of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of what they look like in a
real-world image.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of, you could see the
somewhat human characteristics starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: take hold here in only the second month.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third month development is essentially
complete except for the lungs and the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see definitely the fingers are
starting to become very clearly to be seen
[SPEAKER_00]: in the ear, the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, during the third month,
developing human is now called a fetus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This carries out primitive reflexes like
sucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be seen on some ultrasounds
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, during the second
trimester, it's a time of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bone formation occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bodies are covered in very, very fine hair
and by the end of the sixth month the
[SPEAKER_00]: fetus is about 30 centimeters or about a
foot long at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that growth is really exponential and
evident during the second trimester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly here, the third trimester,
pace of growth accelerates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weight of the fetus more than doubles as
nutrients are still provided by the
[SPEAKER_00]: mother's blood via the placenta.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most major nerve tracks are formed in the
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of that 4D, kind of 3D image
here that you can see is becoming a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real time so you could actually see
movement and it's just a static image.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see movement giving, expecting
mothers and fathers a very good definition
[SPEAKER_00]: of their unborn child and also allowing
doctors to be able to look at and
[SPEAKER_00]: determine if there's any major deformities
or reasons for concern that are occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: before birth.
