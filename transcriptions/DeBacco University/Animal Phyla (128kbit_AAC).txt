[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look at some of
the details in the animal phyla.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see everything from sponges,
to cnidarians, to whales, to sea stars,
[SPEAKER_00]: to worms, all fit into this very large and
diverse phyla that we might be most
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first off, looking at the general
features of animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can kind of fit myself in the mix
here, kind of put myself right there,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I do qualify, as do all humans
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So animals are heterotrophs, meaning they
do not make their own food, they need to
[SPEAKER_00]: consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants and autotrophs are the ones that
would make their own food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animals do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: A multi-cell there, so they have a
mitochondria, but lack a cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, animal cells can be quite
flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can move from place to place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're diploid, they have diverse forms
and habitats, as we can just see from the
[SPEAKER_00]: image here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reproduced mostly by sexual reproduction,
have a common pattern of development,
[SPEAKER_00]: and have unique tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So general features of animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Invertebrates account for 99% of all
species in the animal kingdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most occur, actually, in the sea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three phyla dominate animal life on Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arthropodia, mollusks, and chordates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we may think of our most favorite
animals, or what we think is the most
[SPEAKER_00]: common, arthropodia is by far the
greatest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And invertebrates account for 99% of all
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be mindful of that, of how that
1%, those vertebrates, those chordates,
[SPEAKER_00]: are a very, very small total amount of
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the family tree,
animals consist of 35 very different
[SPEAKER_00]: phyla.
[SPEAKER_00]: Textiles traditionally have compared
anatomical features.
[SPEAKER_00]: The end result, though, is phylogenies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at the domain kingdom
phylum class order family genus and
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're looking at the phyla level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking here, kind of at this bar
here, and we're looking at being more
[SPEAKER_00]: specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all animals, in this case, are in the
kingdom animalia and are all in the domain
[SPEAKER_00]: eukaryote.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at separating out that phyla
to be a little bit more specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within this animal family tree here,
the traditional animal phylogy is being
[SPEAKER_00]: revised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molecular systemics, systematics,
we should say, uses unique gene sequences
[SPEAKER_00]: to detect relatedness and construct
phylogenetic trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting away from the phenotypic
features and getting more into the
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypic features.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, this has created new
divisions and new ways to divide different
[SPEAKER_00]: things to really see what is connected,
looking at the genetics of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the current look here, we can kind of
see our having tissues or no tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be our common ancestor way
down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: No tissues going off to the left,
tissues going off to the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything here including or having
tissues, sponges or periphera,
[SPEAKER_00]: not including tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within there, we can have radial symmetry
or bilateral symmetry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at a whole bunch of
different other ways to divide things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's animals molt, they have protostrom
development or deutostrom development,
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways, again, to kind of separate
things and classify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, the cladogram with key branch
points, this gives you another idea of a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to break things apart, looking at
having vertebrae or having jaws or lungs
[SPEAKER_00]: or forelimbs or legs or amniotic egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would things be separated and what
would be considered to be more complex?
[SPEAKER_00]: So while this is a very diverse phylum
that we might be familiar with,
[SPEAKER_00]: this hopefully makes it a little bit
easier to at least associate some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: physical features when we're looking at
developing branch points within that phyla.
