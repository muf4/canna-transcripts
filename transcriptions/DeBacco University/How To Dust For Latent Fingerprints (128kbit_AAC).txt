[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm going to outline how you would
dust for latent fingerprints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind latent prints are ones
you can't initially visually see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a word of caution when you're going
through this process of identifying these
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of hidden prints is that it can be
messy, but also a fun process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a challenge to clean this very fine
powder because it does need to get into
[SPEAKER_00]: all those little porous surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get it in areas you don't want
it, it's very hard to clean from those
[SPEAKER_00]: surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep your working area small
and try to work on paper or a tray surface
[SPEAKER_00]: when possible to make cleanup a lot easier
and keep things organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want it looking like the holy
festival of colors when we're working with
[SPEAKER_00]: these powders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dusting and lifting prints from glass
or plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, you want to make the print.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to make a quality thumbprint on the
glass or plastic surface, you want to rub
[SPEAKER_00]: your thumb usually against your forehead
to help ensure there's enough oils
[SPEAKER_00]: present, especially if you just recently
washed your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to press with moderate
pressure in a linear vertical motion on
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't press too hard or roll or smear your
print.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just remember, you can also clean the area
and try again.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of students sometimes try too hard
initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just kind of want to, for example,
with the glass, just grab it like you
[SPEAKER_00]: normally would and odds are you're going
to be transferring just enough there of
[SPEAKER_00]: oils without ruining the print.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then for dusting and lifting the prints on
this glass or plastic surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: option one is use a magnetic powder and a
brush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pick up, it's called a beer of magnetic
dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of this little area here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does look like a beard in dust while
keeping the plunger of the brush pushed
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to have it hang from the
bottom of the brush as we kind of see
[SPEAKER_00]: example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see the person going and doing
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to gently brush the hang dust
particles over the latent print.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to smear the print.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have too much pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just want to just very lightly go over it
because if you have too much force or use
[SPEAKER_00]: a plastic brush coming in contact with the
print, you're going to damage the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: print.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to pick up the loose and
excessive dust and put it back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: original container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind, it does take very little
dust to accomplish this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Option two would be using just regular
dust powder in a brush, which is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: follow very much a similar method,
except here you're going to dip the brush
[SPEAKER_00]: lightly into a container of powder and
then tap off the extra into the lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to use only a very small amount
of powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to dust the print.
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes with kind of some experience,
but if you're starting out, use less than
[SPEAKER_00]: you think is what would be my suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to lightly swirl the brush over
the print and rotate between your thumb
[SPEAKER_00]: and fingers, careful not to smear the
print.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, use the brush to remove any excess
powder that you may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you'll be able to see the print
become visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dusting, lifting prints from glass or
surface, you want to then lift the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: print.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great, you've gone through,
you've dusted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've created a wonderful print.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see a whole kind of hand print.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see an identified fingerprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we lift that print?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get it off of the surface?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to acquire a piece of tape that's
larger than the print.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start by sticking a portion near the print
and then smooth it over the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: print.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're kind of causing a fixing in one
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're smearing it over that print and the
goal is not to have it shift or move.
[SPEAKER_00]: This smoothing action is smearing over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have a consistent and even
contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after it's fixed, as we can see here,
we want to slowly peel the tape off the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stick it to a clean flat piece of paper
surface for inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to have that ready ahead of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you immediately lift it off,
you're immediately going right to your
[SPEAKER_00]: paper on that clean and flat surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dusting for fingerprints, if you're on
paper, just one example here, touch your
[SPEAKER_00]: thumb to your forehead and press it on a
piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't see the print, don't worry
because these are latent prints.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of students will kind of make the
print on the paper and then try to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for it and see if they can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you won't be able to see
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are latent prints.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to dust and lift following the
same method and procedure on the previous
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of example.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a glass and plastic surface,
the same applies to paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it correctly, you can get a
print that looks very much like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this does allow for a lot of ability
to go through and identify what type of
[SPEAKER_00]: print it is, but also see some of the very
specific classifications with that print
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to see if you have a match
between two prints.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this was helpful in going
through and knowing how to dust for latent fingerprints.
