[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at harvesting tomatoes
and hopefully you all have a bountiful
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest like this grower is having here on
How we're gonna go about how we can go
[SPEAKER_00]: about harvesting them and when will we go
about harvesting them?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this whole harvesting comes down to the
rule number one is that your first tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: will always take longer than you think But
once you get that first one the rest come
[SPEAKER_00]: right after it seems like So harvesting
tomatoes, well, what's your market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking at CSAs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking at Farmer's markets
looking at chefs demanding them that can
[SPEAKER_00]: determine how frequently or how often you
go through and harvest your tomatoes You
[SPEAKER_00]: want to watch the weather though if it's
rain in the forecast You may want to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest a day early one to get in the
field But also to reduce the chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: cracking of their tomatoes very common
with some cherries mixed colors and
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties can be Very attractive when you
put them in a quart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may want to harvest not all one
variety might do a mix Sometimes there's
[SPEAKER_00]: you pick up Operations for to reduce the
labor of harvesting in particular cherry
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes For larger tomatoes, can you sell
yellow tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they need to be red?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they want to be striped?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's going to depend on what
market you're selling to and on larger
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes Well, how big is too big?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a certain size people won't buy
they don't want to spend that much on one
[SPEAKER_00]: single tomato again something to consider
for your individual market Something some
[SPEAKER_00]: growers don't know about when harvesting
tomatoes is called the breaker stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very common late in the Season
this is the break in color on the tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: will ripen from so when we see that kind
of very hinting kind of pinkish Different
[SPEAKER_00]: color towards the blossom end so it's
called the breaker stage You see this
[SPEAKER_00]: speck of pink at the blossom end This
means your tomatoes reach the breaker
[SPEAKER_00]: stage and you can harvest it at that time
And it may take a little bit longer than
[SPEAKER_00]: you like but it will eventually ripen to a
red color So important like I said late in
[SPEAKER_00]: the season or we're dealing with a frost
coming Down potentially ruining the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of your crop and go through and harvest
what's called the breaker stage in beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomatoes and eventually if stored in the
area above freezing they will eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: turn red So just a little helpful hint
there when you're going through and
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting or determining when to harvest
your tomatoes You You
