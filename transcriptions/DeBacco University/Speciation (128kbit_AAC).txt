[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to provide just a brief
overview of four different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: speciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of the quick general
overview, a good way to kind of go back
[SPEAKER_00]: and review allopatric, peripatric,
peripatric, and sympatric speciations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the quick, easy definitions
here, and we'll provide you with some
[SPEAKER_00]: visuals to help allow you to understand
these a little bit better, which will help
[SPEAKER_00]: you describe certain situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll start with the first one,
allopatric speciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a result of a geographic isolation
or a geographic barrier that results in
[SPEAKER_00]: complete reproductive isolation and
creates no gene flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this very predominant physical
structure, could be a geographical
[SPEAKER_00]: isolation, could be a mountain range,
for example, causing reproductive
[SPEAKER_00]: isolation, causing different species in
this case because of no gene flow crossing
[SPEAKER_00]: between these.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the green and blue species
developing completely separate from one
[SPEAKER_00]: another with no gene flow interacting
between those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the peripatric speciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where geographic isolation results
in reproductive isolation of only
[SPEAKER_00]: peripheral populations, which does result
in isolated gene flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a subset of this
population that's then kind of separated
[SPEAKER_00]: out, and we see that's developing its own
isolated gene flow to the original
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this geographic isolation occurs only
for these kind of peripheral populations,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of broke off, and here we see
development of the blue and the green
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on, we have a peripatric
speciation, which is a result of
[SPEAKER_00]: geographic isolation resulting in partial
reproductive isolation, which results in
[SPEAKER_00]: limited gene flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see the original population,
it's different across kind of combination,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see a gradient almost developing,
we see a favorite to some huge here for
[SPEAKER_00]: the blue genes and here for the green,
and we have this limited gene flow to
[SPEAKER_00]: result in our two different species here,
the blue and the green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, here we have sympatric speciation,
which is genetic overlap that results in
[SPEAKER_00]: no reproductive isolation, which does
result in gene flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our original population,
we have our population within a
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, gene flow is easily able to
happen with no reproductive isolation,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we can get the development of these
species, but this population originated
[SPEAKER_00]: within the original, and there is gene
flow because there is overlap that is
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring between these two different
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that gives you just a quick general
rundown of speciation and allow you to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain what may occur in certain
situations.
Thank you.
