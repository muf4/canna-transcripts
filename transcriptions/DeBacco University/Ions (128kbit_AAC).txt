[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we're going to look and review
ions and exactly what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to spend a little time on this
slide right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a neutral hydrogen atom.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not an ion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got one proton, one electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: One positive charge, one negative charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, one proton, one electron,
its net charge would be zero, be neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this notation would just be hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if that hydrogen loses an electron,
it is going to become positive because it
[SPEAKER_00]: has one positive proton, no negative
charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, it takes on a positive one
charge being noted as H plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was what we would call a cation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a positive ion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contrast to that, we have our neutral
hydrogen atom here and we add an electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have two electrons in one
proton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have one positive charge and two
negative charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: The net charge on this would be a negative
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be H negative is how to be
noted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be called an anion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a negative ion there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at this a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the same slide I showed you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an ion is an atom or group of atoms
that has a net positive or negative
[SPEAKER_00]: charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, an ion referring to something
that has a charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neutral would just be called an atom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Atoms can gain or lose electrons to form
ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: An ion is an atom with a charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your kind of take home summary
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recall that atoms are neutral in charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If an electron is lost, the overall charge
is positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if an electron is gained, an atom
becomes negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially this does confuse students.
[SPEAKER_00]: Losing an electron becomes positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: An electron, keep in mind, is a negative
charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: For losing a negative charge, the overall
charge therefore is positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes you think of it the other
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If an electron is gained, the atom is
gaining a negative charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's itself going to become negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that in our example here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing on the title slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now ions and atomic radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at atomic radius here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When electrons are lost, the radius
becomes smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: When electrons are gained, the radius
becomes larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see our ions is the dark gray here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're losing an electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, if we're losing an electron,
the radius becomes smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium, which is represented by K plus
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's neutral atom would be this large blue
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it loses the electron, the radius
becomes smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's smaller radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contrast to that here are non-metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take chlorine for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neutral atom here is that kind of canister
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gains, the radius becomes larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gaining an electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ion, that negative ion, that anion
here is larger than the neutral atom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how our atomic radius changes
based on the ion that these elements may
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Showing how that may look here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Positive cation formation when an atom
loses electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radius always becomes smaller because the
loss of a valence electron can leave an
[SPEAKER_00]: empty outer orbital resulting in a smaller
radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electrostatic repulsion decreases,
allowing the electrons to be pulled closer
[SPEAKER_00]: to the radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that look here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here our outer shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The valence electron has one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We remove that electron, creating a plus
one charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see just visually right here,
there's a change in a reduction in the
[SPEAKER_00]: radius of that particular atom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that here for kind of giving a
group one, group two, and group 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: How the ion in red is smaller than the
neutral atom represented in gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see how those trends occur here in
the Pyrrhic table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing on, if we have a negative ion
or an anion formation, when atoms gain
[SPEAKER_00]: electrons, the radius always increases,
which is sometimes contrary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, well, why does this occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: More electrons mean more electrostatic
repulsion resulting in an increase in the
[SPEAKER_00]: diameter here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have more negative charges out here,
there's a negative one, more electrons out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of just more space that they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore, the radius and an anion,
the negative charge, will increase over
[SPEAKER_00]: the neutral atom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that trend developed here also in
the Pyrrhic table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the neutral atom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's our ions that are forming
in blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see overall all of those are larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The anions are larger radius than their
neutral atoms.
