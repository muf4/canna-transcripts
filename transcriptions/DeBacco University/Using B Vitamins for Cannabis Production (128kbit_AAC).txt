[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're considering using B vitamins
for your cannabis plants suggest you watch
[SPEAKER_00]: this tobacco University video to see if
it's a right option for you All right,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's get into using B vitamins for
cannabis production well first off I have
[SPEAKER_00]: a reference article here if you're
wondering where I got some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: information from Links provided here first
page is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're welcome to investigate it first
Further this is just going to be a brief
[SPEAKER_00]: overview So starting off with just B
vitamins often associated with improved
[SPEAKER_00]: root formation However, this has not been
proven to be the case as in the original
[SPEAKER_00]: studies the B vitamins were mixed with
auxins It was actually the auxins that
[SPEAKER_00]: were actually responsible for the increase
in root growth So it kind of was
[SPEAKER_00]: associated that those B vitamins in there
improved root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really if you look at these original
studies They're looking at the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: auxins were added and really the auxins
were doing the actual root formation not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily the B vitamins so adding B
vitamins the additional of B vitamins is
[SPEAKER_00]: not advised simply because plants in the
field can produce their own thiamine in
[SPEAKER_00]: addition So it can so can many fungi and
bacteria that live in the root zone So
[SPEAKER_00]: even though the plants mean need it or
benefit from it in their root zone There's
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of microbes that can produce it for
the plants to reduce transplant shock and
[SPEAKER_00]: root formation Create a supportive
environment for the plants by adding an
[SPEAKER_00]: auxin product that may be incorporated and
is suggested over adding B vitamins
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's really where the
Improvements were occurred in those
[SPEAKER_00]: original studies So where to add B
vitamins, you know, are they applicable
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're involved with the kind of
tissue culture process of cannabis then
[SPEAKER_00]: the use of B vitamins particularly
thiamine can play an important role But
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a limited case that most growers
do not participate in because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: general difficulty that cannabis presents
with the tissue culture propagation
[SPEAKER_00]: process in general so other than that B
vitamins would be utilized and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: some degree if you're growing actual
plants from seeds or clones Really not
[SPEAKER_00]: advised that B vitamins focus more on a
protective and supportive growing
[SPEAKER_00]: environment And if you want to encourage
root formation probably seek auxins over
[SPEAKER_00]: the addition of B vitamins You You
