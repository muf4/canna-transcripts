[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to a video lecture on the
biosphere by me, Mr. DeBacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be remembering from such films as
the Ecological Organization because this
[SPEAKER_00]: video lecture picks up right where that
one left off with the biosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this slide may look familiar if you
watched that previous video lecture,
[SPEAKER_00]: but let's start here with the biosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the biomes together with marine
and freshwater included.
[SPEAKER_00]: The earth has four major connected
systems, which we are going to go over in
[SPEAKER_00]: detail here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The atmosphere, the ecosphere,
the hydrosphere, and lithosphere all
[SPEAKER_00]: coming together to form the biosphere,
which is a portion of earth that's
[SPEAKER_00]: inhabited by life, including all biotic
and abiotic parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the hydrosphere,
all of earth's water, ice, and water vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: is all included in the hydrosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oceans account for about 96.5% of the
water, although that is salt water,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's found in the oceans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freshwater is the remaining 3%,
and that may be locked up in glaciers and
[SPEAKER_00]: ice caps or in groundwater or surface and
other freshwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: This surface and other freshwater is
mainly the accessible component that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have, and most of that is composed of
ground ice, permafrost, or lakes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The freshwater distribution, as you can
notice here, it's a very limiting
[SPEAKER_00]: resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ice is about 1.762%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Groundwater is the next most abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surface freshwater contains a very small
percentage of the total hydrosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Atmosphere and soil is even a smaller
percentage than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why the world is so concerned with
not only the amount of water we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really the amount of freshwater we
have access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the vast majority locked up in
oceans, which is salt water, which is not
[SPEAKER_00]: really usable for both human consumption
and also to grow plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The oceans and ice, what bodies of water
hold the largest amount of water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's the oceans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are our largest bodies of water on
Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they contain salt water only.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see all the major oceans here,
the Arctic at the top, Atlantic,
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacific.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our Indian Ocean here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have all of these areas,
but they're very large, but however,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is all salt water, not really usable
on most forms by a lot of our
[SPEAKER_00]: terrestrial-based life forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on, we have oceans and ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So icebergs, they're large pieces of
freshwater or ice flowing in open waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 90% of icebergs is below the surface
of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it comes back to the Titanic here,
and satellite ran into an iceberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very small portion of the total iceberg
is actually exposed above the water that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vast majority is located beneath the
water surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes them very dangerous for travel in
boats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing with the ice, we also have
glaciers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any large mass of ice that moves
slowly over land?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, we're seeing a lot of the glaciers
that are being reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the evidence of where the
glacier line was here in 1985,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this picture was taken in 2003,
how much it's receded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, images of the same area taken in
different years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the great receding are
suddenly melting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The freshwater locations is surface water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the difference between a
watershed and a river basin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, both terms are used to describe land
that drains into a river, stream,
[SPEAKER_00]: or lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a river basin is the term used to
describe an area that drains into a large
[SPEAKER_00]: river.
[SPEAKER_00]: The watershed is the term used to describe
the area that drains into a smaller river
[SPEAKER_00]: or stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see evidence here of the
Connecticut River and where the river
flows.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a general overview of the
watershed of the Connecticut River,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the river basins would be closer to
that large or main river there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have something called groundwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's groundwater?
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply put, it's water that's below the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water found in cracks and pours in
sand, gravel, and rocks below the earth's
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, below could be just a shallow area
here, or it could be deep below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it takes a lot more time for water to
penetrate and get down into the deeper
[SPEAKER_00]: layers, but all of this is considered
groundwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it takes only a couple days to get
below the surface, years, centuries,
[SPEAKER_00]: or millennia, it is all considered or
falls in the category of groundwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have something called aquifers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a rock layer that stores water and
allows water to flow through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aquifers are kind of like these large,
almost underground lakes that occur,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of them can take a very long
time to recharge for water to get in there
[SPEAKER_00]: if we do pull some out, but they're
typically very large areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have wetlands in the area where water
table is at near or above the land surface
[SPEAKER_00]: long enough during the year to support
adapted plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a wetland is an area here, we see,
where that water table is at near or above
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does contain water for an extended
period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some wetlands can dry up over time,
but some will hold water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key part, they are long enough during
the year to support adapted plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additional hydrosphere vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a tributary, which is a stream
feeding the larger stream of our lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: A tributary is contributing that water,
and they can flood during time in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reservoir is a lake that stores water for
human use, and an artesian well is a well
[SPEAKER_00]: in which water rises because of the
pressure within the aquifer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see an example here of the artesian
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The saturation level is above.
[SPEAKER_00]: We punch a hole here, a lot of pressure,
kind of the water flowing down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get this kind of free flow and
this natural flow of water through an
[SPEAKER_00]: artesian well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third, we have the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're looking at this biosphere
in general, looking at the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the air blanketing Earth's solid and
liquid surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take a breath in, the amount of air
around us here is mostly composed of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most abundant gas in the Earth's
atmosphere, making up about 70% of the air
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're breathing here on Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxygen is the second most abundant,
making up 21%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And living organisms are used as food
sources, and oxygen is utilized by
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms that digest other organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxygen is released in the atmosphere,
by plants, as a photosynthesize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth's atmosphere has a unique
composition of gases when compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: other plants within the solar system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue light is scattered more than
other wavelengths by gases in the
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere, and that is in part what gives
the blue color to the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind that there is carbon
dioxide, there is neon, there's helium,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's hydrogen, but we could see these
percentages down here are a lot smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen by far, looking up here,
is by far the vast majority at 78%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then comes oxygen, a little argon,
and we see this kind of thin sliver here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon dioxide is the vast majority of
this small portion at .0407%, or 400 parts
[SPEAKER_00]: per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the others are much smaller,
but they do exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: This composition of the atmospheric,
looking specifically at carbon dioxide,
[SPEAKER_00]: makes up approximately .03% of the Earth's
atmospheric gases, and it changes a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit depending where you are, and it's also
sadly changing over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon dioxide concentrations in the
atmosphere are regulated by the removal of
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by
plants, as they fix the carbon from carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide into carbohydrates, and exchanges
of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: and the oceans.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also chemical reactions that occur
between the atmosphere and limestone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of seeing that concentration of
carbon dioxide increase very dramatically
[SPEAKER_00]: over recent years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that atmosphere, we have water,
which is the atmosphere's various
[SPEAKER_00]: considerably, and also contains the
hydraulic cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cycle is the evaporation and
condensation that results almost daily
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see kind of that water cycle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having evaporation of water,
that condensing of water, that
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation, and that kind of water
cycle repeating there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the atmosphere of atmospheric pressure,
and this is the pressure that the
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere exists on Earth, and it
decreases with time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's increasing latitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see a bottle up at a very high
mountain peak, when we start walking down
[SPEAKER_00]: that mountain, and we're probably driving,
basically driving down that mountain,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see it getting crushed here,
because this volume of air contains less
[SPEAKER_00]: particles than it does at sea level.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greater the altitude, the same volume
contains fewer molecules of gases that
[SPEAKER_00]: make up the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that the density of air
decreases as you increase in altitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're at the very top of a very,
very tall mountain, there'll be less dense
[SPEAKER_00]: air than if you're at sea level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Atmospheric pressure versus altitude,
as we can see here, the atmospheric
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure, see more density down here at
the very bottom than at the top of a
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a mountain very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver, for example, will be mile high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 5,280 feet above sea level,
but there's mountains much, much higher
[SPEAKER_00]: than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fourth component of the biosphere is
the geosphere, and this features Earth's
[SPEAKER_00]: surface, kinds of rocks, sea floor,
and everything below the Earth's surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made up of rocks, and rocks are made
up of minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: These minerals are building blocks for the
rocks, and elements are the ultimate
[SPEAKER_00]: building blocks for those minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that example here, forms of carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have amorphous carbon, which is kind of
this blackish kind of substance here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have graphite, which is carbon
organized into sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have diamonds, which is carbon
organized into a very particular structure
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The geosphere is made up of rocks and
minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just eight elements that count for about
98% of the Earth's mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elements composed of the Earth's crust,
as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxygen, silicon, kind of by weight,
a very large percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also aluminum, iron, calcium,
sodium, potassium, magnesium, and a host
[SPEAKER_00]: of others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the formation of the geosphere,
these are the formation of elements by the
[SPEAKER_00]: collision of the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's released as heat, and it's changed
from kinetic energy to heat energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more gravitational attraction towards
planet Earth's center.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also can lead to radioactive decay,
and we see that here, the formation of our
[SPEAKER_00]: geosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's caused by the collision with the
sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very, very large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind this is not exactly the scale
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, we have the layers of the Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that inner core, which is actually
a solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's surrounded by the outer core,
which is liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the mantle here, ultimately
leading to the very edges here,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we have the Earth's crust here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, that is the area that life as
we know it exists in the building there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inner part of the Earth is extremely
hot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's inner core here being a solid,
the outer core being that liquid component
[SPEAKER_00]: of basically melted iron.
