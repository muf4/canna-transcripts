[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a very brief overview
of the functions of the circulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why this image is pictured here
is you may want to think about some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: functions that the circulatory system does
as kind of like what a city may require.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with transportation, that's
probably the most obvious one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The circulatory system is responsible for
transporting oxygen to cells for the
[SPEAKER_00]: process of respiration and also taking
away carbon dioxide from those same cells
[SPEAKER_00]: and bring it to either the gills or the
lungs so it can be eliminated or have some
[SPEAKER_00]: way leave the body system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the circulatory system needs to
absorb products from digestion and bring
[SPEAKER_00]: them to cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing, as it's bringing
nutrients to the cells, it also needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a way to take the waste products away
from the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could also be excessive water.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the human body, this should be brought
to the kidneys and excreted in the urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two other main functions are regulation,
where the circulatory system is taking
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones and transporting them from its
part of the endocrine system to distant
[SPEAKER_00]: organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also helps maintain homeostasis in the
body by way of keeping a constant
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blood clotting protects against blood
loss, and that's an important function,
[SPEAKER_00]: along with carrying white blood cells
around the body so that there can be
[SPEAKER_00]: immunity provided against disease-causing
agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, as promised, this is a very
brief overview of the three main
[SPEAKER_00]: categories of functions of the body's
circulatory system.
