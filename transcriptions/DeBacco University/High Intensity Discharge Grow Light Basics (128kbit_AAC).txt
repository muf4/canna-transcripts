[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're going to look at the
high-intensity discharge grow light
[SPEAKER_00]: basics, typically abbreviated HID lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just the basics here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the cannabis plant here under
a high-intensity light, probably a
[SPEAKER_00]: high-pressure sodium looking at just kind
of a yellow tint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So high-intensity discharge lights are HID
lights, the basic types.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are used to try and replicate the
natural sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different subcategories such
as mercury vapor, HG stands for mercury
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor, metal halide, high-pressure sodium,
and conversion bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two most common you'll find are metal
halide, which will tend to have a more of
[SPEAKER_00]: a whiter look to the light spectrum,
and HPS or high-pressure sodium,
[SPEAKER_00]: which have more of that yellow appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: These HID lights and the suggested
coverage area, depending on the wattage of
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb you're using, will depend on not only
the coverage area, but how far away from
[SPEAKER_00]: the foliage it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 400 watt covers a three by three area
and should be kept about one to two feet
[SPEAKER_00]: above the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: 600 watt covers a four by four area
effectively and should be about a foot and
[SPEAKER_00]: a half to two feet away from the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: A thousand watt covers a five by five area
and should be kept about two feet away
[SPEAKER_00]: from the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, manufacturers will often state
greater areas than what's quoted above,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is assuming dense plants for
maximum yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can a thousand watt do a six by six?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably, but not really effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: It covers a five by five area very
effectively, and that's what I recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: High-intensity discharge lights,
the popular wattage, are four,
[SPEAKER_00]: six, and a thousand watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: A thousand watts pretty much the standard,
which allows for the greatest coverage
[SPEAKER_00]: areas we just saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a bunch of lights here,
all thousand watt, double-ended Gavita
[SPEAKER_00]: Pros for this particular grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they produce light by pressing
electricity through a vaporized gas in a
[SPEAKER_00]: sealed tube under high pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mix of substances in the vapor allow
for different spectrums to be produced,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there are a few light bulb
manufacturers, but odds are you pay for
[SPEAKER_00]: what you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So higher price bulbs will actually
produce a better spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd say it's important not only to go
for the cheapest light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to look for when that's
going to produce the greatest spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: because that can have a large impact on
your total end yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you
soon.
