[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The AI is, it is people training those
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then everyone could have the power of
those expert opinions via computer vision
[SPEAKER_00]: without a person actually looking
personally at their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them would be a pH, either increase
or decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: You typically don't need both.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find you want to correct one
direction only.
[SPEAKER_00]: I built six scales which are all Wi-Fi
enabled or part of the system and every
[SPEAKER_00]: minute they report their weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really shouldn't actually have a
clogging issue if you always have a
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-filter by the way for your pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Automation is there to help you,
to enable you and to do a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you don't want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris aka Mr. Grow It and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode number 37.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode I interviewed Simon,
the creator of the plant studio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of you like to automate your garden
in some way, whether that be through auto
[SPEAKER_01]: watering, environmental controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many different things you can
do to automate your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, we talk about the future
of gardening, complete automation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simon has developed a way to just about
completely automate your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you, the gardener, could be hands off
most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast through Patreon.

[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I am joined with Simon.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the creator of The Plant Studio.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: My voice is still a bit raspy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, Simon will be doing most of the
talking in this episode, so you won't have
[SPEAKER_01]: to deal with my raspiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm excited for this one today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be talking about the future
of gardening, so complete automation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've done quite a bit of work with an
automated system box, whatever you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: call it, an indoor grow setup called The
Plant Studio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too far ahead, we're going
to be talking all about that today and
[SPEAKER_01]: just automation in general that can be
applied to home grow in particular,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get into the details on all of
that, though, can you tell us a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: about yourself and how you got into this
space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Simon Romanski.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm originally from England.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where my accent comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing for a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I got into growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a technical person, so I think I got
into growing when I was in Disneyland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Epcot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a ride called The Living Land,
which is a ride that goes through a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember looking at all these different
methods of growing and it just looked very
[SPEAKER_00]: technical and I was blown away by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, I remember the aeroponics
section.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had these plants on this track that
would revolve around and they would be
[SPEAKER_00]: suspended.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just holding the plants and the
roots are just dangling in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they would take them through this
little chamber where they would get their
[SPEAKER_00]: mist, their water and nutrients basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just was blown away the fact that plants
could even be grown that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's always been the technical,
the interesting, different side of growing
[SPEAKER_00]: that I found interesting and really what
got me started at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think a little differently after
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not all about the hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely a fan of lots of other
living soils and things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's basically where I really think
I got my start from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know before we started recording,
you talked about how you went to school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it mechanical engineering or software
engineering or can you talk to us about
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I went for information management and
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Syracuse and it's a cross
between computer science and management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say I don't consider myself a
programmer but more of a developer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like making solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't write the drivers for stuff and
all the super technical stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are so many tools and frameworks
and APIs and things out there that I love
[SPEAKER_00]: putting stuff together in order to solve
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I went to school for and it's
been a fit for me ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talk about what you just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of relates to what I used to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to work for amazon.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked in the fulfillment center for
eight years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually in their support side of
things too, working with worldwide
[SPEAKER_01]: operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that they do in their
fulfillment centers, and I'm sure there's
[SPEAKER_01]: some people watching this that have worked
at Amazon or work at Amazon right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they pound in your head the process
improvement side of things like
[SPEAKER_01]: streamlining.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mindset has always been how do we make
things more efficient?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we automate things to reduce the
amount of labor hours that are put towards
[SPEAKER_01]: a process?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was actually my first job was working
in fulfillment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked at a fulfillment center and I
liked the order and inventory management
[SPEAKER_00]: and the backend seeing the packages and
the orders and inventory came in and
[SPEAKER_00]: basically what I did for those companies,
I kind of webified them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was dating myself a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a while ago where people were still
like the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people didn't even have dedicated
internet access, continuous internet
[SPEAKER_00]: access.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically wrote some web tools and web
application to allow clients to look and
[SPEAKER_00]: check on inventory and orders themselves
without having to call the customer
[SPEAKER_00]: service rep because when I started,
all these calls were coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, well, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you calling?
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to just look that up
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of where I began was really
fulfillment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I just like the solution providing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like going back in the warehouse because
I worked in the front office and seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: were those pack slips or did it make sense
for the pick pack ship part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fulfillment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's similar also with the fulfillment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely some similarities there and
then you took those skills and now you've
[SPEAKER_01]: applied them to a horticulture,
which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give us a high level overview of
the plant studio that you've created?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cultivation machine and it's
basically there to control everything
[SPEAKER_00]: above the ground and below the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really ground pots or chambers or
whatever your grow method is, but
[SPEAKER_00]: basically root zone and environment above.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole point of it was really to
automate as much of the time consuming
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff as possible because when it comes to
watering, I would forget or if I'm away or
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're doing hydroponics and you're
wanting to monitor the pH or water levels
[SPEAKER_00]: and temperatures and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically I did it so that I didn't
have to spend as much time doing the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that I didn't enjoy doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't mind the plant manipulation
stuff, but I don't like the stuff where
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to constantly stay on top of it
or having to go and manually change things
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room environmentally because the
temperature is too high or the humidity is
[SPEAKER_00]: off or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was basically my, I always say I'm
inherently lazy, but I'll also go way out
[SPEAKER_00]: of my way to try and automate and to
simplify it for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually on your website, I'll mention
it right now so people can check it out if
[SPEAKER_01]: they want to and kind of get a visual of
what we're about to dive deeper into.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's www.plantstud.io.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's plant studio, but you don't even need
the W's.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's plantstud.io.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it couldn't get the dot com,
but you know, I kind of like the dot IO
[SPEAKER_00]: makes sense in a way because it is all
about, you know, input and output.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's plant studio with the dot before
the IO.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are interested in that,
I'll have the link in the description
[SPEAKER_01]: section below on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can easily access that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a great video right on the
homepage, which talks about just a ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: things within a very short period of time
about all this automation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's dive deeper into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with the grow area.
[SPEAKER_01]: What size grow space is it, you know,
and what is the plant studio made out of?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the grow area is, it's a five by nine
and it has, so basically a two light setup
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's eight feet tall because height
always becomes a big issue when growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, especially indoors,
are limited by the height.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty fortunate to be able to have,
you know, pretty high ceilings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The overall dimensions inside the grow
machine is five by 12, but the extra three
[SPEAKER_00]: feet of space is there to accommodate,
you know, the air conditioning,
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier, fans, and basically the
equipment that helps manage the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and gives me some space to
actually, you know, to get inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: To tend to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the machine itself is, the box itself
is made by, from insulated panels that I
[SPEAKER_00]: came up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically wood that is sandwiches,
some high density insulated foam,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then these panels slot together to
make, you know, to make a well insulated
[SPEAKER_00]: and sealed box.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, you know, it's not your typical
stick construction like frame where people
[SPEAKER_00]: frame it and then put it up and then
insulate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are like panels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a sealed environment,
just to confirm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sealed environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have an intake vent,
an exhaust fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's just kind of recirculating
within that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually, I learned this the hard way
because my initial grow was, I didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: any, I wasn't considering any kind of air
circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's how clueless I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came back and I was growing tomatoes in
the early days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I basically came back and it was just
a horrible stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't know, I thought something was
rotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically I realized that when you
basically drown or just deprive the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, not drown actually, it's like just
remove all the CO2 from the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like we wouldn't like, you know,
getting rid of our oxygen and they just
[SPEAKER_00]: make an crazy smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I smell and I realized,
I go, oh, I need to change the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I realized I had two different
choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can either, and that's a lot of
the choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, do you circulate?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, do you, do you have a sealed room
or do you circulate and bring in the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the end, I just decided that a
sealed room is just much easier to control
[SPEAKER_00]: and to maintain because I'm not pulling
any, I'm not dependent on an outside
[SPEAKER_00]: environment that I'm then pulling into
that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it might make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cooler outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can bring the air in and it could cool
it down and it's humidity builds up
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you go, well, we've got to
pump the air out and get rid of that extra
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then again, you're dependent on that
outside environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the trade off though is then if you're
dealing with temperatures, typically
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to be dealing with cooling
because the lights put off heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's insulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you have to cool the heat of the
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to cool that excess heat that
comes off the dehumidifier because it does
[SPEAKER_00]: still put out heat despite the fact that
it's got the cooling side, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it overall generates more than it removes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the benefit was also
controlling the environment, not pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: any pests or any pathogens potentially in
the down, the tricky part is making sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can size the equipment so that it
is able to deal with, say, late stages of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth where your plants are big and
they're putting off a lot of, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiring a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of humidity and the lights
are full bright, cranked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that was a little tricky,
but I would say that my one tip as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: people being able to size correctly,
you take the wattage of all the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have in that box and then
multiply that by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then whatever number you get from that
is basically how many BTUs you would need
[SPEAKER_00]: to remove that you would get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, about 3,000, my machine running
at full capacity with both lights on with
[SPEAKER_00]: the air conditioners and the air
conditioning and the dehumidification
[SPEAKER_00]: running and when I'm running the large
dehumidifier, there's about 3,000 watts
[SPEAKER_00]: max that that runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 3,000 times four, 12,000, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 12,000 is considered one ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a one ton mini split and it's
actually more than capable of cooling
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, with your watts,
that is for also heat watts, like light.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that is going into your photons
and it's not coming off directly as heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to more oversize.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to go too big, but you
definitely have to make sure that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: keep up with the heat and the humidity in
the, you know, sealed room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to reiterate, you said two lights
that you're running, LEDs, and according
[SPEAKER_01]: to your website, they come in at 2.3 micro
moles per joule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got some good efficiency there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people are going to be asking this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us what diodes and driver
you're using for those lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I don't know that I've had
these for a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the Fluence, um, Spyder,
the Spyder X plus, and, uh, they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually even make these bars anymore,
which is almost unfortunate because I,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely a big fan of the bar style
light fixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because I believe it's most closely
represents the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to like, uh,
penetration of the light for your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've got my whole ceiling,
basically there's like 16 bars that go
[SPEAKER_00]: from the back to the, you know,
all the way across the grow area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sun is basically like a giant beam
coming down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as much as it is a spotlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a point as far as we're concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: The photons are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they, they, they're not coming from a
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it doesn't, it's, it makes a lot more
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, the other thing I liked with the
LEDs, um, is that you can get them a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: closer to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I, depending on what style of LEDs
that you use, it will vary how much,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many, how much your photons drop off
based on the distance because the fluence
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have the lenses on these,
the diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I find that the drop off in your PT,
um, PPFD is really, um, it's the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the photon rate drops off a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just, for every foot you,
you bring it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I do play around with
dimming the lights, but then also being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to bring the lights down closer to
the canopy using electrical, less
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity, generating less heat,
less air conditioning to require to cool
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but again, towards the end,
those lights that just, just cranked up
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, the plants, they, they don't
care.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they want as much as you can give
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple more things about the actual
equipment and setup before we dive into
[SPEAKER_01]: the actual platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the sealed environment,
generally speaking, I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people know this is you got to run CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe you're running CO2 tanks inside
the studio.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably have a, most have a
humidifier, dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about the equipment and
then also air circulation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about how all of that
is kind of set up within the space and how
[SPEAKER_01]: the air circulation is achieved in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, uh, the, the CO2 side of things,
I have two tanks, uh, that sit outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, uh, piped in and.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CO2, which naturally drops,
uh, there's, uh, two tubes above the fan,
[SPEAKER_00]: which sits at one end of the, which is the
machine side of the, the system side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the studio that blows the CO2 and
circulates it around as it's needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a sensor that can be raised and
lowered, um, manually from the machine
[SPEAKER_00]: side, um, that I keep at basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canopy level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that CO2 sensor is basically,
I'm, I, I do run elevated CO2 levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, which is a big benefit of having a
sealed room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing is that, um,
because the room is so well sealed that
[SPEAKER_00]: for an entire grow, I won't use maybe 10
pounds of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I think a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Struggle with tanks saying, well,
you know, I'm burning through tanks all
[SPEAKER_00]: the, all the time, but when the room is
really well sealed, um, it's, it's very,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a minimal overhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I did have one at one situation where
my tank did run out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, what I ended up doing was,
you know, I have a secondary tank when it
[SPEAKER_00]: detects that one tank is, is, you know,
when, when, when the tank is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the system sees that the CO2 levels on
rising.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will then assume that that tank is
empty and then flip over to the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the secondary tank, because again,
you know, what happens if the CO2 runs out
[SPEAKER_00]: and you don't want to just change out your
CO2 before it totally depletes just,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, just in case, because, you know,
you've got extra CO2 in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might as well use it until it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have the redundancy on the,
on the CO2 and the.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air circulation currently I have a fan
that, um, the, an oscillating fan and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a small room and it does really well at
keeping pretty good airflow in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a carbon filter and it is
they, it pulls the air from lower down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and basically goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 10 inch pipe and then shoots that
air over the, over the plants also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of constantly stirring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even with those two systems,
I find that I think I could improve on air
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my now, my next upgrade is I will have,
um, two tubes going along the sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the floor and along the ceiling,
which are connected for the entire length
[SPEAKER_00]: of the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll be circulating the air from
either from the underneath and pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the cool air from underneath,
bringing it up to the, the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the ceiling and, um, sending out that
way across these long pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just blowing out, it goes down
the pipe and then comes out all the holes
[SPEAKER_00]: in the pipe to give more of a,
trying to get more of a laminar flow,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they said with CO2, um,
for the plants to really benefit from it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't need a lot of agitation,
but it just needs constant air movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the stagnant areas within the
canopy that become the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it doesn't always require just big
fans blasting everything, just enough slow
[SPEAKER_00]: movement, um, and, and the plants,
uh, supposedly fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what, that's what I've been
reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always, I do a lot of research and then
I come up with, um, try and come up with a
[SPEAKER_00]: solution to see if that actually helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm still playing with the idea of,
am I going to take the air from the top,
[SPEAKER_00]: bring it down to the floor and let that,
uh, you know, hot air, will that rise?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or would I be better off doing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The other way around, but it's easy enough
to flip the direction of the fan and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be experimenting with both ways and figure
out which, which works best, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's CO2 and air circulation now for
the humidifier and dehumidifier that's
[SPEAKER_01]: controlling your relative humidity and
also the heater and the air conditioner
[SPEAKER_01]: that's controlling the temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are those pieces of equipment inside the
box or is it outside the box?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is inside because everything
except for the CO2 is inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the tanks for the CO2 are external so
that, and that gets pumped in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, um, all the electric work,
um, is I have an actual, a sub panel on
[SPEAKER_00]: the outside and then conduit that,
um, goes into the surface mount boxes,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, for the outlets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even those are sealed, um,
with foam so that no air escapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the dehumidifiers inside that's also
one, currently I'm still using,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, your regular, a regular dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that I, um, when the plants
were smaller, I did better using a smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier, um, so that it wasn't
cycling as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as they get bigger, I switched to
a larger dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if, if when, when you can also,
the great thing with the box, it can also
[SPEAKER_00]: be used for, for the, you know,
post.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post-harvest and, and the drying phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that happens, then I actually
switched to a, um, desiccant based
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier, which is, uh, able to deal
with the cooler temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it doesn't have the volume,
but you can have a much cooler temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: and remove, um, I found it's just a lot
more efficient, um, at, for power usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just works a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm planning on incorporating a larger
built-in ducted dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that, um, again, to, to give more
control, uh, you can get dehumidifiers
[SPEAKER_00]: these days that are wifi based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see if it's getting,
you know, if your humidity is getting too
[SPEAKER_00]: high, you could remotely go in and,
and, and lower that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, again, with the bigger systems
that there's always, um, a control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Panel interface where you can then take
some electronics and I could then take my
[SPEAKER_00]: computers, my, my environment controller
and have those directly control the
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier rather than just having it
constantly on and turning it on and off
[SPEAKER_00]: with turning the outlet on and off,
which can be done, but isn't really an
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal way of, of doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get deeper into the environmental
controller and the studio platform in a
[SPEAKER_01]: minute here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last thing I want to cover is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can this system be used for soil,
cocoa and, or hydroponics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause really the, the environment itself,
which is just your, your air temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, and CO2 levels doesn't really
mind what method that you're using to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, aeroponics was my initial because I
thought, well, it's a great way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots get tons of oxygen this way,
and I don't have to deal with a media,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's one less thing to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had great success using
aeroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's, it is kind of a crazy way of
growing because you, you missed the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: for, for three seconds every three
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And besides that, they're just dangling in
the dark and you know, this is high
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure aeroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not like your typical cloner that
has those little ray red nozzles,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, just spraying constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a highly atomized, um,
mist with, um, special nozzles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's that it's very fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mist, um, the emitters are at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as they, uh, they fire, they would,
they, they, they, they circulate and it
[SPEAKER_00]: really swirls around inside them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays suspended for a while before it
even settles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great way of basically touching
all the different, like all the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the parts of the root and getting great
coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but again, I, my last, my last grow
was in cocoa, which was just a departure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to try something different
because I didn't want these big chambers
[SPEAKER_00]: and plants locked into a chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to have some flexibility of
plants and being able to actually move
[SPEAKER_00]: them around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so I did a cocoa grow and,
um, my, my next grow is actually going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be using a living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got, uh, a whole different,
a whole new system set up that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think is going to be, um,
interesting to see, you know, what,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I can produce using, uh, using that
setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool that you've built in
the flexibility to be able to use the
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of mediums like that,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are certainly different,
uh, in numerous ways and you've
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporated the different ways within the
plant studio platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you talk to us about, uh,
plant studio platform?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the, the platform, this is the
almost the hardest part to understand of
[SPEAKER_00]: the system because it's the, this is where
it's like my, my background as a web
[SPEAKER_00]: developer is, um, it's the computers and
there are basic, there are three computers
[SPEAKER_00]: inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three computers for the grow system.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the computers is controlling the,
um, the lights, the temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: the CO2 humidity managing basically
everything above the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a, when do the lights come on and
off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, you know, what's your nighttime
temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, what CO2 levels, you know,
turning the CO2, uh, making sure the CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't run at nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that, that, that's the environment
controller, the reservoir controller,
[SPEAKER_00]: separate system, totally non-dependent on
the environment controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that it has the, um, uh, manages or
monitors the pH, your EC, uh, temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: the depth, um, sensing all the different,
um, attributes of the, of the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, the way it actually does that is
I have a circulation pump and it pumps
[SPEAKER_00]: through, uh, PVC pipe, and that's where
the sensors are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of putting the sensors actually
in the reservoir itself, it circulates the
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir and senses those variables,
the values, um, as it does so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, the idea was also when I do,
um, dosing, and, and things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: it also serves as a, the circulator is
also a mixing system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it makes it easier to,
if you wanted to switch something out,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and also with the reservoir level
going up and down, how do you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, keeping your sense, making sure
your senses are always in the water is
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, um, the system is able to fill and
drain itself automatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was something that was,
this is one of those ones where I just got
[SPEAKER_00]: tired of trying to, you know, I didn't
want to carry buckets around and empty it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the pain that is hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so the, um, it can drain almost
totally empty the reservoir, but also when
[SPEAKER_00]: it fills it, I can then specify how much I
want to put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually do everything based on
liters instead of gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not because I'm English,
because I did grow up with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, I do think of everything in gallons,
but when it comes to dosing, everything
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to be done in milliliters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sometimes you would get those
tablespoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you guys a tablespoon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a teaspoon?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, you know, but now it's all
milliliters and, you know, a liter is a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand liters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives you a better idea of
proportions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but again, it's been great that when I
go to fill it up, 25 gallons is maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: close to what it was by 80 liters or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just say 80 liters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just puts that water in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I go and dose from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, the dosing side of the
reservoir controller, which again,
[SPEAKER_00]: this, this little computer controls,
I have five pumps and they, you can choose
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever liquid you want to mix in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically you'd have your A and B,
a multi-part nutrient, and then maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: micro, I have a Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then you'd have, one of them would
be a pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, either increase or decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: You typically don't need both.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find that you got to drift in one,
you know, you, you want to correct one
[SPEAKER_00]: direction only.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, one of them is a pH adjuster
and the other are all nutrients or
[SPEAKER_00]: additive, um, based and those inject in
line with that circulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after it goes by your temperature,
your pH and your EC, there is a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you'll see in the video,
it's the, the clear acrylic, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of pipe, the drops going in,
that's dropping into the circulation of
[SPEAKER_00]: the, um, of where the, you know,
where the sensors are basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the, the, um, you know,
the, the reservoir controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, what's nice is the computer part
of it then is like, I can then specify a
[SPEAKER_00]: program and saying, all right,
at this time, empty the reservoir,
[SPEAKER_00]: put this many liters into it, dose this
much into it of A, wait until you see that
[SPEAKER_00]: the PPMs has stabilized so that you know
that it's well mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you see that the,
the, the EC has, uh, stabilized,
[SPEAKER_00]: then go into your next, uh, your B
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once that stabilized,
you could specify time or say,
[SPEAKER_00]: let it see if it's stabilized before doing
the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with the pH, again, you can,
uh, a lot of it is just algorithms,
[SPEAKER_00]: different algorithms for pHing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, but the whole thing is basically
set my reservoir up so that it's ready
[SPEAKER_00]: then to feed the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the reservoir controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally independent of the environment
controller, but then for the human side of
[SPEAKER_00]: things, now that that's the control,
it's like the human interface.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you can manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basic, pretty basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go in and turn the lights on,
turn the lights off, um, with a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and I could turn the fans on
circulation pumps and what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's the, that computer is to
control it, but then also to monitor it
[SPEAKER_00]: because all this information, every single
minute, the system reads every value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in a day I'm getting about 40,000
data points at every minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the EC?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the air temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a CO2 level?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the depth of the reservoir?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what's the, the, uh, air conditioner
or the, the, the watts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I track the power usage of things
like the dehumidifier because that enables
[SPEAKER_00]: me to see if I've sized it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see the, if I see that thing is
peaked and running all the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you're going to need a bigger
dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or it's set up incorrectly where it's
short cycling because, uh, something's
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing on it or it's, it's just not
moving the air properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, the human interface part is again,
it's gathering the data, but also it's
[SPEAKER_00]: what, and again, you can see in the video,
it shows the graphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what I'll put up in my bedroom up on
the TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be, you know, live streaming,
you know, I have his exactly showing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, gauges, what, what my current pH
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it gets too high, it can send off
an alert, but it also changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have everything kind of green when
things start going red.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, also with this human interface
component, um, computer, it allows me to
[SPEAKER_00]: go back at any point in time of the grow
and see exactly at that stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that environment was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives me history for analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every grow, I have all that
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might seem overkill to say,
well, you don't need to do it every
[SPEAKER_00]: minute, but with some of these systems and
these time series databases and things
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have out there, it's,
it's not that much information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a high def 4k video that's
streaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got more bandwidth in probably a
minute than you'd, you'd have in an entire
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, if you can gather that
information, why not have it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's very easy to then go back
and with the, you know, with a mouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just select a certain time span.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows me all the stage,
all the, um, the readings from all the
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors at that point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's just a really useful
thing to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really what people, and I spend
my most time using is the human interface,
[SPEAKER_00]: the other things just do their job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not that I try and, you know,
they, they, they manage the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: You uncovered a lot there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a lot of control with this
plant studio platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, guys check out the video that is
in the link in the description on the,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the website, you'll see exactly what
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: What exactly, what Simon just explained
with the graphs and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now for the reservoir controller,
you said that's controlled on one
[SPEAKER_01]: computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really sounds just so hands off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people are probably
listening to this and their, their ears
[SPEAKER_01]: are really perking up because it
completely automates feeding entirely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can have several different bottles
hooked up to this and it can dose and it
[SPEAKER_01]: can wait for things to be stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it could do the next dose and then
wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, I've never seen this level
of automation before, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly on the home growth side of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there are some commercial
operations that are automated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how automated they are,
but for the most part, the fact that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can actually control the water levels,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your hands off on the water level,
your hands off on dosing nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: your hands off on pH, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're even hands off when it
comes to your environment completely,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you have an environmental
controller.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to ask you where the probes
are located within the space, but you
[SPEAKER_01]: have, you have basically controller probes
that hook up to the environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: controller.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to automatically turn on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And off your humidifier, dehumidifier,
air conditioner, heater in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: control those, those measurements,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is the, the probes located for like
CO2 and temp?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the one that is hanging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have conduit that goes from the
environment controller, which is it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: to the left of the wall mounted mini
split.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it basically goes along the ceiling
right into the middle of the grow area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I basically, that's not automated
the raising and lowering of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that sensor, but that sensor is the
temperature, humidity, and CO2 sensor on,
[SPEAKER_00]: on, on a wire basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is hardwired to the environment
controller itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one other piece, which I don't,
I think you might have briefly covered it
[SPEAKER_01]: is it's shown in the video is it
automatically is calculating your energy
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption and putting a dollar sign to
it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's telling you literally it's having
a water, how much water you're using,
[SPEAKER_01]: putting a dollar amount to it,
how much you're spending for water,
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, dollar amount, electricity
consumption, dollar amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're getting down to that granular
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will vary based obviously on where
you live in, in the new England water here
[SPEAKER_00]: is, is pretty cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: California, I know that's, that's a
different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, the electricity is the,
the biggest resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do try, I track the, the electric,
the CO2 usage, the water and the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, because you know, how many
milliliters you put in of each nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a database saying,
this is the nutrient I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent this much for the nutrient and it
has this many milliliters in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know on a per milliliter,
how much does that nutrient cost on a per
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliter basis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I feed it, I know how much that,
that feeding even cost, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: my electric, my electric cost when it is
really cranking for me here is about $5 a
[SPEAKER_00]: day is my, is my cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by having a sealed room, the AC and
the dehumidifier are kind of close to half
[SPEAKER_00]: the other half of the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the price that you pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been thinking about, you know,
ways of, you know, using the winter,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cold outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I use that as a means of dehumidifying
or cooling without directly bringing that
[SPEAKER_00]: air in using some kind of a chiller system
and, and making it more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, for simplicity sake, having
everything in the room just is definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: the way to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a sealed room, I think is a good way
of starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could always go to air exchange if,
if it makes sense, if the environment is
[SPEAKER_00]: conducive to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I'm about knowing that it's
totally controlled and not being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: have an excuse and saying, well,
that was a hot day and all the humidity is
[SPEAKER_00]: being killing me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I, you know, this, this box could
be run in any environment as long as the
[SPEAKER_00]: ambient environment where the reservoir is
obviously doesn't get below freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I can, I have a heater,
I have a chiller for the reservoir,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is outside of the, the studio box
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, that, that's something that,
again, I'm constantly trying to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: the efficiency of the resources used for
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's why I'm also excited
to try out the soil, doing a soil grow
[SPEAKER_00]: next, because, you know, my, my last grow,
I decided to put each plant on a scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the scale- So I was going to ask you
about next, as if you could talk about the
[SPEAKER_01]: scale side of things, because that's
pretty mind blowing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and, and that, that's even changed
from, from that grow until now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, the, the idea was how do I,
you know, went to water plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people would say, well,
you, you pick them up and you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a sense of how, you know,
the weight and gives you a better sense
[SPEAKER_00]: than just trying to stick your finger in
the top and feeling how dry the soil is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I built six scales, which are all
wifi enabled or part of the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every minute they report their weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I fertigate, I was using these
covers that have two misters in them and
[SPEAKER_00]: it would water all the plants at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked great in the beginning,
but, and the nice thing is I could see
[SPEAKER_00]: also by doing that, that all the plants
were actually getting water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one of them were to clog, I've never
had a clogging issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really shouldn't actually have a
clogging issue if you always have a
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-filter by the way, for your pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd always recommend you have to put a
pre-filter on the pump that really almost
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigates clogging issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all the plants I could see would be
getting a liter, a few, a couple liters
[SPEAKER_00]: when that, when they were smaller and it
was very accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all got the same amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, their weight would all increase,
but then as one plant would overtake and
[SPEAKER_00]: have different water requirements of the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm like, well, I don't want to give
them all the same amount of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: One needs more than the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd end up taking some of the misters
and I'd say, Hey, give it to this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he gets extra and he gets one less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there was two misters per plant,
but now you're going away from the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: automation thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my latest setup that I actually haven't
run yet is a manifold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like an irrigation manifold,
but, but it's also why it's controlled by
[SPEAKER_00]: the reservoir controller that can say send
water only to this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I can water each individual plant
separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that's going to allow for is,
you know, you can try different
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could let some plants, if they're all
clones, then that would be almost ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you could really then understand
different watering patterns and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: affect those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to do a deep watering less
frequently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Small watering more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other part is that also,
because it ties into the reservoir,
[SPEAKER_00]: I could then potentially mix in the
reservoir, a different mix potentially for
[SPEAKER_00]: each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could put in, and I'm actually going
to have to downsize the reservoir a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit if I'm doing on an individual plant
basis, but by with a smaller reservoir,
[SPEAKER_00]: I could then mix up some new nutrients,
send it to plan a, and then I can flush
[SPEAKER_00]: that out or, you know, empty, empty,
you know, give it all everything that's in
[SPEAKER_00]: the reservoir, empty it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the next plan, give it a
different nutrient and it may be a
[SPEAKER_00]: different quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you could then set up different
tests, experiments for all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that to me is a great way of doing
your phenotype hunting because you
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously, you know, you start with your
genetics, but different nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: what works for some might not work for
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this way, I think it's a good way of
automating, staying consistent,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think a lot of people,
when you're growing, they go, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to mix up a different batch
for each different plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's automated, it doesn't then let
the machine do the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't, you just sit and watch and get
an idea of, you know, what effect that
[SPEAKER_00]: has.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's still coming down to the person to
look at the plants, to see if it's a happy
[SPEAKER_00]: plant or not, and to see what kind of
results you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that to me, as far as the gardening,
that seems like that's the enjoyable part
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last piece I wanted to have you
talk about, which is really fascinating,
[SPEAKER_01]: is the imaging computer you have that
inspects the plant health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's actually a separate computer
It's a really small computer that I had
[SPEAKER_00]: hooked up to an old SLR that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they just, you want a good
camera with a good lens that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: take much better pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's set up so that every 10
minutes of the plant's life, they have
[SPEAKER_00]: their picture taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is that it only takes their
picture, but it also stores it on that
monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monitoring computer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at any point in time, not only could I
go back and say, what was I feeding or
[SPEAKER_00]: what was the EC and pH, but you can also
see how the plants looked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing that I actually found that,
I mean, originally I did it because I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought it was just kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, everyone likes a time lapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've seen the amazing
fungi show on Netflix and all those time
[SPEAKER_00]: lapses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just mesmerizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cool thing is I think when you
feed your plants, you can't see how
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing at that point, how they're
responding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you put it in a time lapse and you
get to look at them over that,
[SPEAKER_00]: even over one day, you know, you've got
your six pictures an hour in a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get to see, did they seem to respond
well or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people seem to have a good sense
of a happy or a non-happy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And definitely seeing the growth,
you can watch it within one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty easy to see growth just to
even at a 10 minute interval pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's partly for, I thought it
was cool, but I found it really useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I am able to run a script and at
the end of the day, it can, it can just
[SPEAKER_00]: generate that day's time lapse,
or I could say give me over the last three
[SPEAKER_00]: days or from the beginning of the grow
until now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I watch time lapses all the time just
to get a feel for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, just cause it's kind of
cool to watch also, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that is really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do as many time lapses as I
should.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people like to see the time
lapses in videos and I don't do many of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only done a handful of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a lot of content creators
that do a lot of time lapses, but that's
[SPEAKER_01]: really cool that you're able to add that
into your automated system and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, for plant health purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see how well your plant is
doing as far as the health of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the other part I should have
mentioned is it's also a great way of,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, if you have a high enough res
picture, being able to take something and
[SPEAKER_00]: then maybe identifying plant issues that
you're having, deficiencies, overwatering,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it underwatering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like sometimes you can look at a plant and
you get a sense of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's also something I continue to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to get it so that I can get in
closer on the individual leaves so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can start to identify what might be
going on with the plant itself from a
[SPEAKER_00]: health standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the other aspect that I think is
useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, I'd love to tie it into some kind
of a computer vision where the system can
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of look and go, oh, that looks like
you've got a calcium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks like that's, you know,
it's been overwatered or underwatered or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever the problem may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I know some people might say,
well, you know, that's going to take an
[SPEAKER_00]: expert, a person in order to be able to
identify that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people have to realize, too,
that with the computer vision,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of that stuff and the AI is it is
people training those systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really is a person takes pictures
and they say, this is this problem and
[SPEAKER_00]: this looks like that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after you've given the machine enough
of those, it gets better identifying
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then everyone doesn't have to be an
expert on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have experts who have identified
these issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that gets then everyone could
have the power of those expert opinions
[SPEAKER_00]: via computer vision without a person
actually looking personally at their
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do think that the AI and the machine
learning stuff is a fascinating and
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely a would definitely be seeing a
lot more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's already been done quite a bit
also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when will this plant studio be
available?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how much does something like this
cost?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not currently available,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that it's difficult
because it requires it's a large box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a large machine, but it also requires
an electrician to bring in, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a circuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a 30 amp 240 volt circuit going to
a subpanel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm not an electrician,
so I have to have an electrician hook that
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have the mini split, depending on
the distance that you're running it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might have to have someone come in who
has access who can charge it with the
[SPEAKER_00]: required refrigerant to get that going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like putting an addition
on a house or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need like these subs who can all do
their part, you know, to get everything
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not to say I wouldn't like to get to
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is also why I've made a lot of
the like the reservoir controller itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made I didn't want to cut out with wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually got a CNC machine,
learned to use a CNC machine, designed it,
[SPEAKER_00]: had the CNC cut all the parts out and then
put it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a perfect fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it works well for replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never replicated it again using that
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've still because I I've been getting
into the details of the software and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, and it it'd be pretty
expensive because a lot of the components
[SPEAKER_00]: that I use are really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing you have to keep in mind is
you need good sensors to get good data.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your pH sensor is not accurate,
it's garbage in, garbage out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need good quality information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want the efficiency of the air
conditioning, you need something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be have a high sear rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll cost you less to run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do with less expensive units and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know it's not exactly answering your
question, but it is something that I do
[SPEAKER_00]: think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, I am definitely,
definitely working on it for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it was just individual components,
you know, whether it be the controllers or
[SPEAKER_01]: even like the software.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure people would love.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure people are listening to this
salivating how the software is and how,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, automated it can be,
you know, just if it was a plug and play
[SPEAKER_01]: version where you could attach your own
equipment that you have in your growth
[SPEAKER_01]: space to the software.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be extremely
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hope to see something like that in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wrapping things up, how can listeners
find you and what do you have upcoming in
[SPEAKER_01]: the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: My email, my easiest way is to email me is
my email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simon at romanski.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Simon at romanski.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant Studio, plantstud.io is my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm planning on doing, I want to do
more social media and interact more with
[SPEAKER_00]: people like minded people out there,
or even people who could compliment what I
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't consider myself to have a green
thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am able to automate and I've learned a
lot from YouTube and listening to shows
[SPEAKER_00]: like yours as far as the more the
cultivation side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, you know, my angle and my what I
bring really is the systems and the
[SPEAKER_00]: automation to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm basically just I also
want to help people understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: automation, it seems complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people go, well, it's also prone
to error.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that doesn't work, then then it's
going to, you know, then then what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen to my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think most people will find that it
is there to help you to enable you and to
[SPEAKER_00]: do a lot of the things that you don't want
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'd say don't carry a bucket of
water from one to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even something as simple like using
something like some of these diaphragm
[SPEAKER_00]: pumps you can get for 50 bucks that has a
built in pressure switch so you can stick
[SPEAKER_00]: a hose in a bucket and it self primes,
it pumps the water and sends it to where
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't don't make it hard on yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use some of the stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make you enjoy it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start at least monitor and get get
an inexpensive camera to look at your your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could even pan over to a
temperature and humidity sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a standalone load sitting
there and now you can remotely see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get these cameras for like 35
bucks that can pan and tilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want you to get the subscription for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're just doing a live view to
check on your plants and see what the
[SPEAKER_00]: current environment is, why not do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very inexpensive way of being able
to kind of have some remote access to your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and to give you some hopefully
comfort that everything's going well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that that would be my
advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: For people and again, people feel free.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of this is interesting and would
like to reach out to me, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: please do so.

what type of automation do you have in
[SPEAKER_01]: your garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us know down in the comments section
below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lastly, if you are tuning in on Apple
podcasts, please leave a rating and
[SPEAKER_01]: review.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are coming up to I believe 200 ratings
and reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: So almost there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Need your help to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you to everyone who has left a
rating and review so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simon, thank you so much for coming on to
the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been an eye opener and a sense to
know that there is this automation being
[SPEAKER_01]: worked on and things will be easier for
people in the garden, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm excited for the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you having me on to
talk about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy the rest of your day.
See you next time.
