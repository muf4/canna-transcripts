[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a diverse and healthy roots on
ecology is like one of the non-essential
[SPEAKER_01]: elements of a growing that is probably one
of the most essential things that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the environmental factories,
your soil moisture content, and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: the temperature of the room have a huge
role to play in the nutrient uptake and
[SPEAKER_01]: transpiration ability of your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know your mineral nutrition,
your nitrates, your phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_01]: your potassium, that is the same molecule
regardless of bottle, salt, brand,
[SPEAKER_01]: country of origin, all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are constantly evolving as
we're growing them, you know, because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not growing out in the wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: So their needs are going to evolve as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a that's why I think things like
leaf tissue testing, leachate testing are
[SPEAKER_01]: so important to really know what the
plants eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk podcast.

and he does consulting for things such as
[SPEAKER_00]: IPM, plant nutrition, gaining efficiency
and cultivations, and cultivation protocol
[SPEAKER_00]: planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I narrowed down the focus in this episode
to proper nutrition for plants throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: their entire life.

[SPEAKER_00]: And we're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am joined with Mike Chang from
Canit Cribs Consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you, Chris?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you and I have worked on some projects
in the past and I feel like it was just a
[SPEAKER_00]: few months ago where I was like,
come on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to get you on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have so much good knowledge when it
comes to horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a ton of knowledge in plant
nutrition, IPM, gaining efficiencies in
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivations, and cultivation protocol
planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, I figured we'd focus in on plant
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a bunch of good questions lined up
for you and I think this is going to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of value to the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, can you tell us a little bit
about yourself and how you got into
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I started everything after I
got out of the military in 2010 and I
[SPEAKER_01]: started to grow at home in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of a hobbyist, but back then,
it was kind of wild westy and you could
[SPEAKER_01]: sell your buds to co-ops and all that
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, I wanted to kind of get an
education in agriculture and kind of do
[SPEAKER_01]: things a little bit more properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went to the U of A in Arizona and
while I was there, I got a really good
[SPEAKER_01]: internship at an ag company and pivoted
into agriculture for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was working in like field corn,
cotton, a lot of greenhouse stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cucumbers, tomatoes, the agricultural
world in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty, pretty vast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wasn't short on work there,
but I just got the itch to come back and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's when I got with Nate and we started
to just, I started to work for him and we
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of built this consulting side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting into plant nutrition,
there are essential elements for plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and there are non-essential elements for
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about the essential elements
for plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the common knowledge for most essential
nutrients is going to be like your NPK,
[SPEAKER_01]: your nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have your slew of
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The micronutrients, that's what we know as
essential right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like molybdenum, boron,
iron, manganese, you know, the main usual
[SPEAKER_01]: suspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're constantly learning about new
roles that elements play in plants as we
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to study plants, which is kind of
an interesting thing that you asked about
[SPEAKER_01]: non-essential elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can go over the essential
elements first here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like nitrogen, basic building block,
that's going to be for all your amino
[SPEAKER_01]: acids, you know, all of the cell
structures, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's basic building blocks for
tissues and chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your phosphorus is going to be mainly your
energy transport, things like it's moving
[SPEAKER_01]: in ATP, it's helping move metabolites
across membranes, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium is going to be for your enzyme
activation and to move sugars across the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and for osmotic pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those three things are the most used by
the plant in addition to oxygen,
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon and hydrogen, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all the micronutrients play other
roles in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of like vitamins in humans
where we need carbs, fat and protein,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we also need vitamins for all of our
other functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the micronutrients like calcium,
sulfur, magnesium, those all fill that
[SPEAKER_01]: role.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the micronutrients and the
macronutrients would be considered your
[SPEAKER_01]: essential elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can go into any one of those in
more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the non-essential elements
for plants, like one that comes to mind
[SPEAKER_00]: right away is silica, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Although silica is essential in some
plants, but not in the medicinal plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that we all know and love, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the research is still out because
what a lot of the current research on
[SPEAKER_01]: silica's role in a plant's metabolism now
is finding is that not only is it kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe not part of metabolism and it just
gets deposited onto cell walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why everyone knows that it's
good to have silica in plants so that they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't get overfed on by bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But silica actually plays a pretty
important role in a lot of the metabolic
[SPEAKER_01]: pathways for biotic and abiotic stress in
the plant, whether it's drought or some
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of a pest like a chewing bug or even
like a fungal pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that we're seeing that silica is
involved in those metabolic pathways,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of those metabolic pathways we know
are conserved in other plants and higher
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all it takes at this point is for us to
connect the dots in the research to see
[SPEAKER_01]: how silica actually functions in the
medicinal plants that we're typically
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to cultivate at large scale and
then kind of have hard evidence for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now the kind of common knowledge is
changing where silica is being considered
[SPEAKER_01]: a kind of an essential nutrient as far as
making sure that a cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's field ag or indoor,
ag is maximizing its growing potential and
[SPEAKER_01]: reducing its need for pest control
products by increasing the plant's natural
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance to things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some ways that folks can add in
silica to the garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know like on the organic side of things,
you've got rice hulls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you are growing with synthetic
or mineral based, it usually comes within
[SPEAKER_00]: a bottle, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it's what orthosilicic acid,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, some sort of silicic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are all great sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silicic acids kind of work in the
principle of like direct delivery or kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of as close to direct delivery as
typically was available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other sources like potassium silicates
kind of rely on your root zone's ecology
[SPEAKER_01]: to make that silica available to the plant
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a newer technology out that
certain companies like I think I know
[SPEAKER_01]: Ventana Plant Science is using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a silica nanoparticle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an SNP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been research showing that
silica particles under 20 micrometer or 20
[SPEAKER_01]: microns in size can directly get uptaken
into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's newer ways that we're finding
to deliver silica into plants that are a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more efficient and won't really
mess with mineral nutrition programs like
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium silicates and things like that
would and are kind of I use at a lower
[SPEAKER_01]: rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have to use so much of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my next question is what is like
the application rate for silica?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is one of those gray areas where the
research hasn't fully been elucidated yet
[SPEAKER_01]: for like things like medicinal plants or
even some of our more major crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that it does help.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are certain set PPM guidelines or
set application guidelines for certain
[SPEAKER_01]: products, but those are all based on a
very narrow scope of research right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think as we kind of like study it
more, we'll find out the best way to apply
[SPEAKER_01]: and the best amounts to apply so that
we're not kind of over applying because
[SPEAKER_01]: over applying fertilizers has kind of been
one of the biggest issues right now in
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all about making sure that we're
being as efficient as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other non essential elements are out
there that you would recommend growers
[SPEAKER_00]: consider adding into the garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as far as elements, I can't
really think of like, like I couldn't name
[SPEAKER_01]: like a metal that you should add,
but there's certain aspects of plant
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation that are lost on the purely
mineral side of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can absolutely grow a plant in an
inert environment with the right mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition, but there's certain things like
making sure that your carbon and nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio is correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having added roots on ecology to help
fixate more nitrogen out of the air,
[SPEAKER_01]: help fixate phosphorus that's in the soil
that may have become immobilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think having a diverse and healthy
roots on ecology is like one of the non
[SPEAKER_01]: essential elements of a growing that is
probably one of the most essential things
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the interactions that plants
have with their roots on ecology and just
[SPEAKER_01]: the space around them that kind of helps
them optimize their growth or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The balance of elements within the medium
is certainly important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's often said that medicinal
plants require more nitrogen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation stage and more phosphorus and
potassium in the flower stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that true science or bro science?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only true science yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the bro are right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the times they just haven't been
validated yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main reason why you want to add
more nitrogen really to any growing plant
[SPEAKER_01]: is to increase the growth to have more
basic building materials for those
[SPEAKER_01]: building blocks for those amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and also high nitrogen delivery can
signal things in the plants that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: shift them to produce even more vegetative
growth, more luxurious growth to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: be more hungry for other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which in turn adds to more growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So higher nitrogen in earlier stages is
typically recommended also because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of research out that directly
correlates more plant biomass in the
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetative stage, equating to more
inflorescence or like more cut flower
[SPEAKER_01]: yield towards the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have more biomass in the
beginning, if you can get more vigorous,
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy, fast growth in a shorter amount
of time, usually with higher nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: rates, then that's what you'd opt for so
that in flower you can get the most
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits from that veg time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as far as kind of shifting over
into the phosphorus and potassium side,
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus definitely is required by the
plant in really both stages, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the vegetative or the flowering stage,
because like we talked about, one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: main reasons why the plant needs
phosphorus is for that energy transport
[SPEAKER_01]: and for its metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want the plant to be bottlenecked
by phosphorus during those critical stages
[SPEAKER_01]: in flower where we're pumping secondary
metabolites or we're trying to increase
[SPEAKER_01]: cell density in flowers, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So phosphorus can be very important in
those later stages and you might want to
[SPEAKER_01]: add like a PK boost so you make sure that
phosphorus isn't your bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the jury is a little bit out on
potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a couple of research studies
done on how potassium kind of affects and
[SPEAKER_01]: it seems affects the growth of medicinal
plants or even other cultivars of just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There seems to be a range that like
medicinal plants can tolerate when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to potassium, which is actually a
pretty wide range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there has been research that shows
that it's almost maybe cultivar specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's outliers within research that show
like, you know, we didn't really get any
[SPEAKER_01]: results off of high or low potassium in
this study except for this one strain
[SPEAKER_01]: where, you know, higher potassium gave
bushier growth, larger fan leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're seeing that it's a little bit
cultivar specific when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium, but the phosphorus definitely,
you don't want that to be a bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do want to make sure that you're
applying enough and you do want to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that you are applying enough
phosphorus in the beginning stages where
[SPEAKER_01]: you need those roots and shoots because it
is very important in that new growth as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also important in energy
transport later on down the line where the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is having a lot of secondary
metabolite actions and it needs to move a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of things throughout the plant and it
requires energy to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, phosphorus is definitely
important later on in flower, but you
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely don't want to over apply
something like phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to do things like maybe leaf
tissue testing to make sure that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the right amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're growing hydroponically,
it's a little bit easier to precision feed
[SPEAKER_00]: and get certain ratios of nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium, so on and so forth,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But how about the folks that are growing
with bottles, synthetics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they control that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they ensure that they're not that
the medium is balanced?
[SPEAKER_00]: With the proper elements throughout the
entire plant's life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with keeping your NBK balance,
you really have to kind of defer to the
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturer specs on whatever nutrient
you're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they'll usually break it off
into like a nitrate bottle or like a cow
[SPEAKER_01]: mag bottle, things like that, so that you
can play with those numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wanted to get hard data,
of course, you would do things like leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue testing, which honestly is
available to the home growers nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just mail in your samples,
but if you didn't want to get that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: granular and that focused on it,
what you'd want to do is kind of just look
[SPEAKER_01]: at the numbers on your bottles and then
just do the math on what you're putting
[SPEAKER_01]: down in that gallon or so of water that
you're applying to your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at that point, you can be assured
that you have at least those numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of call that the shotgun approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have at least those set numbers that
you're delivering to the plant so that if
[SPEAKER_01]: the conditions are right enough,
the plant will use those nutrients in that
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big thing is testing your leachate.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the larger plant cultivators out
there will test the water that's leaching
[SPEAKER_01]: out of their substrate so they can
actually know, hey, this is too high in
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus so we can lower our phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we can do this or that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barring that, you really just have to
trust the ratios that the manufacturer's
[SPEAKER_01]: provided.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to make sure you're just
doing good watering and fertigation
[SPEAKER_01]: practices like getting your runoffs,
making sure that you're applying evenly
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout your substrate, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not forget about organic
cultivators, the folks that are adding in
[SPEAKER_00]: organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people might be listening to this and
be like, balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just add it on top and let the plant
uptake as it needs to.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, is the plant in fact uptaking what
it needs, when it needs and leaving behind
[SPEAKER_00]: in the medium what it doesn't need?
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what plants do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with organic production, it's a slow
burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like barbecue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't really know what you're putting
on the plant every day and what's being
[SPEAKER_01]: taken up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're putting on basically as much as you
think you need for a set amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in that time, you're hoping that
your plant doesn't run into a deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time you reapply, you're hoping
that you don't have an accumulation of
[SPEAKER_01]: that particular thing like, say,
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with organic production, you really
have to know your cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these grape producers and tomato
producers that are doing it outdoors and
[SPEAKER_01]: organically, they're doing it with
cultivars that they know exactly how to
[SPEAKER_01]: run and they know exactly what the
nutritional needs are in the different
[SPEAKER_01]: life stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you know your cultivars that well,
then it's fairly easy to plan your
[SPEAKER_01]: applications of organic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, then you kind of, again,
do like a shotgun approach in your media
[SPEAKER_01]: where you add as much as you think you
need that plant's going to need for a set
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you reapply after that time has
expired, ideally doing leaf tissue tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of field agriculture, they live and
breathe off of leaf tissue tests because
[SPEAKER_01]: that allows you to know exactly what you
need to put on and you don't need to over
[SPEAKER_01]: apply, which means you don't need to
overspend on fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to organic production,
you kind of look at it the same way where
[SPEAKER_01]: if you do a leaf tissue test, maybe once
every one or like maybe once or twice
[SPEAKER_01]: every growth cycle and just kind of track
how your nutrients are being used in your
[SPEAKER_01]: media as you amend it during your mix,
then you can know that, oh, I need to add
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit more calcium sulfate or hey,
I need to add a little bit more nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: during this phase because my plants seem
very hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would have to be, it's a very time
intensive process if you don't have leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue testing, because you're just going
off of symptoms in the plant and just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of how you know that plant should grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you, you could speed that up with,
with, with leaf tissue testing and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: really dial in an organic program,
almost as good as a conventional
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture salt program.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned leaf tissue testing,
but you don't mention soil testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a reason why you don't mention
soil testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: So with leaf tissue testing, it's a little
bit more of a consistent picture of what's
[SPEAKER_01]: in the soil because the plant is taking it
up and distributing it as it sees fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: With soil testing, it's, it's tricky,
especially in an organic media that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: amended, because if you take a core sample
and if you do a soil test off of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that may not be indicative of what's in
that entire root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also how you irrigate and what the plants
are sitting in, whether it's a pot or a
[SPEAKER_01]: bed, is a big difference on how it can
affect nutrients, either leaching through
[SPEAKER_01]: and out or being used up by the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically we like to use the liquids
that either go onto and off of a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at that point, you kind of think
of the media as more like a, like a
[SPEAKER_01]: buffer, a sponge that's holding certain
amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the right amendments,
with the right CEC, you'd expect it to
[SPEAKER_01]: hold certain amounts of certain nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you just measure what you're putting
on with what you're putting out,
[SPEAKER_01]: even in an organic setting, you can find,
you're going to have a ratio of uptake,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's actually going into the plant,
what's not coming out in the leachate over
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at that point, you can get a
clearer picture as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flipping back to synthetic nutrients,
I have a viewer question here,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny to me at least, which is if
base nutrients have phosphorus and
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium in them, are PK boosters really
necessary?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I had a couple people actually say
that PK boosters were just snake oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's mineral nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it necessary?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it really depends on your nutrient
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in like, for instance, I would say that
PK boosters for certain cultivars would be
[SPEAKER_01]: necessary, especially if you're running a
very efficient fertigation program,
[SPEAKER_01]: because in an efficient fertigation
program, you're not over applying
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus and potassium, definitely not
phosphorus, at times where the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't need too much phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would want the phosphorus to be
right within the ranges that you would
[SPEAKER_01]: expect to find in healthy leaf tissue
tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, certain cultivars may have a certain
point at which they do have a higher than
[SPEAKER_01]: baseline need for phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in those situations, having a PK boost
that you can do for maybe one to two weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: of that plant's growth cycle, when it
really needs that phosphorus boost would
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like I said, before you don't want
that phosphorus to be a bottleneck in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant's metabolism, especially in those
important stages where there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: secondary metabolisms happening and we're
making all of our nice secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolites that we like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is definitely a need for PK
boosters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, to tell you the truth,
the most common PK booster that I,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we've used in the ag world is just
straight up monopotassium phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's zero 52 34 doesn't get more
PK boosty than that really.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different versions like
dipotassium phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a product from ICL called PEC
acid, which is basically a crystallized
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphoric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's zero 60 20, but there's plenty of
mineral nutrition solutions in the ag
[SPEAKER_01]: industry for PK boosts because that
requirement exists in plants to have
[SPEAKER_01]: certain boosts of certain macronutrients
during growth stages, where you don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to apply those high levels of those like
phosphorus and potassium throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire growth cycle because it's
unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, PK boosters do have a place,
but they have a place in a well-programmed
[SPEAKER_01]: and a well-planned fertigation and
fertilizer protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard from several different people
that a lot of these nutrient companies are
[SPEAKER_00]: putting an excess amount of phosphorus in
there, you know, more phosphorus than the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is going to need for its entire
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing the same thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have there been any companies that have
kind of revised their formula since those
[SPEAKER_00]: findings have come out?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as you look at the mineral salt
programs that are coming onto the market
[SPEAKER_01]: and are being revised on the market,
I like, there's a couple of nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: brands that I've been watching,
you know, for many years and I've slowly
[SPEAKER_01]: seen the numbers of their macros and
micros kind of evolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's definitely where it's
going because a lot of these original salt
[SPEAKER_01]: recipes are based on like tomato formulas
or cucumber formulas or cut flour
[SPEAKER_01]: formulas.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of them were specifically made for,
you know, medicinal plants or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, specialty crops like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once the research is done on what these
specialty crops need, then the
[SPEAKER_01]: formulations of the nutrients will follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really glad you mentioned that
about the feeding chart because I remember
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the day when I first started,
I was using Foxfarm nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at their feeding chart,
you'll see like the recommended PPMs are
[SPEAKER_00]: just out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people don't know this,
but you had just mentioned it is these
[SPEAKER_00]: formulas are created for a wide variety of
plants, not just medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of folks, you know, you often
hear that it's recommended to start with a
[SPEAKER_00]: half dose according to what the feeding
chart says.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's because that nutrient line
is probably formulated for other plants
[SPEAKER_00]: besides medicinal ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you mentioned that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And newer cultivars or older cultivars,
you know, like the plants are constantly
[SPEAKER_01]: evolving as we're growing them,
you know, because they're not growing out
[SPEAKER_01]: in the wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: So their needs are going to evolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's that's why I think things like
leaf tissue testing, leachate testing are
[SPEAKER_01]: so important to really know what the
plants eating, you know, unless you see
[SPEAKER_01]: the plate after they're done eating,
you didn't really know what it liked or
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't like, you know, so that that type
of analytical testing gives us that window
[SPEAKER_01]: into what the plants really need and
allows us to dial it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to flip back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of going back and forth,
back and forth here, but it's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the folks using organic inputs,
what should they know prior to using them?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the biggest things that I would
recommend is know where your source
[SPEAKER_01]: material comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of kind of smaller organic
soil producers or media companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you really want to get companies that
have vetted where they're getting their
[SPEAKER_01]: forest materials from, where they're
getting their peat from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously you want to look to see if
they're certified, if they have army
[SPEAKER_01]: certifications or any other sort of like
governing body certification to show that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barring that, it would really have to be
like knowing the consistency of your
[SPEAKER_01]: product as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Media, like I brought up, is a good
example.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be a media company that makes
fantastic organic media, but if their
[SPEAKER_01]: supplier for forest material drops out,
then the media itself can change and be
[SPEAKER_01]: completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So finding consistencies in that type of
an organic world is very challenging,
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely more challenging than the
mineral world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it's a chemical that has a certain
number of these molecules and that
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: With an organic, there's so much involved
in the production and decomposition time
[SPEAKER_01]: and all these things of the forest
materials and the peat and the aging of
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that it's very hard for all those
pieces to line up all of the time exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: the way that you expect and have expected
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So consistency would be the biggest driver
of looking for a source of any sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: organic input.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like look at the historical data,
see if they do certificates of analysis
[SPEAKER_01]: like quarterly, weekly, see if they'll
just give them to you if you request them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, and make sure that you're
following up on it because a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: times people find a good organic input and
then they keep using it without realizing
[SPEAKER_01]: that six months ago they changed this or
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why everything in their grow has
changed because of that change that the
[SPEAKER_01]: formulation that was in the formulation
but they weren't privy to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really have to stay on top of your
supply chain when you're using organic
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs and look for products that have
known good consistency, known testing
[SPEAKER_01]: data, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people these days are
using the organic blends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the organic fertilizer, it's a blend of
different amendments and they're typically
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the top dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main way to do it is the top dress or
you can do the initial amending of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil to begin but when the plant is
growing in the grow pot, they're top
[SPEAKER_00]: dressing that organic fertilizer and then
they're watering that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of folks say that's the easiest way
to do it and you can't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I'm hearing otherwise that you
can overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you overdo it with organics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can absolutely over apply any
fertilizer to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like food.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can overeat anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can even over drink water and plants
are the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's harder obviously to overdose your
plants on a certain say phosphorus because
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes so long typically for that to
become available in a root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unless you do some sort of an egregious
over application of something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you're typically not going to see
toxicity symptoms or any sort of like
[SPEAKER_01]: ailments of the plant but certain things
like nitrogen, calcium, those can be
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely apparent when you do have
toxicity and the problem with organic
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture too is remedying those
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say you can absolutely over apply
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put triple the amount of fish emulsion
into the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start to get weird growth of like
pathogenic cultures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have this overabundance of nitrogen
going into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves are getting leathery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrogen cycles getting weird within the
rhizosphere as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get those symptoms,
but how do you alleviate that?
[SPEAKER_01]: In rockwool with nitrates, you just water
through maybe 30 minutes for about four,
[SPEAKER_01]: like 30 minute cycles for about like,
you know, four or five hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can be assured that that cube
is well flushed enough that your next
[SPEAKER_01]: application of fertilizer will kind of
reset the balance in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: With an organic with a soil plot with,
you know, organic soils, it's a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult to alleviate those issues just
because of the fact that it's being
[SPEAKER_01]: immobilized by the root zone's ecology,
like the things living in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being immobilized by the types of
substrate that's in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can't leave that substrate because
it's stuck to the particles in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally you'd have to use things
like maybe potassium carbonate or
[SPEAKER_01]: activated charcoal or things like that to
kind of deal with toxicities in your root
[SPEAKER_01]: zone and kind of help sequester things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're never going to get the fast
bounce back that you would in like a
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponic situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with organic inputs, you can overuse
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to make sure that you kind
of do the lowest application possible and
[SPEAKER_01]: move up from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, with organic inputs and
organic agriculture, it's really time
[SPEAKER_01]: intensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to know your cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're trying to blast through them
and try to treat it like hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to be going back and forth
from either end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, start slow and moving up and not
over applying would be the best technique
[SPEAKER_01]: with organic agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you can definitely over apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's no question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to flip things over to pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH is something that is closely monitored
by those folks growing with synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people that say you have to have
that pH in that certain range in order for
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant to uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on the organic side of things,
you hear a majority of people saying they
[SPEAKER_00]: ignore pH completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if they are growing organically
with healthy root zones, their non caring
[SPEAKER_01]: is well founded.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the roots on ecology is there to
provide the ideal conditions for that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's set up correctly, it will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in hydroponics, we're starting to
come around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people are starting to come around to
the fact that it's not this insanely
[SPEAKER_01]: precise range that you have to be in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fairly wide range because even in
an inert setting like Rockwell,
[SPEAKER_01]: you still have endogenous cultures like
cultures in the air that will land in that
[SPEAKER_01]: root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as they live and die, you know,
they acidify the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do cellular respiration and push out
CO2 as well, which goes into the substrate
[SPEAKER_01]: water and acidifies it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's lots of pathways naturally for
your media and roots own to balance its pH
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to water outside of the
range of maybe like six to seven or like
[SPEAKER_01]: five to like seven and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: But within those ranges, typically the
root zone can recover as long as it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: like a prolonged exposure to like a wild
outlier pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to mineral nutrition,
guys, you know, obviously they'll add
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphoric acid or potassium hydroxide
with organic production.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still do pH adjustments pretty
easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: You add things like dolomitic lime to the
substrate if you need a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: basicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's certain fertilizers like down to
earth makes a good acid mix that's
[SPEAKER_01]: acidifying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can even add things like citric acid,
which you can buy on relisted at a small
[SPEAKER_01]: rate with whatever nutrient or top dress
formula to add a little bit of acid
[SPEAKER_01]: acidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sulfur products are a great way to add a
little bit of acidity into your soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of increase that roots on ecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, you need to adjust your pH in an
inert situation more, and you definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have to worry about it as much in a
soil setting, but it is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just know that if you have a healthy
roots on ecology and you're plants are set
[SPEAKER_01]: up with a good substrate or media,
then the pH will balance itself out as
[SPEAKER_01]: long as you're not wildly out of the range
of typical like rainwater or natural water
[SPEAKER_01]: that we find standing on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody's water source is over 7.5
pH and they're growing with organic
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs, do you recommend that they pH down
that water before doing the soil drench?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or could they just add in that water
that's above 7.5 pH?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a tricky question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what else is in the water,
if it's bicarbonates or if it's sodium
[SPEAKER_01]: bicarbonates or if it's just like
standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, if your pH is that high,
then that also means that your total
[SPEAKER_01]: dissolved solids are high too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd really want to take a look at the
quality of your well water at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's just like say calcium and other
kind of beneficial kind of secondaries and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just a bunch of bicarbonate bringing
it up, as long as you've amended your bed
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly, there should be no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know like say the water has this
amount of bicarbonate in it and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to apply this much water to that
land, then you should maybe know how much
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur you want to amend to that bed so
that over the course of that watering
[SPEAKER_01]: year, you're going to have enough of a
buffering capacity naturally built into
[SPEAKER_01]: that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like that are considerations you
have to do before and after even the
[SPEAKER_01]: watering happens to answer something like
that, I feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's hard to go roundabout and not
answer your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That topic in particular is super
controversial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I had mentioned to lower the pH in
the past in one of my videos and there was
[SPEAKER_00]: just an uproar of people going organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like pH down doesn't exist in
nature and blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of organic growers that
actually do have a water source above 7.5
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're just putting in their soil and
apparently not having issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I'd ask that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your thoughts on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it really depends on the soil and
how you're watering things like that.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how about EC or PPM?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another thing that when you're
growing with synthetic nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: people tend to monitor more closely than
growing organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think when growing organics,
you should just be completely hands off
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to the EC and PPM or do you
think that should be monitored as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's difficult in like grow ag,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're doing organic agriculture in
pots or in containers, then absolutely I
[SPEAKER_01]: would monitor the EC of what you're what
you're putting on and what you're what's
[SPEAKER_01]: coming off of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really going to tell you basically
what's going to the plant because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: basically a simple math equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have this much nitrates and then you
put it on the plant and then it at the end
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're watering, you have this much
nitrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe in the course of a couple of
days, you take the average of those
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers and you say like, oh, yeah,
so it's using this much nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be just as useful in a soil
world as it is in hydroponic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can control it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can control the inputs a lot more
precisely in hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a little bit more of a
longer wave function when it comes to your
[SPEAKER_01]: corrections in organic agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the potential to make those
corrections are still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So monitoring your EC is very important,
especially if you're doing, like you said,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, water with like seven point five pH,
because like I said, that probably means
[SPEAKER_01]: you have a ton of dissolved solids in
there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have a ton of dissolved solids,
you want to make sure that you're not over
[SPEAKER_01]: applying the salty probably calcium or
maybe even sodium laden water onto an
[SPEAKER_01]: organic bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of different little
considerations when it comes to like the
[SPEAKER_01]: EC and what that EC is made of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I typically don't recommend
people use PPM as a measurement of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient concentration in their solution,
because I mean, what scale is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, are you using the 500 or the
700 scale?
[SPEAKER_01]: What size particle?
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you using a blue lab meter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you using an EC meter to measure that
PPM?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all it's doing is taking the EC
data and multiplying it by a number,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So PPM is very hard to judge.
[SPEAKER_01]: The true measure of like a PPM number
would be to take that liquid, go get an
[SPEAKER_01]: EC, get it analyzed, and then find out
exactly what's in it at what
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't like to use PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: EC is just electrical conductivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much salt is in this solution?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much ionic bonds got broken into this
liquid?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is, I think, a better indicator
of plant health on the fly or root zone
[SPEAKER_01]: health on the fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once your EC ranges are out of
range, that's when you can really like
[SPEAKER_01]: take that water and get it tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, ideally you would do periodic
tests testing anyway, but that EC is gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be a simpler indicator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you know what's going on your
plants and your plants are growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can kind of assume that it's
taking up at least the minimum of the
[SPEAKER_01]: balanced nutrition in order to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can kind of assume that what your
leachate is gonna come out as is typically
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you start to see deficiencies
or you start to see issues in uptake,
[SPEAKER_01]: you do that leachate test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're still within like a healthy
leachate EC range of maybe 0.3 or 3 to 7,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you take that water into for testing
and you go, oh, this is only 0.5 EC,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's like literally all phosphorus in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to really dial back the
phosphorus, dial everything else up a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit, and then do a leachate test on
a different pot a couple of days later and
[SPEAKER_01]: then see where we're at at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can kind of see that your
number of balancing out, your phosphate
[SPEAKER_01]: leachate goes down and it balances out
with all your other macronutrients that
[SPEAKER_01]: you should expect to fall out in a healthy
root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, EC measuring, and monitoring
absolutely is critical in both regular
[SPEAKER_01]: conventional hydroponics or in
conventional like soil or, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: like container soil grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's harder to measure, of course,
in like row agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually you just, you go at scale and you
let it rip for those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do soil tests beforehand, you make all
the necessary calculations, you plan your
[SPEAKER_01]: applications, and yeah, you just set it on
autopilot, you let it rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a controlled environment where you
can control your inputs, whether it's in
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and pots or rockwool or any inert
substrate, having that EC input output
[SPEAKER_01]: readout is extremely helpful and critical
in dialing in a new shrink program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the record, I was born and raised on
PPM measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should probably switch over to EC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Simpler, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got two numbers, that's all you need,
and then decimal points sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to circle back to balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've mentioned that quite a few
times throughout this episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we know that things need to be
balanced in the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have an excess of some cations,
it can lock out other cations,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the most common lockouts
that are out there, and how do people
[SPEAKER_00]: resolve these lockouts and prevent them
from happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: It really depends on how you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in a hydroponic inert media,
a lot of these like lockout or imbalance
[SPEAKER_01]: situations can be really corrected on the
fly just by flushing the substrate out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rockwool, of course, is going to be the
easiest or some sort of expanded glass,
[SPEAKER_01]: but even in Cocoa Coir or even in peat,
you can flush your substrates through and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of reset and start reapplying your
base formula to kind of reset that media.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to, like I mentioned
earlier, in a soil substrate, it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit harder because you have
different particulates that hold on to
[SPEAKER_01]: different ions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They promote different cultures growing in
the media, which can also hold on to
[SPEAKER_01]: different nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to maybe preventing a
lockout or trying to at least diagnose a
[SPEAKER_01]: lockout, one thing that we usually
recommend is look at your environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: data first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the times we've seen lockouts
can happen from environments being too
[SPEAKER_01]: cold, too wet, not enough light,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If all of your environmental data is good,
then at that point, and at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: you probably want to dial your nutrient
program just back, just simply back and
[SPEAKER_01]: then start doing leachate testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you dial your nutrient program back,
then you can kind of be assured that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not locking anything out and that
increased volume of water is maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: flushing out something that may have been
accumulating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at that point, you can kind of
get your leaf tissue tests or kind of get
[SPEAKER_01]: a baseline idea of what's in your
substrate as you're applying new
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer solution and see if that
deficiency comes back.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the times we've seen like
deficiencies arise from fertigation
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques, like how the fertilizers are
being applied more so than the
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration of the fertilizers
themselves, especially nowadays with all
[SPEAKER_01]: of these formulations kind of getting
dialed in more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like growers are putting too much
calcium and it's locking out the
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more about like growers are putting
too much of everything and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: watering too many times a day and so the
root zone is either waterlogged or their
[SPEAKER_01]: watering periods are too far apart and
they have too hard of a dryback and that
[SPEAKER_01]: can really kind of upset the uptake kind
of balance within the root zone as it
[SPEAKER_01]: prunes itself and has to grow back new
shoots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the general health of the plant is
going to kind of like, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: comes down to knowing the baseline of how
that cultivar grows and then knowing that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're applying a certain amount
of blank.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you dial that back, then you can't
be over applying anything and then from
[SPEAKER_01]: there, like for me, I would do the leaf
tissue testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's not available at that point,
you'd see if that deficiency persists and
[SPEAKER_01]: if elder deficiencies come arise,
you dial your nutrient program back up and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you'd see if it was an environmental
factor or if it was in fact a nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's very obvious, like one thing that
I've seen very obviously is magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start to get that intravenous
chlorosis on the leaves, things like that
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of the times guys will increase
their magnesium and it just doesn't get,
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't improve and then you find out like
they don't ever have dryback in their root
[SPEAKER_01]: zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using like a plastic pot without
any drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the times we've seen a lot of
these lockout issues go back to
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental factors and just growth
environment of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do have a nutrient kind of
imbalance in hydro, you usually flush and
[SPEAKER_01]: reset in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to amend with, yeah, it's
difficult in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd have to add, if it's a product that
can be sequestered by activated charcoal,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barring that heavy flushes with water work
too, but you know, you're going to stress
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant out a lot doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas in a inert media, typically you
get faster dryback.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not going to stress the plant out
too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that answers that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, lots of good information for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing actually made me think of
another question, which is you mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about how the
temperature, the varying of temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, whether the temperature be too
high or too low, how that impacts
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition and nutrient uptake?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, this is a big thing that
happened when everyone switched from HIDs
[SPEAKER_01]: to LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've realized they have to change their
nutrient programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to change their room parameters
because the rooms are less hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So heat in and of itself is energy too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only do you need the light energy
to drive photosynthesis, but the kinetic
[SPEAKER_01]: energy from the heat of the room moves the
water molecules in the room and helps
[SPEAKER_01]: those processes out as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's almost like a catalyst in
all of those processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So heat definitely plays a factor in the
transpiration rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It triggers stress responses and kind of
growth responses in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your rooms are too cold or if
they're honestly too cold or too hot,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have interruptions in the
metabolism of the plant, which is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: interrupt the uptake of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you get an interruption in the
uptake, you're continually applying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when you start to get the issues
of if this plant is locked out because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's dry for half of the day and you start
to keep applying more, it's not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: use up all of those nutrients during that
day while the light is hitting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the environmental factories,
your soil moisture content and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the temperature of the room have a huge
role to play in the nutrient uptake and
[SPEAKER_01]: transpiration ability of your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, like I said, if you're too cold,
the plants really don't have enough energy
[SPEAKER_01]: to move a lot of water through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the water itself is low energy,
so it doesn't really want to move up and
[SPEAKER_01]: through the plant as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's too hot, then you have too much
water transpiring out.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the times, if it's too hot,
your root zones get uneven dry back or too
[SPEAKER_01]: much dry back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can stop the uptake of water,
which stops the uptake of nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: which also at that point starts to get
accumulation in your root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your EC starts to spike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once your EC spikes and your EC gets too
salty, then the root zone is too salty for
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: That affects your uptake immensely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you start to see your really
spindly plants with the tiny golf balls,
[SPEAKER_01]: just going down the stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to medicinal plants or like
in a tomato plant, you get these tiny
[SPEAKER_01]: small fruits, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the EC controls a lot of how your plant
grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the EC is really a function of the
water content in the soil too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the water content itself is kind of
affected by the environmental conditions
[SPEAKER_01]: like the temperature and the irrigation
frequency, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, your environmental factors,
like I said, when it goes back to
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies or nutrient problems,
we always circle first to your environment
[SPEAKER_01]: to see if your environment is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's not the case, then a lot of the
times changes in the environment will
[SPEAKER_01]: correct or increase the uptake within the
root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they can get back onto their
standard nutrition program as they planned
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the ideal temperature range to
keep your environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's cultivar-dependent,
especially for medicinal plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's anywhere within the ranges of
like 65 all the way up to 85.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that magic VPD number comes in
when it comes to those types of outlier
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really want to monitor your humidity
in those temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, cultivar-dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain cultivars do great in 65.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain cultivars don't grow in 65.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain cultivars stunt out and they don't
grow at 85.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain cultivars veg out and bush like
crazy at 85.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say it's definitely
cultivar-dependent, but the ranges for
[SPEAKER_01]: like our most common medicinal plants
would be anywhere from like 65 to about
[SPEAKER_01]: 85.
[SPEAKER_01]: And life cycle plays a huge part in that,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because temperature also, you're trying to
mimic the natural temperature cycle for an
[SPEAKER_01]: annual plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, in those earlier spring and
summer months, the veg months,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd have higher temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the flower senescence months and
the harvest months, you definitely have
[SPEAKER_01]: cooler temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the inner metabolisms within the plant
are triggered by those changes in
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to consider the
temperature shift within a growth cycle of
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal plants as well as just the
baseline temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a different type of feeding
that I want to touch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of people will mix in
their synthetic nutrients into water,
[SPEAKER_00]: then do a soil drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other folks will do a top dressing of
organic inputs, for example, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll water them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's another way to go about
feeding, which is foliar feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about how foliar feeding works
and what type of foliar feeding can
[SPEAKER_00]: growers do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So foliar feeding is basically trying to
directly apply mineral nutrition to the
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of the plant that seemingly need it,
that can't get translocated from other
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of the plant, or it's not getting
from the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I definitely have an opinion
about foliar applications of mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition, especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like it's not something that
I believe growers should lean on for their
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition program.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely just a general part of any
part of crop cultivation, but it's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like you'd want to feed a child a fully
balanced nutrition from the get-go into
[SPEAKER_01]: his mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to feed him only macaroni
and cheese and then he gets scurvy and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you got to take him to the doctor to
get a direct injection of vitamin C every
[SPEAKER_01]: month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of, if you consider having
a constant foliar feed program,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's kind of the type of nutrition
program you're planning out for your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want that nutrition to come because
we're not growing orchids or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like plants that are growing up in tree
canopies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're growing plants with full root zones
and root systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to deliver their nutrition that
way, the more conventional way,
[SPEAKER_01]: the way that is kind of a pathway laid out
by the plant, rather than using foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the times, foliar applications
applications would come when that baseline
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition program seems to have a
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you specifically identify that
deficiency, whether it is calcium or
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium or this or that zinc,
for example, is actually common in
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you find those specific deficiencies,
then yeah, a foliar application is an
[SPEAKER_01]: absolute powerhouse tool to get that
mineral nutrition directly onto those
[SPEAKER_01]: areas of the plant where that particular
nutrient can't get translocated up into
[SPEAKER_01]: from the other tissues of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But barring that, foliar applications,
especially on an ornamental plant or a cut
[SPEAKER_01]: flower product like medicinal plants
typically are, you want to reduce any
[SPEAKER_01]: application of any product to the plant,
especially after influences have set,
[SPEAKER_01]: after flowers are there because that is
the end product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anything that you add exogenously can
typically degrade or denude the quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't want to apply as you want to
reduce applications as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why beneficial insects or
beneficial mites are so great.
[SPEAKER_01]: They allow you to have good pest control
over threshold numbers without any
[SPEAKER_01]: applications of sprays or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no possible problem of frass
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I think BCAs are taking over
on the IPM side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes to foliar applications,
we're, in my opinion, seeing less products
[SPEAKER_01]: market themselves as foliar products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of products kind of try to roll
all of that value into their mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is, there are certain foliar
products, especially amino acids that we
[SPEAKER_01]: found that are not part of a mineral
nutrition program, but do actually have
[SPEAKER_01]: added benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the times we see it a lot in turf
or when I was in the ag world,
[SPEAKER_01]: we saw it a lot in turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's a certain amino, proline,
for example, you spray that on grass and
[SPEAKER_01]: that helps trigger pressure and all the
blades stand straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so we're finding that there are
other products that we can apply to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants foliarly that would give the
benefits of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't really get through a nutrition
program in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the products that I'd
probably suggest.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wanted to do a foliar program,
you roll those into a foliar program with
[SPEAKER_01]: some base IPM products, but also know that
foliar products work best with adjuvants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't have like a spread or
sticker like a organosilicone adjuvant,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you, if you don't have like even like
an acid chelator or something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: say the pH of your foliar spray is off or
you're not agitating as like, there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of considerations that you have to
lock in for a foliar program to be truly
[SPEAKER_01]: effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once those things are locked in and you've
truly found a product that works best as a
[SPEAKER_01]: foliar application, good on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my opinion, foliar nutrition is,
is yeah, it's a shot in the arm when it
[SPEAKER_01]: should have been just part of the meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the only time I ever really do
foliar feeding is when I have magnesium
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency and I'm in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't spray in flour, but magnesium
deficiency in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use Epsom salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So magnesium sulfate, put that into water,
spray the plants and that helps with the
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know some people who will do a foliar
feeding of silica, not so much that it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes into the plant that way, but I
believe that it helps with some resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: to pottery mildew in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have too many details on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know some folks that will use
actually foliar feed compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for micro purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get those lactobacillus cultures in
there, get those healthy cultures on
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you're doing it at a kind of a
sane rate that really doesn't affect the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silica, obviously that's been done for
quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: That directly, if it's small enough,
can kind of go through into the plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: be absorbed foliarly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just going to say with the
magnesium sulfate too, you can foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: that, but you could simply top dress a
little bit too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'd probably get the same
results in about three or four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can even add a little bit more to
your fertigation program as kind of a last
[SPEAKER_01]: step amendment to the batch tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll melt down easily enough if it's
magnesium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really doesn't affect your PPMs too
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that's something that you could do
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, there's other ways to get
those benefits without risking someone
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe doing a improper application or over
applying something foliarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are coming up towards the end of the
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to give you an opportunity to let
us know what else should gardeners know
[SPEAKER_00]: about plant nutrition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything that we didn't cover in
this episode that you think we should
[SPEAKER_00]: cover?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one thing that I've kind of
wanted to scream from the rooftops a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: is, you know, your mineral nutrition,
your nitrates, your phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_01]: your potassium, that is the same molecule,
regardless of bottle, salt, brand,
[SPEAKER_01]: country of origin, all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really comes down to understanding
what you put on your plants more than kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of, in my opinion, trusting a product at
this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, there was no information
about medicinal plants, no information
[SPEAKER_01]: about certain specialty crops that we
could go off of and have kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: historical data to see if we're within
ranges for certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that that information is being found
out in places like Canada and like even
[SPEAKER_01]: here in the U.S., that type of information
needs to be applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I come from the ag industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I come from the ag world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's not a cotton farmer in the
world that would overspend on a nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they, sometimes they make,
you know, like less than a hundred bucks
[SPEAKER_01]: per acre on their cotton.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, it's tough out there in the
ag world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that is also a really good
point in sustainability too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to make sure that we're not
following the same mistakes of ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from the get-go, we're trying to be as
efficient as possible with our nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery so that we're not setting a bad
example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it needs to be done properly with the
right science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that starts with people understanding
just the basic science of how plants take
[SPEAKER_01]: up mineral nutrition, how, what the basic
needs are for plants, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: very similar to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need three big things and then all
the vitamins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just need to find the right balance
of those and then find the right way to
[SPEAKER_01]: deliver that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we shouldn't be too hung up on
brands and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should just try to find the best way to
mishmash everything to make things work
[SPEAKER_01]: and try to be the most efficient as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's some really, really good
advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can listeners find you and what do you
have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: I should be, you should see me in a couple
more Canna Cribs and Deep Roots episodes
[SPEAKER_01]: on the Growers Network YouTube channel.

that stuff.

and you'd be happy to answer any questions
[SPEAKER_01]: directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this has been an insightful episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super glad that you decided to sit
down and talk with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned so much from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You explain things very well, very,
very beginner friendly manner,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion, and hope I can have you on
again in the future because I think we can
[SPEAKER_00]: continue this conversation or even go
towards some other areas we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge of, such as IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be happy to come back on.
