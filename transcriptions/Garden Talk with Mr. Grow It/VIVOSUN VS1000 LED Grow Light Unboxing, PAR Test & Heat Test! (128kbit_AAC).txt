[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka MrGrowIt,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: VivoSun sent me over their brand new LED
grow light, this is the VS-1000 LED grow
[SPEAKER_00]: light, and in this video I'm going to
unbox the unit, I'm going to test the
[SPEAKER_00]: power output, and I'm also going to do a
heat test on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go over all of the specs
that this grow light has, but I will leave
[SPEAKER_00]: a link to this grow light in the
description section below, so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: click on that link if you want to learn
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, first thing out the box is a power
cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got this grow light before it
was released, and some of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: they include in the box, they didn't
include in mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: What also comes in the box is LED grow
room glasses, rope ratchet hangers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and lastly is the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the power test, I'm going to use the
Apogee MQ500 power meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 389 nanometers to
692 nanometers, and the measurements are
[SPEAKER_00]: in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do these power tests just to give you a
general idea of what the power output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take measurements in grow tents,
which have reflective walls, that could
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the numbers, so just keep that in
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many growers use this information to get
an understanding of what their light
[SPEAKER_00]: distance should be from the plants,
and also some growers find this beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: to match up the numbers from what they're
reporting on their listing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Amazon listing shows a max coverage
area of four feet by four feet,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a core coverage area of three feet by
three feet, but this grow light is really
[SPEAKER_00]: more suited for a two foot by two foot
grow space, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to try to keep my power meter
in a two foot by two foot space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take measurements at three
different distances, 12 inches away,
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 inches away, and 20 inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plugged the LED grow light into my
kilowatt meter, and it shows 0.8 amps,
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling 94.8 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comment section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a reminder that there is a link to
this grow light down in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below, so you can learn more about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed it, please click that
thumbs up, and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching,
and until next time, peace.
See you next time.
