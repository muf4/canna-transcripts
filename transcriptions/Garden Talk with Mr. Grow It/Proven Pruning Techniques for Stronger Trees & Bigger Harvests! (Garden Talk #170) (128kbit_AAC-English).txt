[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_01]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow It,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're tuned in to the Garden Talk

[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Chris, for having me on
your show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today we're going to talk all about
pruning, and this is something that you
[SPEAKER_01]: are regarded as an expert in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have lots of experience doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're an award-winning author,
and you've got just so much experience
[SPEAKER_01]: with so many different trees, and that's
what we're going to get into today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, like we were talking about
before, we start recording, a majority of
[SPEAKER_01]: my audience really focuses on growing
medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's going to be interesting
for them to hear this, because there are
[SPEAKER_01]: so many different ways to do the pruning
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on what plant you're
growing, well, you could do things a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit differently from plant to
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's going to be really
interesting for my audience to hear about
[SPEAKER_01]: the different ways to do things,
and potentially have some takeaways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compare how they do their pruning to what
you're mentioning, and then potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: take away some best practices and
implement in their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really excited for this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too deep into the topic,
something we'd like to do is an
[SPEAKER_01]: introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always chuckle when people call me an
expert in pruning or fruit trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I have been doing this for 15 years,
but I started later in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up not touching the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't plant seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: My background is as a journalist,
a BBC-trained journalist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lived in England, traveled the world,
did some really interesting things.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came back to Canada, which is where
I live, I met my husband Cliff,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's from Trinidad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Trinidad, you plant any seed,
the tree pops up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any trees, any shrubs, any everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can grow everything there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The climate is warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we moved in together,
he looked at the backyard and he said,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, we can plant some good stuff back
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, no, we are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way, because you're going to plant
stuff and I'm going to have to take care
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we negotiated back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he said, okay, well, I'll do some
just a little bit of tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go out that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole backyard is filled with tomato
plants and God knows what else he planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was so mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that whole summer I fell in love with
gardening because I love food and I love
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh fruits and it tasted so much better
than any of the things you can get in the
[SPEAKER_00]: supermarket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the long story short is I ended up
studying garden design.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I did that, I realized that what
spoke to me was trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fruit trees are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only do they do all the wonderful
things that trees do, they shade our
[SPEAKER_00]: communities, they beautify our gardens,
they clean our air, but fruit trees feed
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are so generous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that started my adventure where I
planted a community orchard in my local
[SPEAKER_00]: park thinking it was going to be easy
because you know, zucchini plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to weed around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to take care of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomato plants, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trees, you plant them and water them and
just wait for your harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I right, Chris?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ha, you've got this knowing look on your
face, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the end, I realized these trees
I planted were in a public space.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were actually were people who did
not want me to do this project and warned
[SPEAKER_00]: me and said, look, fruit trees can be a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, no, I'll look into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise I'll do it real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the end, it was just a blessing for
me because it ended up being an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting and challenging journey with
pest and disease issues, with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, lack of growth, not enough
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the solution that I could do in the
park was fruit tree pruning because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does everything that you want it to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps to protect the tree from disease
issues and from pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helps encourage growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had planted these puny little trees
that were staying puny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little did I know that pruning wasn't
necessarily making the tree smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was encouraging growth in certain ways
and at certain times of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the most empowering way to learn to
care for your trees is actually the first
[SPEAKER_00]: step.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second step is to prune them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about the chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you don't need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're certain that I might recommend
organic, of course, but pruning is the
[SPEAKER_00]: answer to your prayers and it's a skill
and it can be learned very easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did a great job explaining some of the
reasons why it's so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if there's anything else to
say about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of folks, they'll do it for
bigger yields, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because from my understanding,
some of these, and I'm so new to growing
[SPEAKER_01]: trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of briefly talked about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have five trees in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a fig tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a pomegranate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a bunch of citrus trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a grapefruit, mandarin, lemon,
and lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all different as far as how to prune
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: From my understanding, some of these,
if you let too much fruit go on the
[SPEAKER_01]: branches, that could be a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of want to take off some of
those flower sites, I guess, so you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: produce too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, too many limes on a
particular branch isn't always a good
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could lead to, I guess, smaller fruit,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Potential smaller yield overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us a little bit about how
that works?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything I do, so here I am
relatively 15 years ago, relatively new to
[SPEAKER_00]: growing fruit trees and I'm not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell me to do stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I don't understand why,
I just don't remember to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care about doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the science is where I go for all of
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about it, you also,
you're essentially even feeding your fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: trees when you prune them properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's think of it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I live in a cold climate where we have
a very obvious dormant season.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys also have a dormant season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as obvious, but what it's the
slower, the season where the tree grows
[SPEAKER_00]: slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does is it brings the
nutrients from the leaves down into the
[SPEAKER_00]: root system for storage while it just kind
of settles in and rests for the dormant
[SPEAKER_00]: season or the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens is that if you have a tree
with lots of branches, that little pot of
[SPEAKER_00]: food, the nutrients has to go out to all
those branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the spring, all that, and those
nutrients will go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's say there's 10 branches,
the nutrients, one tenth of the nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: will go to each branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you selectively prune those branches
out, and let's say you only have seven
[SPEAKER_00]: branches left, you've got the same pot of
nutrients in the root system, but each
[SPEAKER_00]: branch gets a larger share of that energy
in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the result is that those branches will
grow longer, get stronger, and be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: support more fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, similarly, if you let that branch
support 10 pieces of fruit, each fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: will get one tenth of the energy that that
branch gets, and they might stay small,
[SPEAKER_00]: they might be a little bit hard,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you thin the fruit, when I see baby
fruitlets on an apple tree or a peach tree
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, if you thin the fruits so
that there are fewer fruits, they have
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of space to grow to be full size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got fewer fruits, there's more
space, and they get a larger share of the
[SPEAKER_00]: energy in that branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it all makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my new book, I just wrote a new book,
it's called Fruit Tree Pruning,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Science and Art of Cultivating Healthy
Fruit Trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talk about all this stuff as the way
when we work with a fruit tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not just making it smaller by
pruning it, because we're not,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes we're making it bigger,
we are helping the fruit tree manage its
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So winter pruning spurs or stimulates
vigorous growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Summer pruning is a little different,
and that I can talk to you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested about that,
different time of year, the cycle is a
[SPEAKER_00]: little different, the effect is different
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But does that answer your question as to
why some trees, if you leave a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit on them, you're just going to get
hard, kind of not really very interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do your part of the fruit tree
care, you're working with the tree
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborating together to make a quality
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, let's get a little bit deeper
into the ideal time of year.
[SPEAKER_01]: To prune, I know that's going to be
dependent on what tree or plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you give us some more information
on that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course it depends on what climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the month will be different here than
it will be for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know where your listeners are
from, if they're from all over North
[SPEAKER_00]: America, but the science is the same
wherever you live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the month, the timing is
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a minute ago, I talked about
winter pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So winter pruning is when you've got,
and it's really happens like late winter
[SPEAKER_00]: just before the buds start opening in the
spring or the end of the dormancy season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got the nutrients in the root
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've pruned out some branches,
then each branch gets more energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows bigger and stronger and it can
support more fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens, Chris, if you say,
okay, I'm not going to do winter pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let the energy in the root
system come up into the tree and I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to let it push out buds and flowers and
fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let this tree run a whole
marathon with all its branches,
[SPEAKER_00]: all 10 branches, all 100 branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens then is you wait for the
tree to use up all the energy and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: make some cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of effect would it have?
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point, it's kind of like,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have kids, but I understand that
if you could give kids chocolate or
[SPEAKER_00]: something before bedtime, even if you have
chocolate before bedtime or coffee or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, you're going to be running
around in circles and you're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: want to go to sleep, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially you've got your tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's run a marathon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's run around in circles and it's tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if at that point it's used up all the
energy, all the energy in its root system,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you make some cuts, there's not really
that much energy to go up into the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two interesting things happen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one is it doesn't spurn lots of new
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll spur a little growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of thing is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got like that big old cherry
tree that is way too big and you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring it down in size, then you want to do
it after blossom time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually do our cherry trees at harvest
time because it's, you know, early summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before we have our community harvest
in the park, I go out with the pole
[SPEAKER_00]: pruners, I go out and we saw off certain
branches because we know what structure
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to create.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can even take the cherries off the
high branches, but we know that the tree
[SPEAKER_00]: will not respond by getting even bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So summer pruning slows growth down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps you to keep your tree compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's another interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to do with hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hormones are these chemicals that
tell the tree what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certain hormones like oxen hormones,
and I think gibberellin hormones are very
[SPEAKER_00]: active in the late winter, early spring,
and they want the tree to get bigger and
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So winter pruning spurs growth because
those hormones are really active.
[SPEAKER_00]: By summer, the oxen hormones aren't so
active, they've gone slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's another type of hormone that
likes to direct the energy towards what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Towards fruit production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you prune in the summer,
the early summer, then you are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: telling the tree, hey, kiddo, put some
energy towards either this year's fruit or
[SPEAKER_00]: creating wonderful buds for next year's
fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it so fascinating the way these
instructions are going on in the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I think one of the themes in my
life is that growing fruit trees is a
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration between the grower and the
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: These trees are grafted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not necessarily out there in
nature, just like they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they are, they're not there to
produce yummy, delicious fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just there to reproduce and drop
their seeds and have more trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we want the yummy, delicious fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to know when to prune and how
to prune to create that beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So winter versus summer pruning,
I want to add an extra little point in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can prune until mid summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in a hot climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You certainly do not want to prune on the
really, really hot days because every time
[SPEAKER_00]: you make a cut on the tree, you're
actually creating a wound and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: protected under there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the extreme heat or extreme cold can
basically kill the cells in there because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just not protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like me going out into the cold
without a big perca on, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the same way, you want to stop your
pruning mid summer or when it gets too
[SPEAKER_00]: hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually we don't prune again until the
early spring the following years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you think of it as a spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start to prune usually just before
spring, dormancy just before spring,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we end mid summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we take a break.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a jujube tree as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mention that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that one I was advised to prune
during winter time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went ahead and did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have a fig tree, which was recently
planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't need any pruning, but I know
that is ideal to be a winter time before
[SPEAKER_01]: any sort of sprouts happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on my lemon tree was told that also
it's winter time is ideal before starts to
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: New growth comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I missed that window.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flower started to occur on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some new growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went and pruned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you saying that everything is going to
be okay with that or has harm been done at
[SPEAKER_01]: that point since the plant has already
been flowering?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I'm not an expert in citrus
because we can't really grow it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had an indoor lemon tree before,
which was absolutely adorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got too big for our house though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to give it away and find it a new
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making correct pruning cuts with
a clean pruner that's been sanitized and
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilized, you're not pruning a diseased
lemon tree and then pruning your lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would spread disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the growing season, the tree starts
to heal the wound pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They create cells to cover up those
wounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a big old branch on a big old apple
tree or whatever, that will take longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why in the early years,
that's the best time to sculpt your tree
[SPEAKER_00]: to create that supportive structure for
supporting a heavy harvest and for keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: the tree open and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those big old branches take longer
to heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But little cuts like that, they will heal
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you don't want to do is prune on a
rainy day if you're in a climate where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of fungal diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those fungal diseases spread on
the rainy days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to harvest some scion wood for
propagating my apple trees in the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only time I could do it,
because the buds are starting to open,
[SPEAKER_00]: was Saturday morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go out and I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later in the day, it starts to rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh, my poor baby,
my poor tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But luckily, it is disease resistant for a
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's resistant to some fungal diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is, don't prune in the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't prune on rainy days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're pruning close to the active
growing season, it should heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it won't be good is if you prune in
the fall, when growth has slowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is that it's not going to
necessarily have the energy to heal
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have an open wound all through
the dormant season.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how about pruning dead wood?
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I have a mixed audience
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are beginners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some don't even know what dead wood is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you explain what dead wood is?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then is that traditionally only pruned
during wintertime, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: or is that safe to prune throughout just
as long as not wet, like you mentioned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, safe to prune dead wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dead wood is a dead branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes naturally a tree has a branch
that dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diseased wood is also something that if
you see certain fungal diseases,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is good to do some research,
by the way, on the type of tree you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to find out, every tree has like let's
say five big diseases that it can suffer
[SPEAKER_00]: from or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know how to recognize those
diseases, you can see them right away and
[SPEAKER_00]: often pruning out an infected branch,
putting it in a bag, getting it off the
[SPEAKER_00]: site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put it in your compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That alone will help you get rid of the
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do that pretty much at any time
of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in that case, it's the best of
two not great choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you might have if it's a disease
branch, an open wound, but you know you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting rid of a pathogen correctly,
getting it off the site so it won't spread
[SPEAKER_00]: to your other trees or within that tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, dead wood anytime because it's
dead, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Broken branches, you know, these things
can cause more problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a broken branch, for instance,
a branch that's sort of flopping off a
[SPEAKER_00]: tree, starting to rip the bark in the
wind, you know, that branch, a heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: branch can rip the bark all the way down
the tree, preventing the tree from,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, fully feeding itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so you have to sometimes you
have to do these things at whatever time
[SPEAKER_00]: of year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned tools to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you break it down for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of the best tools to use for
pruning?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can they be sanitized?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that they should be cleanly
sanitized and maintained.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you start off with most trees with hand
pruners, you know, whether you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: citrus, whether you're doing deciduous
trees, your hand pruners are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Falcos are fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there's other companies
that do very nice hand pruners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's for the little cuts,
especially when they're young.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll have those anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: To sanitize them, all you need to do is
bring some rubbing alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them here in a little sprayer
or you can put it in a sprayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I do is before I tackle any tree,
I will spray the blades with rubbing
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol and take a clean, clean rag and
wipe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm doing a whole bunch of trees,
I can bring a small bucket, put the
[SPEAKER_00]: blades, you know, all the hand pruners or
whatever in the bucket of with like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, an inch of alcohol at the bottom
and then take it out, wipe it with a clean
[SPEAKER_00]: rag and work on the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine times out of 10, all you need to do
is clean your pruners before you start the
[SPEAKER_00]: first tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do that whole tree and then put them
back in the alcohol, go do the next tree
[SPEAKER_00]: and wipe them clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from tree to tree, you need to clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a disease called fire blight,
which is nasty and is a bacterial disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that case, you need to clean your
pruners and sanitize them in between cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see one fire blighty branch,
you need to remove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go back as far as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You snip it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then put it in a bag, take it off the
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't put in your compost and then clean
your pruners again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the next branch because you could be
spreading it from branch to branch in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly though, before a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other tools I use are loppers,
those two handed tools, which are great
[SPEAKER_00]: for thicker branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get extendable loppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fiskars has a pair that I like and they
help you to reach a little bit higher in
[SPEAKER_00]: the tree and they can cut branches up to a
couple of inches thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other tool, of course,
I have a beautiful hand saw for older
[SPEAKER_00]: branches called a silky hand saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silky is the best brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a super strong upper body and
silky meat goes through a thick branch
[SPEAKER_00]: like butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to press.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to use muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just gently, you know, saw back and
forth and it's so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally I have pull pruners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of them are from Fiskars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the later weight one myself,
but when your tree, you know, gets a
[SPEAKER_00]: little too big and you can't reach it and
you don't want to jump on a ladder,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can just snip off branches so easily
using these pull printers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of them has a saw attachment and
I have a perfect application for that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I cannot imagine myself using the saw
at the end of a pole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to have to find a friend to
do the sawing on a pole.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, oh my gosh, how precise can you
be?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably also need a lot of upper body
strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the main tools that I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you mentioned alcohol to use to
sanitize.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that's commonly used in
the industry I work with as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people are actually going
more towards bleach, a diluted bleach
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one part bleach to nine parts
water is very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the reasons why is because I
actually had somebody who's specialty in
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses, viroids, DNA, RNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: She came on the podcast and we were
talking and we had a conversation about
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she had mentioned that with viroids in
particular, one of the common ones that's
[SPEAKER_01]: a real scare in my industry is hoplite and
viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were talking about sanitizing tools
in order to prevent it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, alcohol actually makes it
worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to use a bleach cleaning
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wasn't sure if that would be the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with these fruit trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sure if you had any more knowledge
behind using alcohol for sanitizing versus
[SPEAKER_01]: bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the problem with bleach with the tools
that I use and buy, they're not cheap and
[SPEAKER_00]: bleach has stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've told, I can't remember what it's
called.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got it actually in my book of fruit
tree pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can damage the blades and maybe rust
the tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember what the actual problem
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know about that particular
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard about it with fruit
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I make my
priority is whatever I grow, I know what
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential diseases are and pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to know, because if I don't know,
I won't recognize the signs of those
[SPEAKER_00]: problems before they occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the only reason we would do
rubbing alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in your industry, oh my gosh,
for sure, use bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your tools are probably different and
cheaper and smaller, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: hand pruners maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you're going to shell out like
a hundred bucks or whatever, four or more
[SPEAKER_00]: for a pole pruner or whatever,
you just want to be a little more careful
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep the tool in good shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I just also want to say that
something I really hesitated about was
[SPEAKER_00]: sharpening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything in fruit trees I hesitated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hesitated to learn about diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hesitated everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the kind of person that I had to do it
wrong until I realized, oh God,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to do this right because this is
not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was so scared of learning how to
sharpen my tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet I could see that the tools,
as they get older, they make these
[SPEAKER_00]: horrible shaggy cuts that the tree can't
heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sharpening is part of what we do in
our orchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the funnest days is we take out all
our tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some sharpening stones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some little carbide tools and
everybody has fun sharpening the tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tell all the neighborhood,
hey, come out, bring your tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us sharpen the tools for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a sharp, clean tool is what will
make a good, clean cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably just the same thing,
you know, for whatever you're growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you probably also need good sharp tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get a little bit deeper into common
tree shapes that are used when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit tree training.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about some of the most
common ones?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's open center, central
leader.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a few more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Break it down for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my book, Fruit Tree Pruning,
I talk about the two main ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's talk about why, why you even
need a structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't you just selectively pick out of
this branch and that branch?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do public speaking and I was talking to
a group of like a arborist community group
[SPEAKER_00]: or training arborists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before my talk, they had me do a fruit
tree pruning demo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go out to the tree and I start to
talk and I say, okay, so now I'm taking my
[SPEAKER_00]: pruners and I'm going in and I'm about to
make a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not just like, we call it heading
back, shortening a branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not just shortening the branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going in there on this young tree and
thinning out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am cutting out a whole branch right to
the trunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of these arborists looked like she was
going to jump and physically hold me back
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was pruning out a healthy tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: A healthy branch, totally healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this crazy woman removing healthy
branches?
[SPEAKER_00]: As an arborist, you don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you prune out broken branches or
crossing branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not prune out totally healthy
branches, but you do that with fruit tree
[SPEAKER_00]: pruning because you are working to create,
especially when the tree is young,
[SPEAKER_00]: a strong fruit bearing structure for your
tree that has great air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows the canopy to dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't collect moisture and spread
fungal diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that sunlight gets to every single
branch so that it can photosynthesize
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can ripen the fruit properly,
all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we need specific structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just, oh, I got to prune my fruit
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just snip here and snip there because
sometimes you could be making things worse
[SPEAKER_00]: and not better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fruit tree pruning first structure
I learned was called central leader.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that structure became popular in the
early 1900s because it creates a structure
[SPEAKER_00]: where your tree looks a little bit in a
triangle shape, sort of Christmas tree
[SPEAKER_00]: shaped, but there is a, you've got
horizontal branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call them platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first platform of let's say three
to five branches might be at my knee
[SPEAKER_00]: height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like a Christmas tree, those will be
the widest branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next platform might be at my waist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, three to five branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's say if you want one more
platform, maybe it's at my shoulders,
[SPEAKER_00]: three to five branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of these branches is pointing in a
different direction and each of them is
[SPEAKER_00]: chosen so that it's not shading the ones
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So between those, each platform,
you've got like two, two feet,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, of empty space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows the air circulation to go
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you go and you top your tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a beautiful triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine you take a bamboo stick and walk
around just to shorten the branches so
[SPEAKER_00]: that the top ones are not longer than the
bottom ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you shorten the branch,
it's like what we talked about earlier in
[SPEAKER_00]: the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are allowing the energy of that branch
to go to fewer buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, not as long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few more energy for the remaining
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: More chance of getting fruit depending on
the time of year you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those branches get thicker and
stronger because they got a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: energy so they can have more secondary
tree growth, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're creating this kind of chunky,
like thick little branches on the top and
[SPEAKER_00]: on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the branches get thicker and stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2013, we had an ice storm here in
Toronto and big trees were falling down.
[SPEAKER_00]: All over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our little fruit trees, not one broken
branch because we had been pruning them
[SPEAKER_00]: for strength so they could support a heavy
harvest, a little bit of ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they care?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you're creating this really lovely
structure for the tree by removing healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: branches, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're sculpting the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second, that's great for, in my
climate, for apples and any climate,
[SPEAKER_00]: for apples and pears, you can grow you can
grow sour cherries in that central leader
[SPEAKER_00]: format.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow lots of things, apricots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is another structure that people
have used since the beginning of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: since like Roman times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the more traditional vase
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also called open center, where
instead of having that Christmas tree
[SPEAKER_00]: shape with a tall leader at the top,
you know, the tallest branch, you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: the little trunk and then it divides up
into three to five strong branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of those branches after about 36
inches, subdivides into another two
[SPEAKER_00]: branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of those two branches subdivides
into another two branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking at that from the top,
it might look like a bowl or a plate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you're trying to fill up the
space around the tree with lots of growing
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a great structure if you live
in a damp climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot get better air circulation than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so and sunlight penetration,
whatever, all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's awesome for there's certain
types of trees that like plums sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the cultivar, plums just want
to grow into big open bowls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cherries, sweet cherries often want to
grow into this big open center shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on the types of tree you're
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of trees in our park that
we started off our sweet cherries,
[SPEAKER_00]: we started off a central leader with a
central branch trunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like I described to you the
Christmas tree shape, it didn't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, it got a disease on the central
leader.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the end, it just had these
swooshing branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said, oh, let's just turn it into
open center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every tree has its own personality and
its own growing style.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll teach you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And year by year what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The open center that you mentioned is what
a lot of people use for the medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use that we have that one branch
coming out and then everything just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of multiple branches coming from there and
it's kind of kind of comes up and creates
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of an even canopy is what they aim
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely some similarities in what
you're explaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as far as the branch size,
it reminds me of a question that I wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to ask, which was these smaller branches
when you're keeping them, if flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: develop on those smaller branches,
is there concern to like, maybe do you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to remove flower sites on the smaller
branches and keep them on the larger
[SPEAKER_01]: branches that are going to maybe be more
stronger to hold the fruit or is there
[SPEAKER_01]: like a technique revolving around that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's apple trees have spurs and each
spur will have a little cluster of fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got apricot trees have
spurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I started to prune, I was going to
go in there because I had learned it was
[SPEAKER_00]: these were young trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had learned about shaping the trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut all of those off on the apricot
trees, for instance, I cut off all my
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with a spur bearing tree, you
selectively choose which of them to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: and which to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for instance, apricots are notorious
for having a lot of these little spurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you allow each of these spurs to
produce fruit, there will be no room for
[SPEAKER_00]: the fruit to grow to full size.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have a bunch of squished up hard,
hard as rock apricots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take your pruners, when you're
pruning this tree, and it could be with
[SPEAKER_00]: what with us, our apricots are big,
so we do summer pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's say every second spur,
we snip off before it even blossoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what the spurs look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned and in my book, Fruit Tree
Pruning, I also show you pictures of every
[SPEAKER_00]: tree has its own character.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spurs look different in each tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you recognize what they look like and
you thin them even then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not wasting energy making
blossoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if it's later in the season,
they've already made blossoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're reducing the size of the tree
because it's used up that energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're making, you're thinning the
fruit by pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinning the fruit takes two forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either you do it when you're pruning and
removing entire branches is thinning as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or cutting off spurs is thinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you wait until blossom or fruitlet
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's easier to do when the
fruitlets start to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go out to the tree and let's say
you've got clusters of five apples all
[SPEAKER_00]: over your tree and you reduce those
clusters to one or two apples because you
[SPEAKER_00]: want them to be quality apples,
not five crummy little apples that are
[SPEAKER_00]: hard and not fun to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this next question I have might relate
to what you were just talking about with
[SPEAKER_01]: thinning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was advised to ask this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really have a whole lot of
knowledge in regards to it, but can you
[SPEAKER_01]: explain the difference between thinning
cuts and heading cuts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the terms that I learned when I started
were heading back is shortening a branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, how do I even remember
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I remember heading back is
shortening?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I kind of thought, well,
if the tip of the branch is the head,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're cutting off the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just my way of remembering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So heading back is shortening a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinning out is removing the branch to its
origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thinning out would be removing a side
branch all the way back to the trunk of
[SPEAKER_00]: the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are thinning out a branch with
apple trees, with most deciduous trees,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for the collar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a little ring that is
between the trunk of the tree itself or
[SPEAKER_00]: the origin, branch and the new,
the branch that you're removing and you
[SPEAKER_00]: leave the collar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The collar is what will heal that pruning
wound.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut off the collar, the tree has no
way of healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have access to the cells in
there that are going to heal the wounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you correctly do a thinning out cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a thinning out cut could also be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm holding my arm to the side
horizontally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I have a branch growing off of this
big arm-like branch, and I can do a
[SPEAKER_00]: thinning out cut, removing that little
side branch to its branch of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a thinning out cut isn't just to the
trunk of the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is to the branch of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heading back is shortening, thinning out,
removing the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there an easy way to explain when
to do which one depends on the tree?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's science there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly depends on the structure
you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my book, I tell you how to create
those structures, but think of it this
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I explain this?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are thinning out, you're removing
an entire branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go back to what I talked about about
in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the winter, you've got energy in the
root system and it's going to come up into
[SPEAKER_00]: the tree and you've pruned off a branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That branch is now absent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the energy will go to other branches
and wake up those other branches and those
[SPEAKER_00]: other branches will get lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that branch will grow longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If in the winter, however, you are heading
back a branch, you're just shortening it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The energy from the root system will come
up into that branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've clipped off the head,
the top of the branch, where there are
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones called oxens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oxen hormones like to lengthen a
branch and they dominate the side buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, you guys can't, you can't do
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to suppress you side buds and
I'm going to just get longer and longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you head back and remove those oxens,
it wakes up all the buds along that
[SPEAKER_00]: branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens is heading back cuts make
your branch have lots of side branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can make your tree kind of shrubby
and it can kind of ruin air circulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a pro and con.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you want to do that with a young
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heading back cuts will allow those
branches to thicken up and get stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've got this big old apple tree,
for instance, no air circulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a mess of branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you head back all those branches,
you're going to have even worse air
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation because you're waking up all
the buds and all those messy branches
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to have a million more
messy branches inside the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if with this big old apple tree with a
million branches, you go in and
[SPEAKER_00]: strategically cut out one or two,
we call them scaffold branches,
[SPEAKER_00]: a main branch that has a lot of side
branches on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one cut can remove the main branch,
a bunch of side branches that is
[SPEAKER_00]: cluttering the middle of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just opened it up to air
circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But saying that with an old tree,
a big old, any established tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: you never want to cut out more than 25% of
the living canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have a big old apple tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have a plan to start anew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to give it a structure with
better air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're going to do that in four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each year, you strategically make a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll probably do that with summer
pruning because you want a slow growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in four years time, you have
almost a new tree, but that will produce
[SPEAKER_00]: better quality fruit because it's not
wasting its energy making more branches
[SPEAKER_00]: and supporting the existing branches that
it has.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for breaking down the science on
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do have a lot of indoor growers
that tune into this podcast and they like
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow in small spaces and a lot are
growing in containers as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any advice for applying
pruning techniques to those folks that are
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors in containers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, containers can work for citrus,
which, you know, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would do root pruning to help keep
the citrus, whatever it is, lemon tree
[SPEAKER_00]: small.
[SPEAKER_00]: With things like apple trees, there are
apple tree root stocks that are
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate for pots, but you think about,
I just, they won't live a long time and
[SPEAKER_00]: they won't produce a big harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apple trees or cherry trees or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's my suggestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it, but find some friends and make a
community orchard in the local churchyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so fun to grow fruit trees,
to share the harvest, to work together,
[SPEAKER_00]: to build community, to have this
sustainable source of local fruit is so
[SPEAKER_00]: fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the people in my community
orchard, they live in apartment buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like their awesome fun where you
can actually look outside your four walls
[SPEAKER_00]: and have space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow it in our local park, but there's
got to be somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, it takes organizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first book, Growing Urban Orchards,
I talk all about starting a community
[SPEAKER_00]: orchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn everything that's involved,
including how to care for the tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: trees, but do it, especially now with the
world going in the direction that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going in, we need to have sustainable ways
to grow all sorts of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fruit trees, you give them a little
bit of love and they return the favor in
[SPEAKER_00]: abundance with like harvests for years to
come.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a commitment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a commitment than a zucchini
plant that you plant this year in and grow
[SPEAKER_00]: out at the end of the season in compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is commitment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I mentioned to you before,
I've planted five different trees actually
[SPEAKER_01]: recently, and I'm looking to plant four
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really excited to get this growing
season going and get to a harvest because
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to do that sharing with
friends and family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you mentioned, it's just the
rewarding feeling inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have that feeling when I share my
medicinal plants and my vegetables and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that, but fruit trees,
some of these things are going to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest way beyond what I can just
consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being able to share with friends,
families, even neighbors, I've been having
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple neighbors that have been in
contact with, so I think it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really rewarding to do the sharing
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am just, I have goosebumps because one
of the most beautiful parts of having the
[SPEAKER_00]: community orchard is the cherry harvest
day, which is early in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are all so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a list of community members.
[SPEAKER_00]: People come and they bring their children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at first it was not a good experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were people who were coming with
their own bags, elbowing out everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: else, stuffing stuff in a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't feel right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of our members said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have bowls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has to harvest into bowls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end, we may, you know,
we have an hour long harvesting session.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end, we weigh what we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know we have a record of how much
the tree produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everybody gets an equal share of
the harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just scoop it up into paper bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: It teaches the kids about sharing and the
adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the most beautiful community in a
society where we're all so isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is such a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fruit trees bring so much joy and it's not
just the harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also the collaboration with the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not, there's nothing like this
relationship you have with this living
[SPEAKER_00]: organism that will live as long as we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it becomes your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one has its own character.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really hope that you do get those
experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: One piece of advice that I heard from
somebody and I love this advice is think
[SPEAKER_00]: carefully how many trees you're going to
plant and make sure that you know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: care for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what the commitment is and
don't plant more than what you can care
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this person sharing planted hundreds of
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had the space, but he, you know,
maybe he's only able to do the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays on 80%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so 20% won't get protected and they're
going to have disease and that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my training stuff and most of my books
talk about choosing disease resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: trees, how to choose the trees that will
work together, what's involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so you know in advance, it is not a
full-time job, but what you have to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one more piece of advice I'd like to
add in if I can is choosing the right
[SPEAKER_01]: zone, stuff that will grow in your zone,
knowing your zone and choosing the stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that's in the right zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to do my research and figure out
what's going to grow here because I'm in a
[SPEAKER_01]: very dry, hot climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of things that will not
grow here, no matter what you try to do to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, choosing plants that are good for
your climate is super, super important
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically, you know, if you're growing
outdoors, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday, I just did an interview with
somebody in Mississippi Larry Stevenson
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's very damp, it's very hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, you can go to the garden
center and buy a red delicious apple tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tree, wrong zone, not enough chill
hours, but they'll sell it to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's up to us to do the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest decision you will make that
will affect the success of growing your
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit tree is choosing the right tree in
the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when I teach the workshop on
that topic, it takes me a couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take people through cross pollination
and this and that it's actually really
[SPEAKER_00]: fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like putting together a puzzle,
but you got to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you do, you're not going to have,
you're just taking 80% of the problems
[SPEAKER_00]: that you would have had and you're getting
rid of them, making your life so much more
[SPEAKER_00]: fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much more fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to shift over and talk about after
you prune things that you can apply to the
climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some natural ways to cut in order
to prevent disease?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any natural organic treatments
that you can do in that case?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the old days, when you made a pruning
cut, people used to paint it with tar and
[SPEAKER_00]: all sorts of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then researchers started to figure out
that, wait a minute, the tree is designed
[SPEAKER_00]: to heal itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like our, you know, you cut your
finger, it will heal itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you cut your finger and then paint
tar in the cut, you're actually going to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent the finger from healing and you'll
probably infect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take that idea, throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing that we have done in the
past is if my trees will have,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, canker, which is sometimes it's
disease, it's oozing goop coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the trunk or the branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, usually you can cut off
a whole branch and just get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was on the trunk of our plum tree
and we had to sort of carve it out with a
[SPEAKER_00]: box cutter, actually made a circle around
where the canker was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a sheet on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we collected all the bits of infected
tissue on the sheet so we could take it
[SPEAKER_00]: away, not leave it in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think we just sprayed with
garden sulfur, just a little bit just to,
[SPEAKER_00]: if there was any pathogen left or if it's
a kind of open wound, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most pruning cuts, you do not have to
protect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there are various products out
there and I've seen various videos of
[SPEAKER_01]: people putting things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what it's called,
like this white it looks like white paint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's not white paint, but it's some
product, but it's good to hear that you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have to apply any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trees have evolved to do this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, trees have evolved also to produce
fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you have a fruit tree,
it's a root stock, one tree with a grafted
[SPEAKER_00]: on usually grafted on scion wood,
which is another tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason that we kind of need to work
with the trees is we're cultivating it for
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit production.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the importance and for health.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the scion wood is like any tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's evolved to heal itself as long as you
make that correct pruning cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about the thinning out cuts
will be just past the collar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heading back cut, you need to cut just
about a quarter of an inch past a healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bud has to be pointing in the
right direction and whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is if you leave too much of
a stub past a bud, the stub will die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that could be an entry point for
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to just know how to make your
correct cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That brings me into mistakes that are
often made.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody were to over prune,
for example, or if there was a young tree
[SPEAKER_01]: where they made a mistake and there was a
structural issue that happened,
[SPEAKER_01]: what would be your general recommendation
for fixing those things?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, love yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly I have made many mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done many of them and I have stressed
about many of the pruning cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't anymore because I see what trees
do, at least the trees that I work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second of all, over the years,
yes, you will make mistakes and you will
[SPEAKER_00]: learn from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often what happens if people over prune,
they get too much leafy growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: water sprouts, which are these weird
looking, ugly upward branches that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: produce fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In each situation, you just need to learn
the science and learn from your mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, if you over pruned,
you will learn, oh, why did I prune and my
[SPEAKER_00]: tree got bigger with a bunch of weird
sprouts going upwards and that wasn't my
[SPEAKER_00]: goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to learn the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to understand why that
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just cut off all those sprouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just grow back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think when should I cut off the
sprouts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in the winter because we keep talking
about that cycle of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the summer, you can do it, but not all
of them because the tree, you over pruned,
[SPEAKER_00]: the tree panicked and says, I don't have
enough leaves to make energy for myself
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This person, this lady cut off too many of
my branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have enough leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I better form a lot of water sprouts that
go straight up to the sky to make more
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves so I can feed myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just trying to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really learn the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you understand the science,
the tree is just communicating with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just listen and then do something
different next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every tree is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some trees just like to produce water
sprouts, even if you prune them perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other ones just don't, like some pear
trees just don't even need a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: pruning at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has their own character.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it ever make sense to skip pruning a
year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Say you over prune something and then you
go through the growing season,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get some growth that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it make sense to skip pruning that
winter and just seeing what the next year
[SPEAKER_01]: growth would look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost never.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would not correct the pruning in the
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you over pruned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't correct it that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I see what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you totally over pruned in the winter,
what would happen is you'd have a bushy,
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy looking tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, over the growing season,
whoops, I made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to have to very slowly start
reducing the number at the right time of
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of those branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So leaving it for a year would just be a
mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of every year is your opportunity
to reduce by 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over pruning, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you ever skip a year to prune?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's a missed opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you create the structure for your
tree, it's called formative pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first, let's say three years to five
years of your tree, you're creating the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, there's minimal pruning and,
but you have to do it, but it's not a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not even as fun because
creating the shape is the funnest part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love pruning and we don't have enough
pruning to do these days because our trees
[SPEAKER_00]: have such a nice shape to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate your insight there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate your insight for this whole
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've definitely learned a handful of
things and I know that my audience has
[SPEAKER_01]: learned some things as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much for coming out of the
podcast today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell the listeners how they can
find you and is there anything you have
[SPEAKER_01]: upcoming in the future that you want to
talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can find me at orchardpeople.com
and there I have articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a monthly podcast and radio show
and I have some videos there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the Orchard People YouTube channel,
which also has tons of videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my podcast is in video format now
with lots of pictures and you learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time it's like a lesson in some
wonderful aspect of fruit tree care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, I would love to plug my new
book called Fruit Tree Pruning,
[SPEAKER_00]: The Science and Art of Cultivating Healthy
Fruit Trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys enjoyed this information,
that book is just going to teach you
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took everything in here in my head and
put it in the most digestible format
[SPEAKER_00]: because I really want to empower people to
not have to rely on chemicals to have
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy and productive fruit trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have other books as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I do online courses at
Orchard people.com that you may be
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for having me on this
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a lot of fun and it's been a
blessing to meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, definitely have a link to Susan's
YouTube channel down in the description
[SPEAKER_01]: section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd love to know in the comments
section, what way do you prune your trees?
