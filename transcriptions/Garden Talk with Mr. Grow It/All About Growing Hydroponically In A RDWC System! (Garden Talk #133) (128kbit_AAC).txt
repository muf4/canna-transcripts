[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: For you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk Podcast, this episode
number 133.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Cory from
Inside Hydro.

subscribers, and his channel revolves
[SPEAKER_00]: around hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: More specifically, RDWC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're going to get into in
today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks about what RDWC is, pros,
cons, equipment setup, how he grows plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in his system, and so much more.

[SPEAKER_00]: And today I'm joined with Corey from
Inside Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming onto the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm familiar with your work, fellow
YouTuber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you got some really good content
in regards to hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to talk all about
hydroponics, in particular our DWC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was actually a request from
Kamzee.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a Patreon supporter of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know he's in a DWC system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure he's recirculating as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all the Patreons,
really everyone that supports Patreon.com
[SPEAKER_00]: slash Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% of what is supported on there goes
right back towards the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just want to give a big thank you to
all the supporters out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get too deep into the
conversation of hydroponics, can you tell
[SPEAKER_00]: us a little bit about yourself and how you
got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my name is Corey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run the channel Inside Hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been growing for probably a little
bit more than eight years now,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started when I was 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: So luckily, Massachusetts was one of the
first legalized states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we kind of knew that was coming for a
little bit beforehand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did get started a little bit early.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I started, I actually knew
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I had no experience with any kind
of plan at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am a pretty fast learner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I can pick things up pretty
quickly, I like to believe, at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just did a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually knew right away that DWC was
the way I wanted to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I started with,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just ran a bunch of single buckets
for the first couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I built off of that little bit of
knowledge or experience that I was gaining
[SPEAKER_01]: every grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually, I understood what I was
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since then, I've just made small
tweaks that ultimately result in a better
[SPEAKER_01]: run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've actually been growing on YouTube
for seven years now across a few different
[SPEAKER_01]: channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, this is the third one,
hopefully the last one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are starting to lighten up a little
bit, I hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just crossing my fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I hate the fact that YouTube does
that, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take down channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a channel taken down before,
as well as 75,000 subscribers wiped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that feeling of just knowing that you
have to start over completely and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you've built over those years
is gone is just one of the worst feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't wish that upon anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sorry to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm glad to see that your new channel
here is being built up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got coming up on 40,000
subscribers, 37,000 subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So congratulations on your success so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have some really, really great videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything revolves around RDWC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us what does RDWC stand for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you explain the basic concept
behind this hydroponic system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So DWC stands for deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then RDWC stands for recirculating
deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, the only difference between the
two is that in RDWC, all of the buckets
[SPEAKER_01]: are connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And using the same nutrient solution,
which is recirculating between each pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, in an RDWC system,
if we say it's six plants, you'll have
[SPEAKER_01]: seven buckets, six of them being occupied
by plants, and then one being your control
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the buckets are connected with
piping and sharing the same nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only is the water circulating
through all of the buckets, but it's being
[SPEAKER_01]: aerated as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each plant has a net pot where the
plant sits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through that pot, the roots grow down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are completely submerged in the
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty straightforward description there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the pros and cons to
growing in an RDWC system?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say I might be a little bit biased
for this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right off the top, the first thing
that comes to mind is rate of growth for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these plants grow extremely fast
and big in an RDWC system, which can shave
[SPEAKER_01]: off weeks of veg time, which can also save
you some money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, in RDWC, you're generally going to
be using 50% less nutrients throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: run, just because the roots are sitting
directly in the solution at all time,
[SPEAKER_01]: making it much easier for them to absorb.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means you can get away with a lot
lower PPMs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also being able to get a zero PPM flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's possible in some other
systems, but that's really important for
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another pro would be maintenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, once you have the system set up
and running, you can just keep reusing it
[SPEAKER_01]: indefinitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some cons would be setup costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not frugal, it can get pretty
expensive to buy an RDWC or build an RDWC
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like with any hydroponics,
you have moving parts, which also always
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves room for failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually have my system set up in a
way that is kind of fail proof,
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to believe, at least for the
electrical components that are involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then kind of getting deeper into how
the system works.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the main components of an RDWC
system and how do they work together?
[SPEAKER_00]: To grow the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main components would be first your
circulation pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what keeps the water
circulating throughout each bucket and
[SPEAKER_01]: ensures the solution is always mixed and
moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stagnant water is never really a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also your air pump, which keeps
the water oxygenated and makes it livable
[SPEAKER_01]: basically for your roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roots need enough oxygen for growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that also helps prevent root rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: With those two things, you can pretty much
make a system out of anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any container pretty much works.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as it's opaque.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all you really need after that is a
net pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also have a reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the tubing connects to a bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically in RDWC, it's multiple
buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then within the buckets, you have what
you talked about the pump and then the air
[SPEAKER_00]: stones and stuff like that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Each bucket has its own air stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll have one circulation pump
that sits inside the control bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you'll have a return line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the water comes from the control
bucket, goes through all of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: buckets, and then it comes back through
the return line back to the control
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how it makes its circuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you running the pump and the air
stones 24-7?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, all times 24-7.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then is there any general
recommendations for how many air stones to
[SPEAKER_00]: put in each bucket?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's some concerns about a lack
of aeration, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can get into some of the problems
with solutions later on, but one of them
[SPEAKER_00]: is not having enough of that aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many stones do you typically put in
each container?
[SPEAKER_01]: I generally I'll use one air stone per
bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do use the larger ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like a soda can type of shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for a general rule of thumb,
as long as your entire surface of water is
[SPEAKER_01]: bubbling, then you should be in a pretty
good spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you happen to know wattage that it
pulls from the wall, the pump and the air
[SPEAKER_00]: stones and all that stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's about one liter per gallon
that you want your pump to put out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the system's 50 gallons,
it needs to be putting out at least 50
[SPEAKER_01]: liters per hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can always go higher than that
when it comes to the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't really add too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as power consumption,
not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, power consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually not sure the wattage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not really sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're decently low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say around 50 watts,
but I could be mistaken there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's different pump sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about the pump that's within the
main part that was in the reservoir is
[SPEAKER_00]: where that main pump is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally put mine in the control
reservoir just to prevent any leaks
[SPEAKER_01]: because if something did go wrong,
if you had the pump in the return line,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is somewhere else, you can also put
it, then there would be a chance of things
[SPEAKER_01]: leaking onto the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: I choose to not even have to worry about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do place mine inside the control
bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anything did go wrong, it's just
going to leak inside the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really not going to leak at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you've built your own system
there and it can be a lot cheaper to build
[SPEAKER_00]: your own versus buy one of these pre-made
ones, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the average cost to build your
own system versus buying a pre-made one?
[SPEAKER_01]: So my current system, I've been growing in
for about almost three years now,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was $600 to build.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same system from current culture will
be closer to like $2,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: And granted, they do have a few more
features.
[SPEAKER_01]: And stuff like that, but it's nothing that
you can't live without.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge, huge price difference there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at the current culture ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a very popular brand and man,
they've got some big systems there.
[SPEAKER_00]: $1,600 over $2,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it can be very costly there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are really nice though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will give them that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get a little bit deeper into the
system that you've built.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you break it down for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what is the bucket size?
[SPEAKER_00]: How big is your reservoir?
[SPEAKER_00]: What size tubing are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my current system, it's built with
eight gallon square buckets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have six plant buckets and then one
eight gallon for the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all connected with two inch
PVC piping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the one thing I will recommend is using
the current culture bulkheads for your
[SPEAKER_01]: piping and connections from bucket to
bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the best bulkheads I've ever
used and they are pretty expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will probably be the biggest cost of
the entire build.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you're going to plan on flowering
in the system, I wouldn't go anything less
[SPEAKER_01]: than two inch for the piping size to
reduce the risks of any clogging or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you kind of connect everything
together?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's, there's like a solution that
you kind of wipe onto the PVC and then
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of slide it in and it hardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that pretty much?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use PVC cement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a glue for PVC that kind of just
bonds the stuff together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any particular brand or anything that you
recommend there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they all pretty much the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like what you would use like
for house piping.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really just get whatever they have at
Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much anything will work as long as
it's made for PVC specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in your six buckets that are
eight gallon each on top, you mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: net pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the size of the net pot that's on
top of the buckets?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have six, six inch net pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it goes six inches down into the,
into the bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what do you put in the net pots?
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a straight Hydra and mix and then,
but well, I'll plant my seeds inside
[SPEAKER_01]: Rockwell and then I'll put the Rockwell in
and I'll cover that in Hydra and clay
[SPEAKER_01]: pebbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else could be used besides the clay
pebbles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people choose to use like a mixture
of perlite and Hydra.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can use, if you have a big enough
Rockwell cube, you can just go straight
[SPEAKER_01]: Rockwell if you did choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I find Hydra and just on its own,
it works great for drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has good airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't really find that feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to add anything else to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at what point of the plant's life
do you put it in the RDWC system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned that you started
Rockwell, how long you let that plant grow
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Rockwell until you're actually
putting it into your system?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can really put it in at any stage,
but normally if I have a set number of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and I know I'm going to be using
all of them, I'll put them in the RDWC as
[SPEAKER_01]: soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as they have a tap root coming out
of the Rockwell, just so that they can get
[SPEAKER_01]: acclimated to the system, the roots can
start growing through the net pot that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to actually be in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the earlier the better really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then since the roots aren't actually
reaching the water at that point,
[SPEAKER_00]: are you doing some sort of top feeding
until the plant establishes roots in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll definitely top feed for the first
couple of weeks, at least until the first
[SPEAKER_01]: roots hit the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to even continue top feeding for a
few weeks after that to ensure we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: strong base of roots coming out of the net
pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then water level within the actual
buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you aim for?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the early stages, I'll always
recommend people to keep their water level
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit below the net pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you have a nice safe space of
moist air.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard for any rot to form
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you have a good root zone
forming, you really want to bring that
[SPEAKER_01]: water level all the way up to the bottom
of that net pot just till that there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: water that I mean, there's no roots that
are exposed to air and not intaking
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would happen in that case?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if somebody would have that water
level really low?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just less of the root mass that can
absorb and help the plant out since it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just sitting out in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really doing much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what if you have too much water in
there that you bring the waters really all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way into the net pots?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you definitely want to leave a little
bit of room so that the plant can breathe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want it to be oversaturated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the rock wall is, you want the rock
wall to actually be pretty dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you don't want there to be any
moisture until that water level under the
[SPEAKER_01]: net pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting into nutrients next, what do you
use for nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you target a specific EC or PPM for
the different stages of growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I do use I'll use I use synthetic
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was running floor flex for the past
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But recently, I've switched to drip hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something new that I'm kind of
trying out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my PPM will differ from grow to grow
just depending on strain and how the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are intaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the nice things about RDWC
is you can see that pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally speaking for veg,
I'll start around a point three,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll work my way up to a point nine,
1.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once we get into flower,
I'll give them an initial boost to around
[SPEAKER_01]: a 1.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll work my way up to a 1.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I begin tapering back down after
week five to six, eventually to zero PPM
[SPEAKER_01]: flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do you monitor the pH as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, what do you aim for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely, I do monitor my pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really crucial for anyone to
do the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, I aim for a 5.8.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get super scientific about it and
change it depending on the growth stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that there's anything wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I run a little bit lighter approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let my P I'll pH my mixes to 5.8.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll let it ride until it's a mid
six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I do adjust anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, I'm aiming for the pH to stay
pretty steady throughout the week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have to adjust it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another thing to mention in
regards to water is the water temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super important when growing
hydroponically.
[SPEAKER_00]: What water temperature do you aim for?
[SPEAKER_01]: So my water temperature usually sits
around 73 to 77, which really isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily in the ideal range at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do choose to not run a chiller in my
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the water temps kind of mimic the room
temperatures a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be the ideal water temperature?
[SPEAKER_01]: So ideally, you want the water temperature
to be around 68 degrees because higher
[SPEAKER_01]: temps do lead to less dissolved oxygen in
the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can lead to root rot pathogens
forming in your root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as long as you are running a
beneficial bacteria and the temperatures
[SPEAKER_01]: don't rise over 80, you're in a pretty
good spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's one of the concerns for me
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about to start for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a DWC bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's always been the water temperature
has been a concern because I live in the
[SPEAKER_00]: desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's naturally, you know, my water temp
could easily reach 80, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if not in the high 70s, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So high 70s, you're saying is achievable
as long as you're treating the water you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, high 70s is definitely achievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: My water is at 77 degrees, a lot more than
I would like it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the addition of the beneficial
bacteria, it really does a great job of
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping everything healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the temperature, as long as you're
adding it every week, the temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, it's not the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it that you're adding in for the
beneficial bacteria?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was running HydroGuard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recently switched to Impello Bio,
they have something called Continium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that we're trying out
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now each week, the nutrient requirements
are going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's a good general practice to
clean out the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often are you changing out the
reservoir?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you have any cleaning tips?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do weekly water changes throughout
the entire growth cycle, for the most
[SPEAKER_01]: part, sometimes early on when the plants
are really young, I'll let them run in the
[SPEAKER_01]: same res for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's pretty much max, the solution
will start to degrade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's best to just keep everything fresh
weekly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, I'm only cleaning the system
between runs, I'll use a descaler to get
[SPEAKER_01]: rid of any of the salt buildup,
anything that may be stuck in the piping,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that can't be done while we are
growing, because that will kill the
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial bacteria that we're trying to
keep alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to the chiller for a minute,
I know you don't run one, but there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: folks in the audience that are wondering,
what is a chiller?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain what a chiller is?
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of everything else about it,
like how much a chiller costs,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much it will actually lower the
temperature of the water, and so on and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a water chiller is basically an AC for
the water, a piece of equipment you can
[SPEAKER_01]: run your water through to get it down to
your desired temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want it at 68 degrees,
you could set that on the chiller and it
[SPEAKER_01]: would achieve that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really have a reason as to why I
don't run a chiller anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first, it was just a cost thing,
because they are $300 to $400,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can be even more expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to keep my electricity
down as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty much why I don't run one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that I've been successful for so
long without one, I feel like I don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know a lot of people have been
complaining about the power consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: being just so expensive to run those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was another thing that kind of
deterred me from doing hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I thought that I would need a
water chiller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that additional expense right now,
I don't really want to spend the money on
[SPEAKER_00]: a water chiller.
[SPEAKER_00]: But learning what I learned today about
how I can potentially run a higher water
[SPEAKER_00]: temp in the high 70s, for example,
and just have the beneficial bacteria in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably a route that I'm going to
try out for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that a lot of that belief actually
comes from like with the HPS lighting that
[SPEAKER_01]: it just threw off so much heat that it was
nearly impossible to keep the water
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature in check, like no matter what
you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that everyone's using LEDs,
they're not putting off as much heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the beneficial bacteria,
it's definitely possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you talked about the different PPM or
EC that you aim for for the different
[SPEAKER_00]: stages of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also hinted towards the beginning
of the episode that you flush your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the end of the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you go about doing that end of
cycle flush?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do flush all my runs for a minimum of
three days, sometimes a week or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: In RDWC, you really only need about three
days of flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will try to time my harvest on the
trichome stages more than anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the flush is a little bit too early
and the trichomes aren't quite where I
[SPEAKER_01]: want them to be, I'll extend the flush for
a few more days.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't like going over seven days
because you can tell the plants really
[SPEAKER_01]: start to suffer after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, the only important part of my
flush is that I'm using the zero PPM RO
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're making sure to not only refill
and empty the system once, but multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: times to make sure we're getting every
last bit of anything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are lots of problems that can
occur in recirculating deep articulture or
[SPEAKER_00]: any really hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of those common problems
that growers may encounter when either
[SPEAKER_00]: setting up or growing in an RDWC system?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to setting up a system,
one of the biggest concerns is making sure
[SPEAKER_01]: you have a circulation pump for the right
size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that's too big will actually
result in you just overflowing naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's always good to test that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure your water level is even
throughout on all the buckets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the other most important thing is
your air pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to make sure you have a big
enough air pump that's putting out enough
[SPEAKER_01]: air so that your roots zones don't
suffocate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you have those two things down,
pretty much you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of problems that I'm
aware of that I figure I'd fire off and
[SPEAKER_00]: see if you had any solutions to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them would be the struggle to have
different cultivars in the same system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got one nutrient mix that's being
fed to all different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally speaking, different
cultivars are going to update nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you come across problems where it's
like some plants are deficient while some
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are toxic or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually, that's pretty common.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really try to run the same strain
throughout the entire system if I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that gets a little bit boring
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have had instances where I have one
strain that's just completely toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting way too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I have five other ones that are
doing well, then I'm going to worry about
[SPEAKER_01]: those more than just the one that is off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to favor the masses, I guess,
to make up for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, there's not much you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the downsides of sharing the
same solution for all plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to run the same
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to the point where it's like
same strain as in same cut or same strain
[SPEAKER_00]: as in like it can be from seed,
just the same strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, from seed, just the same strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be the cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even the phenols are going to
differ a little bit, but it's not big
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to where you're going to notice a
huge one is going to be deficient where
[SPEAKER_01]: the other one isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really won't have that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another problem that is pretty common and
we already kind of touched upon it,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is maintaining the water temp,
keeping that water temp lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, chiller was one solution,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some hacks out there that
you could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know some people do the frozen
water bottles in order to kind of lower
[SPEAKER_00]: the temp in the reservoir in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any other hacks like that to
lower the water temp that you know of?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess really the only thing that you can
do that's going to really control it is
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping your room temperatures down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you control your room to seventy
five degrees, the water is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: seventy three to seventy seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go down even lower, say seventy
degrees, you know, you're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty close to that ideal range.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing I would say about adding the
ice things to the buckets is just be
[SPEAKER_01]: careful that if that is a plant,
if that's a plant bucket and the ice is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually touching the roots, that can be a
little bit dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can do that in like your control
res, but I wouldn't add ice to like
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that has a root zone in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another problem that may actually may not
be a big problem is algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So algae can kind of show up, particularly
on you might have seen on the clay
[SPEAKER_00]: pebbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know rock wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who do only rock wall grows have
algae on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, actually on a side note,
I need to get somebody on the podcast who
[SPEAKER_00]: grows in rock wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody has any suggestions,
put it down in the comments section below
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But algae do you worry about that at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, like what do you do about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the system, you're not going to
really have much algae because you have
[SPEAKER_01]: the beneficial bacteria in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not it's not going to really be
growing on the inside of the bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one place you may get it is on top of
that rock wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would really only happen is if
you're top feeding and then it's staying
[SPEAKER_01]: damp on there for a little bit too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after those first couple of weeks,
you really aren't top feeding anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's not much water getting up on
top or even on that hydron at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're really not going to have much of
an algae problem or at least you
[SPEAKER_01]: shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another common problem that people face,
particularly when they're building their
[SPEAKER_00]: own systems is leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have any kind of best practices
for how to handle leaks?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, do you recommend that folks put
together the system and then kind of check
[SPEAKER_00]: for leaks initially or do they check for
leaks frequently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how do you go about leaks?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I actually mentioned that
thing about the current culture bulkheads,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's going to give you the best
chance of not running into a leak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's worth spending a little bit extra
on those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I would definitely say once you
have the system built, fill it up with
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that the pumps are running
evenly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you're not going to overflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most importantly, make sure that you
are not leaking, because if you start
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and you run a leak, it's going to
be really, really hard to plug it or fill
[SPEAKER_01]: it from the outside while there's water in
the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can do stuff like that,
but you're going to have to empty
[SPEAKER_01]: everything out, you know, try to fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're kind of just crossing your
fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's best to make sure that the system
is solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is perfect before you put
plants in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't rush that part at all,
because there is a lot of water that is
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially can spill.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about equipment was wondering what
pH meter do you use?
[SPEAKER_01]: What pH meter?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use I actually just got a new setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called it's from Pulse and it's a pH
and a PPM monitor that is always in my res
[SPEAKER_01]: and it connects to my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that has actually made things really,
really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see like not only what the pH and
PPM is currently, but what it's done like
[SPEAKER_01]: over however long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really nice to see things if
they're steady, see if things are
[SPEAKER_01]: dropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives you a ton of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this also show water temperature on
there as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shows you water temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think eventually they're even
going to be adding something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: measuring the aeration in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to be great as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some really good advancements with
Pulse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they also have like moisture meters
that you can put in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's definitely a company that
is innovative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've actually been working with them
for a few years and they've been they've
[SPEAKER_01]: been great all the way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really enjoy their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of folks that are
beginners and they're just starting out
[SPEAKER_00]: growing with hydroponics, whether it be a
DWC system and our DWC system,
[SPEAKER_00]: narrowing it down to our DWC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your bread and butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice do you have for beginners who
are really just getting started using this
[SPEAKER_00]: system?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you start out, you really have two
options.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I already told you guys to run the
beneficial bacteria, but your other option
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be running a sterile res,
which I would definitely recommend not
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a much tougher time to
keep things sterile, whereas if you add
[SPEAKER_01]: the beneficial bacteria, it's kind of just
a set and forget as long as you keep
[SPEAKER_01]: adding it weekly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something to definitely maybe
steer away from.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wanted to, I would say try it out
later on, but it's pretty difficult to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep a sterile system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know we are narrowing it down to our
DWC, but I tend to recommend for people to
[SPEAKER_01]: do start out with a single bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you can really focus on one
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a good understanding of DWC,
how everything works, and then expanding
[SPEAKER_01]: on that plant count is really nothing more
than what you've already done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some good tips there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have flown through this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been super quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any more questions for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it's because I am kind of just
getting started with hydroponics myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing soil, cocoa,
for the entire time I've been growing
[SPEAKER_00]: since 2010, 14 years now, which is hard to
imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'm just going to be getting
into hydroponics here this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything else we need to know
about our DWC that we didn't cover in this
[SPEAKER_00]: talk?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think we did a pretty good job of
getting through just about everything you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to know to actually successfully grow
in our DWC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell the listeners how they can
find you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can find me on YouTube at Inside
Hydro Grow, Instagram, Inside Hydro with
[SPEAKER_01]: two O's.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the usernames are slightly
different because we've lost so many
[SPEAKER_01]: accounts, but I do have a website
insidehydro.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pretty much link to anything off
of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are mid run here with this V-Grow
box.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a harvest coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you are looking to get into
our DWC, it's the perfect time because
[SPEAKER_01]: we're doing some room system upgrades and
we're starting a brand new run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have that coming up within the next
couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll definitely have a link to Corey's
YouTube channel down in the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below so you can
easily get to his channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out his vids.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got some really good content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very entertaining, informative,
straight to the point, just like this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of you guys will as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very insightful for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure it's been insightful for some
of my audience as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch you in the next video.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
