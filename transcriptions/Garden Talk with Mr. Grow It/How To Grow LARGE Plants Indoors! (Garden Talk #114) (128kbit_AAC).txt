[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: For you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk podcast, this episode
number 114.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Sly,
aka Loco.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been gardening for six years,
and he grows indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has experience growing with synthetic
as well as organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one main focus for him is growing
large plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're going to get into
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: He breaks it down for us, his style of
growing large plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go over lighting, environment
conditions, plant nutrition, plant
[SPEAKER_00]: training, and so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see highlights of these
Garden Talk podcast episodes, search
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden Talk clips on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you'll find short, bite-sized clips
of these episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a gardening channel,
which has over 130 videos of plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link that channel down in the YouTube
description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my goals for this podcast is to
bring free information about gardening to
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode, who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to AAC Infinity for sponsoring this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their clip-on oscillating fan is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using their 6-inch version,
but they also have a 9-inch version.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to clip on the side of my grow
tent and has 10 different speeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes it easy to control air
circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have a non-oscillating version of
this clip-on fan as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also connects to their Smart Controller
69, so you can control the fans and other
[SPEAKER_00]: AAC Infinity equipment through their app
from your smartphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The discount code MRGROIT15 works on both
Amazon and their website, acinfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stash Blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using Stash Blend for over a
year now, and it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I really like is
that it saves me money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole bunch of different inputs in
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I no longer have to go out there and
buy a silica bottle, then a separate
[SPEAKER_00]: seaweed bottle, beneficial bacteria,
then a separate one for mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that plus more is in this one
blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to stashblend.com to learn more about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also have a link down in the YouTube
description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Sly, AKA Loco.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody loves my horn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always do that on your Instagram show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I know you through Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually had me on your show before
Kana Convos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually going to be on there again
soon in March sometime, if I remember
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly, or maybe it's February.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on my calendar, but you have some
great content on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I mostly know you from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know before we started recording,
you said you have a YouTube as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, how about you just start off by
just telling us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my name is Sly, AKA Loco,
as everybody should know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been growing about six years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started with a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: A friend actually came by and he gave me a
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I decided that I wanted to grow that
plant out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I went outside and I grew it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, the way I got started was kind
of a little crazy too, because for those
[SPEAKER_01]: who don't know, I had gotten sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a big drug user and alcoholic a long
time ago in my former life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had cotton swine flu,
H1N1 virus, which is kind of weird because
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody around me caught it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was in a coma for three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They flew me to Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm originally from Washington,
but they flew me over to Portland because
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the only place with the ECMO
machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I was in a coma for three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw a lot of visions and a lot of
stuff that when I came out of the coma,
[SPEAKER_01]: I left my old life behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stopped doing drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just concentrated on the plant that
we all love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ever since then, I've been just
flourishing, just loving life,
[SPEAKER_01]: going better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just been amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to hear that you recover from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty, pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't hear about people, anybody,
like I've never heard of anybody getting
[SPEAKER_00]: that and then being in a coma for three
weeks, being able to come back and the
[SPEAKER_00]: adversity you had and overcoming the other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's, that's incredible,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it took a while, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to learn how to walk again and
everything, but I did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came out the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was 400 pounds at that time too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I lost 170 pounds in like, under a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and yeah, everything ever since I
stopped drinking and just moved to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that we all love.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything has switched.
[SPEAKER_01]: My life has changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been more positive and yeah,
it's just been really good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Loving life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really glad to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're an indoor grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: What size grow space are you in and kind
of how many plants are you growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, right now I just took a little size or
I checked the size of my room and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: about 10 by 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I have two tents in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two, four by four tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also a little one, uh, two by two tent
tube that is for my clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and yeah, that's what I have in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I have a sink in there, which not a
lot of people have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of people have sinks in their
rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think I feel like it makes it a
lot easier to flush, to water,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, go about the daily stuff that
you need to do with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it so much easier, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm between grows, like if I have to
wash out grow pots, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: like doing in a bathtub, you know,
bending over and like, man, I,
[SPEAKER_00]: my back hurts after a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to sit there scrubbing and I've
been doing things outside and still you're
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of bending over and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a sink would be really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had a sink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what a lot of people tell me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always tell me that I'm very lucky to
have a sink there and that, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is too, because when I have to
take my plants into the tub, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause back in the day I would flush in the
tub for some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, because my plants were too big.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were too big to go in the sink.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to take them out to the tub and
that was a hassle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I definitely felt for people who
have to move their plants out into a tub
[SPEAKER_01]: or something like that, into a area where
they can get wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you, that would be a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really would not like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel also that if you have trellises
in your tent, um, you wouldn't be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: take the plant out and you don't do
whatever you have to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would have been another problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I typically grow smaller plants a
little bit easier to transport from the
[SPEAKER_00]: tent to a tub.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, back when I flushed and I
kind of switched over to organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not really doing flushes as much
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if ever, usually it was just with
synthetic nutrients, but, uh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mostly just grow a small plant,
sometimes medium plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You on the other hand, grow large plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're going to talk about
today really is growing large plants
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a topic that we haven't
really covered in depth before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad when we first talked about,
well, Hey, what should we talk about this
[SPEAKER_00]: time around?
[SPEAKER_00]: You had said, Hey, I grow large plants
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's base it around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get deep into your style of growing
larger plants indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first question I got for you is,
are you growing after like certain
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that are like deemed high
yielders, for example, or have like a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain morphology, like anything in the
listing description that's going to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this is going to be good for growing
the large plants indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, actually I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, um, just go with whatever genetics I
can get, whatever genetics come around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very curious, curious person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to see if I can take a plant
that is supposed to be small and see if I
[SPEAKER_01]: can make it a bigger plant, which in turn
would mean that I have to do a longer veg
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one thing that I usually do is
I will start off in like a one gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then transfer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like transferring is one of the
reasons why my plants get to so big is
[SPEAKER_01]: because I transfer a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll transfer from a one gallon to three
gallon from a three gallon to its final
[SPEAKER_01]: thing is a five gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually if I did go a little bit above a
five gallon, if I went to a seven gallon,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant would be massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time that I've done a seven gallon
plant, it's just been incredibly big all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way up to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't move, you know, the light up any
higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I just had to start training and start
bringing the branches down in turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably going a little bit too fast
there for that, but, um, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just big plants, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very big plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the longer veg time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Veg is what I do because I usually veg for
about at least minimum seven weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for the genetics, can you name off
maybe a couple different plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be at any point where you feel
like, Hey, these ones were easy to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of, you know, they grew pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew large quickly without the longer
veg time maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there anything that kind of comes to
mind that you're like, Oh, this is good
[SPEAKER_00]: for a large plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, this is one that a lot of people know
is GG four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that one is usually a big plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I also had a blue fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a massive plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have to do a long, I didn't have
to do a long veg or anything with that
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just grew big.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, also this last one that I was doing
was a triple crown.
[SPEAKER_01]: A triple crown was a big one too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't actually have to do too much to
it and a long stretch on it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I pushed the flower, it was very big.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't really go looking for any of
the big genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just come across what I come across and
then I'll just grow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what are you using for lighting?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's arguably one of the most contributing
factors to growth, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the light energy?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use them for grow lights?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the grow lights, I have a high
photon flux, HPF 4,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I'm going right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am sponsored by them also by the way,
a very good company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suggest people to go check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's a bar style LED, um, has the red
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a full spectrum light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also have the spider farmer S E
5,000 is in my other four by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I only keep those at about 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you chasing after a certain par for
those that don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have quite a few beginners that kind of
tuned into this par photosynthetic active
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of different
measurements, PPF, which is kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: total light output of a fixture PPF D,
which is kind of a spot check in basic
[SPEAKER_00]: terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you aiming for a certain PPF D?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm not actually, I don't have a par
tester or a PPF.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think it might be on the AC
controller.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, actually I don't though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just roll with it and I read the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants will kind of tell me if the
light is too intense, you know how they
[SPEAKER_01]: start to get the pastels or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's when I know to turn down the
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I basically read the plan, the read the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what about CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another thing that really can
contribute to a lot faster plant growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you run CO2 at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I do now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the past, I just let, uh, just let the
plants grow with the lights, the water,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I started adding CO2 recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have this product that's called is
the VIP plantation CO2 maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he's a guy on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: He makes a little, uh, concoction,
which I think it's just yeast and sugar or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that and water,
put six cups of water, shake it up and
[SPEAKER_01]: just hang it up in your tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gives you your plants of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does it last?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you need to like refresh it every
couple of weeks or something or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it only lasts two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he gives you a package.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get one container that's already made.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just, or that's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just add the water and mix it up and
then it'll work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it also comes with another
package for the next two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of those packages lasts two weeks
and then you've got to refresh it,
[SPEAKER_01]: take it out, wash it, add the other
packet, add some more water and then boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have about two, six, I have about
eight weeks of packaging there to use,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think that'd be perfect for a veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the total cost on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have to know how much the packages
cost and kind of how much you're spending
[SPEAKER_00]: per run?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the whole setup that it was about
$30 to have them ship it out and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was about the same price that I see
at the growth stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but his is a little bit bigger and it
lasts a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get an extra couple of weeks on there
for that $30.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I felt that that was the way that I
wanted to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've developed a reputation or rapport
with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, he looked it up a little bit
more too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now do you have a CO2 monitor where you're
kind of monitoring things and dialing in
[SPEAKER_00]: with that type of setup with CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have as much control as you
would with like a tank, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a monitor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you able to see like what it goes up
to and what the low point is and stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a monitor yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually very new to the CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have a monitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't even know what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, uh, I'm very new, very green to this
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta start doing a little bit more
research so I can figure out how,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cause I think it's in PPMs,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people go up to like, you know,
14, 1500 PPM at the max.
[SPEAKER_00]: I naturally for me, well naturally outside
it's what like 400, 450 PPM naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're indoors us exhaling and I have a
three month old daughter, she's exhaling
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two cats, they're exhaling say CO2
every time I go to my tenants at like 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always elevated a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for me, I have an exhaust and I'm
pulling air out and the fresh air that's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in is from my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I just, I don't even run CO2
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to run the mushroom bags for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did see some increase in it,
but there's some kind of inconsistencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran the TMB naturals before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, same thing where it's just kind of
up and down, up and down, no real stable
[SPEAKER_00]: result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just finding out, you know,
for me, I'm just a small home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow these small plants, just myself,
six to 12 plants max is usually what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: running in that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally don't really need to run CO2,
but I can see for the folks, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody like yourself who's looking to
grow large plants, CO2 can certainly be
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I was just curious on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one thing that I've been trying
to keep an eye on is trying to see if it
[SPEAKER_01]: really does work.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's giving my plants the more faster
grow, the bigger grow all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel that it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that they're growing faster,
bigger, which is always good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I really like a nice big plant
to go into veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I feel is that veg is the pregame
to the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the game is when you go into
flower and that that's the Superbowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to be very ready before you
put that plant into the flower stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, kind of rule of thumb is the plant
to be half the size you want generally,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're going to expect some
stretch to happen even after flipping the
[SPEAKER_00]: light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the plant to be healthy,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a lot of people won't flip to
flower unless their plant is fully
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they've seen any sorts of deficiencies
or anything, they won't flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, with auto flowers,
you're kind of SOL there because it's on a
[SPEAKER_00]: timeline, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you come across deficiency,
well, you just got to roll with the
[SPEAKER_00]: punches in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with photo periods, you kind of have
that control, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep it in veg for a little bit
longer, get it healthy again, and then be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to flip to flower from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one reason that I don't really
mess with auto flowers is because I like
[SPEAKER_01]: the control to being able to change it
into flower when I'm ready, when I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: that the plant is ready, which is kind of,
you know, kind of a little messed up to
[SPEAKER_01]: say it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's when I feel that the plant is
going to be able to give me the best buds
[SPEAKER_01]: is when I want to send it into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't want you turning on,
you know, small and then giving me little
[SPEAKER_01]: buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need big buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably why I don't mess with auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown about probably two dozen,
close to three dozen auto flowers now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I got some good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like them once in a while,
but for the most part, I do prefer having
[SPEAKER_00]: that control over the photo period,
you know, being able to keep it in veg for
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as I want so I could shape the
plant the way I want it, then be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: flip over the flower when I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just personal preference there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what about like temperature and
humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you usually aiming for for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for temps, I have been messing with
temps a little bit because I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a very experimental person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to go around and check and see,
okay, how do they work at a 72,
[SPEAKER_01]: 73 degrees, 75.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now right now I'm at 78 degrees with
about 50 to 60 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: 60% humidity, which some people would say
is kind of low because in my room,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my little room, you would think that
it'd be easier to control the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Summertime, it gets really hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wintertime, it gets really cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to either turn up the heater
more or the air conditioner, which I put a
[SPEAKER_01]: portable air conditioner in there during
the summertime because over here on the
[SPEAKER_01]: west side or on the east side of
Washington is not like the west side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: The west side, you got a more calmer
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: 70, 80 degrees is the hottest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe 90 degrees is the hottest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets a hundred and something over here
on the regular every summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over here and there's zero humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you deal with this too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause being where you're at, um,
you have to add humidity and so we'll get
[SPEAKER_01]: a humidifier, but then on the same time,
since I'm in a small little room,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I have so many plants going,
it puts the humidity through the roof.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I'd have to turn on the
dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then turn on the dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I have to, it's going to add a little
bit of heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I got to turn up the air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm constantly fighting with
temperatures in my little grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Balancing that environment easier said
than done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a, that's something when I
first started growing 14 years ago indoors
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was like, yeah, it should be easy to
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have my HPS, put the HPS in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put my plants in there right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then all of a sudden the skyrocketed with
temp with heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what the heck?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to get an exhaust,
have the exhaust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the exhaust running all times and all
of a sudden the heat is still high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, what the heck?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to add cooling and it's,
it's a balancing act for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your heater and humidifier and all that
stuff that's in your lung room,
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume, which is the room that your grow
tents are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you controlling that air?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that way any air coming into the
tents are of the proper RH and
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's what that's the way I try to
keep it to where the outside temps are
[SPEAKER_01]: better or, you know, a little bit more
down than the inset tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do have, I have the AC infinity
controller on the tent on one of my AC
[SPEAKER_01]: infinity tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that controller does tell me,
you know, the temps, the humidity and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything in one of them, but the other
tent, I don't have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just freestyling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of assume that it's in the
right, same thing as the other tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I mean, it's the same environment,
but you know, you really want to be on top
[SPEAKER_01]: of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just been slacking on that veg tent
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned 78 degrees Fahrenheit and
50 to 60% RH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that for the vegetation stage or the
flowering stage or both?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, for both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're running that the whole way
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I would like, I would like my,
uh, my, my humidity go a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I like that point in flower because
I'm very, uh, paranoid about getting mold
[SPEAKER_01]: and getting, you know, just mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very paranoid about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I try to keep the humidity very
low in the room because I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: build up mold behind the walls,
which is possibility in growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: which some people need to know out there
is if you are growing into a, if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in a complex or apartment complex
or something, that's what they are worried
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're worried about you getting the
humidity so high and mold growing behind
[SPEAKER_01]: the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody wants that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure that your humidity is low in
your room, but in their tent, in your
[SPEAKER_01]: tent, you want high humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard of like grow operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have converted their entire house
and the way they got busted is they see
[SPEAKER_00]: the condensation on the windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like neighbors and stuff would see the
condensation build up and that's too high
[SPEAKER_00]: of humidity right in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that stuff can definitely cause
mold to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now me, I often get people commenting on
my videos cause when they see my setup,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I have it in, I have a nine by 12
bedroom and have a couple of tents in
[SPEAKER_00]: there right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a two by four, I've had other size
tents in there in the past, but my exhaust
[SPEAKER_00]: is coming from the tent up into my attic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have ventilation into the attic as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes completely out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've had so many people like,
Hey, you shouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that'll mold up your, your attic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Valid point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very valid point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just dumping high humidity in
there, depending on, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the temperatures and stuff like that,
it could actually cause mold to happen on
[SPEAKER_00]: your roof there on the inside panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen pictures of that and it looks
like just a complete nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in a very dry climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say that in every single
episode, every single one of my main
[SPEAKER_00]: channel videos, every single one of my
podcast episodes, I live in a dry climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if I dump stuff up there,
it's usually not high enough to cause
[SPEAKER_00]: mold, but those living in a high humidity
area, they're dumping stuff into their
[SPEAKER_00]: attic, their high likelihood of mold
happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from my understanding that can be
very, very costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So forget I mentioned that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it only takes one spore guys,
one spore of mold and it will just blow up
[SPEAKER_01]: and it'll just reproduce and reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes in the worst case scenario,
you don't know that it's happening and you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know that it's happening until you
start getting sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody please be on top of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that you're not getting mold in
places that you can't see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about your grill room,
talked about lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about environment conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what else impacts the size of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't talk about soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in soil, cocoa, hydro?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in soil, what's in your mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am using a happy frog soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just recently switched to organic
amendments so that I could build my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm using the same soil instead of
cause I used to just go use soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: throw it out in like my yard and I'd have
just big pile of used soil that I wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: just reusing again, you know, and I just
go get another bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I recently, since watching you guys,
decided that I can, or I learned that I
[SPEAKER_01]: can reuse the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've been wasting a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm going to go over there and get
all that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I went and ran and got a 26 gallon
bin that I put my soil in and now I am
[SPEAKER_01]: mixing them with a Gaia green dry
amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I build that with some worm casting and
some micro riser.
[SPEAKER_01]: I throw that into the soil and I've just
been letting that sit there and cook.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a couple of months now and
everything's going great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, before that I was a synthetic nutrient
person though.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would just, yeah, like I said,
I would just throw out my soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: but now I'm reusing the soil and I'm
starting to go organics and I really dig
[SPEAKER_01]: in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot easier too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to feed so much as a
synthetic one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got Gaia green as kind of your base
nutrition and then just some worm castings
[SPEAKER_00]: and micro riser fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you been reusing your soil for
several grows now or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been, it's been about,
I would say about six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, almost the year I've been doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time flies when you're having fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I've just been reusing that soil
and just mixing the amendments in and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing that for as of late.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's working with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how do you do the feeding
throughout?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause eventually when you do that initial
amending, the nutrients are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: deplete unless you're loading it up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to do any feedings,
but I imagine since you're growing larger
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, you're vegging for a little bit
longer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably doing top dressings
throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you typically do your top
dressings?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, do you know what ratios you do
of like Gaia green and stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how much you tablespoon per gallon
or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do a little bit more than a
tablespoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do about three tablespoons per gallon is
what I try to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am, uh, I try to load it up as much as
possible because I'm getting a little lazy
[SPEAKER_01]: and I don't want to be in there every day
and mixing soils and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll put about three tablespoons per
gallon, um, put it on the top soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: mix it in, and then just water and be
doing that every couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And recently also, when I start to see
problems, if I start to see a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of deficiencies or something, I'll make a
brew and I started doing the brews.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not know like going into that,
that you wanted to see the bubbles.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you make a brew for those who don't
know, if you're putting in, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: your, uh, organic nutrients into your
water or a cheese cloth or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that you've put to keep it a little
bit, keep the water a little bit cleaner
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's something that I didn't
know that would happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the first time I just threw everything
in a bucket and I turned on the air stone
[SPEAKER_01]: and I said, left it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, okay, but I didn't even
cover it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I cover them and I started getting
that life, the bubbles and everything that
[SPEAKER_01]: you see on the top, um, that you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I really liked those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really dig it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you brew your tea?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just warm castings or is there some
Gaia green in there as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how long do you usually like brew for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put the Gaia green, uh, four four four.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the all purpose or is that,
I think it's, yeah, that's the all
[SPEAKER_01]: purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put the flowering in it and,
uh, the worm cast and I'll put in with a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of bone meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and some kelp too that I do have from
another company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some of that a friend gave it to me
and so I started adding that into the
[SPEAKER_01]: brew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I wanted to try molasses, but I'm not
too sure about how much molasses,
[SPEAKER_01]: what kind of molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I heard that you're not supposed to
use sweetened classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm not too sure about that one,
but on the sulfur is the one you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: target.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no preservatives in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of people do black strap
molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause a little bit easier to mix in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you mix it into kind of warmer water,
that'll actually mix into the water better
[SPEAKER_00]: than if it was, it was cooler water,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unsulfured black strap is pretty much the
most common.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do that and I stick it into my bucket
with some water and an air stone and I
[SPEAKER_01]: brew it for about three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some people say the longer the brew,
the longer, the better it is, but I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't really experimented too much on
how much is a lot like too long of a brew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I feel like three days is pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I know long brews can, things can go
anaerobic, bad pathogens that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can definitely mess up a tee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it before fed my plants and they
were not happy at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how long was the, how, how long is too
long?
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually just do 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've heard of some people who have 48
hours at the max.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard anybody go in three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a new one, new one for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could probably, I'm no master when it
comes to, uh, when it comes to brewing
[SPEAKER_00]: compost teas, but I've done, done them
several dozen times in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do them as much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually just to water and compost for
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I usually do it when I need to
either, um, I'm going organic and need to
[SPEAKER_00]: resolve a deficiency or if I'm just
looking to boost up the microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: population in order to have some more
decomposition in the, in the medium,
[SPEAKER_00]: faster decomposition, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to cut back on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try two days and we'll see how that
goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day I, one day it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I just forget about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'll set it and I'll walk out
and I'll just come back a couple of days
[SPEAKER_01]: later and be like, Oh no, the plants,
Oh no, the brew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got to do what I got to do and
get it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, uh, lives are busy, busy, busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you dilute the tea now when you create
the tea, you brew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now are you diluting it in water at any
ratio or anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just feeding that solution
directly to the plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just feed that solution directly to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, uh, yeah, I know I haven't diluted it
or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't thought of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants so far, they're loving it so
far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had any problems besides pest is
the only thing that I've been doing with
[SPEAKER_01]: the micro room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the teas are working out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to flip it back to the
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you said you've been doing organics
for about six months now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that you were doing synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of want to dive a little bit
into synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of people that listen to the
use synthetics, particularly when growing
[SPEAKER_00]: large plants, they want that precision
feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want everything to be soluble in
order to try to help get faster growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were you using for synthetic
nutrients and how are you going about your
[SPEAKER_00]: feedings?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, for the synthetic nutrients,
when I first started, I was using,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, general hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I had made the switch over to
Dutch pro nutrients from you guys were
[SPEAKER_01]: bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was back in the day when we were,
you guys were collaborating with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really liked those nutrients because
the general hydroponic was already pHed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So soon as you added it to the water,
your water would be at 6.2 and so 6.2,
[SPEAKER_01]: 6.5, whatever, whatever you pH it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it was easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just mix it, feed it to your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I did that for a while,
but then I started getting deficiencies
[SPEAKER_01]: and deficiencies started plaguing me all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I made the switch to organics,
which I feel is working better for me at
[SPEAKER_01]: the time right now, but I will every once
in a while still throw some synthetic in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, if I need to, if I'm just like,
Hey, this plant needs nitrogen right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, boom, just throw some nitrogen,
some, uh, veg, general hydroponic feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the synthetic approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people swear by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, and I've done it several times in
the past, you know, start out with the,
[SPEAKER_00]: organic medium to begin as organic
nutrients in there, then adding in some
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetics along with top dressing of
organic amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, getting through goes like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some of my best grows where I
combine the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really don't feel that you have to
go one or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the girl, it's your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you feel like you want to add some
synthetics in there, go for it,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, it's your thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no set science to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's ever said, Hey man, you've got to
do it this way or else, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: well there are people who will say that,
but you know, they, there's some people
[SPEAKER_01]: who will try to make you do what they
want, you know, or grow how they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel that you need to experience
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to, uh, experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to see, find out what works for
you the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, there's nothing worse than a
backseat grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody that comes in and tells you how
to grow your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, this, this, this, and now change
this and then do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, dude, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, I want to do a little bit
different, you know, I have my own style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me, let me do what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll ask you for help if I want
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one guy, uh, yeah, exactly how
you said that I'll ask you for help if I
[SPEAKER_01]: want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one guy out there in Instagram
who was, uh, he sent me a message and was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, dude, you need to do this,
this, this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, all right, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah, I already did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just took total offense to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, I've been growing 40
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to, you need to like,
or he sent me a video too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like shaking his pants.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, bro, that's not what I said.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just said that I did that already.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I could totally understand too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people, I could see how some
people are so passionate about the way
[SPEAKER_01]: that they grow, you know, and that they,
some people deep down, they're just trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't like being told that
they're not doing right, which I think
[SPEAKER_01]: they're getting defensive, you know,
they have that inner insecurities or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just feel like to lash out is
easier thing than to sit there and talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody and actually be like,
okay, man, my bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was tripping because I have
insecurities, you know, that's just so
[SPEAKER_01]: hard for some people to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can totally, I totally get what
you mean by that for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to bring it back to container size
and type for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you mentioned you start on one
gallons, then you go to three,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you go to five.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've tried to go to seven gallons
before, but you felt like that was a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that when you were growing with
organics or synthetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also are those plastic pots or
fabric pots or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was when I was doing all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I still do synthetic and organic
in that same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried some plastic one gallon pots,
but I just feel like they're not getting
[SPEAKER_01]: the air into the root system the way that
fabric pots do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really, like I understand that some
people like the way that the root system
[SPEAKER_01]: bounces around and starts to curl around
with the plastic, but I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the root system to be able to,
cause I feel that that leaves room for a
[SPEAKER_01]: root rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the roots are bouncing around,
they're getting tangled up too much,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I only use fabric pots ever
since I've been started growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just did fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the way that they, um, like they
could soak up water from the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like say, say you got fungus gnats and you
want to start watering on the bottom,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's easier for the fabric pots
for them to soak up the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and also I like that the root system,
supposedly when the root system goes out
[SPEAKER_01]: and it hits the fabric, it doesn't bounce
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just stops right there and it starts to
get bigger and bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, the root system is very
healthy in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's healthier with the fabric
pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did the one gallon to three gallon
to five gallon to seven gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my other friends, he does,
like I don't even know, I think like a 20
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon or something pot and his plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, bro, you are a savage.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I did that, my plants would be the size
of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different strokes for different folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many different ways to go
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people use plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people use fabric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people hate plastic, love fabric and
vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So me, I do like the plastic pots to
begin, but I did switch over to the
[SPEAKER_00]: grassroots fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So living soil fabric pots with the liner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, uh, one thing I learned from
Tyler over at grassroots, big shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: him is he had mentioned that, you know,
it's really not natural for when you go in
[SPEAKER_00]: with the living soil or organics having
the medium dry off from all sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they created one with a liner in the
middle of the pot, basically like from,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like two inches up and
upward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a little bit of aeration on the
bottom more than you'd get in a plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: pot, but it, it prevents all the sides
from drying out to dries off on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, those are the ones that I've been,
I've been really digging, but different
[SPEAKER_00]: strokes for different folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people certainly get away with just
doing, uh, organics with fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, uh, just recently started washing
my pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I went and bought new pots every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I first started growing,
I was wasting a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I didn't reuse my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't rewash my pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, I just went and got new
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after a while, it's just, it's just,
it's just, it's just, it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it started adding up that money adds up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, recently just started washing the
pots and I feel like it works as long as
[SPEAKER_01]: you run them through two times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything comes out nice and clean and
you can just reuse.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reuse where you can and save money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you transplant, are you doing
anything special?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some people have to do is a sprinkle
mycorrhizal fungi on the roots during
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like to put a scoop of warm
castings in the bottom of the hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally feel like that helps with
growth, prevents the transplant shock
[SPEAKER_00]: quote transplant shock that that you can
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if you disturb the roots too
much, it kind of just looks like the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: slowing down a little bit before it
bounces back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically when I'm sprinkling mycorrhizal
fungi and then adding in the scoop of a
[SPEAKER_00]: worm castings to the bottom of the hole,
growth just seems to continue on without
[SPEAKER_00]: any sort of stunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do anything during transplant like
that or, or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do actually, I do exactly what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, uh, transplant and I put the
mycorrhizal on the root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And put a little bit of worm cast in on
the bottom too, because I feel like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just, that makes sense, um, to put that
right there while you're transplanting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have it all open.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might as well get it to the,
to the root system while it's open.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also, when I do, I do break the bottom
of the, uh, the root system up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I break that open just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be careful though.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're transplanting, you want to
make sure that your soil is very dry
[SPEAKER_01]: because if it's not as dry for me,
at least, um, when I go to transfer the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil will fall apart off of the roots if
it's wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the drier it is, the more you pull it
out and it'll stay in one spot and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you can drop it into the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a little bit of wet, it'll fall
apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I have trouble with my
transplants and then you'll get the shock
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything like that to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it's really dry, I don't see any
shock and yeah, just put a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal and some worm castings on
there.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the meat and potatoes of
this whole talk, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the rest of the things that we're
going to be talking about really
[SPEAKER_00]: contributes to larger plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, how long do you veg the
plants for?
[SPEAKER_01]: So my veg, I veg for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will read the plant as I like to say,
which is making sure that's big enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say it's about seven weeks is
how long I veg for, maybe even eight some,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but in that veg time I'm topping and
I'm, uh, training like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said earlier, I sit there and
it's like the pregame, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the plant ready for the Superbowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the long veg is something that I really
stand by because I want my plants to be
[SPEAKER_01]: very healthy, very ready to go into this
flower stage and produce the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers that I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a seven week veg on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you flip out a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I asked you or if you
mentioned how many plants, is that for
[SPEAKER_00]: like one plant and a full by four or how
many plants are you putting in that four
[SPEAKER_00]: by four that you mentioned you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, um, what I would do is I, I usually
stick it to about three plants in a four
[SPEAKER_01]: by four that I, uh, because I find that
four is just too big.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that I grow, my plants grow so big
that they bush out really big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I'm starting to, cause I,
uh, do the technique from pitches 420
[SPEAKER_01]: where I break the membrane on the stem,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll break the membrane and I'll set
the plant down or super cropping,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what it's called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll just be super cropping on top of
topping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really trained this plant to go out
because it gets very bushy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the time that I put it into the four
by four tent, I can only fit three plants
[SPEAKER_01]: in before they start to, because it looks
like, uh, you know, you got a lot of room,
[SPEAKER_01]: but once they start to flower,
wow, these plants start to fill the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: tent out and then there's no room for you
to get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I always have to have room for
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be able to get in, to get into the
bottom of it, to clean up the bottom,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, stems or, you know, do all the
maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three plants and you're trying to fill
it wall to wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how tall are they typically before
flipping?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got, you know, from the ground
up about a foot for the grill pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: How tall is it before you kind of
flipping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you've got space constraints too,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're doing your training,
you're doing the topping, low stress
[SPEAKER_00]: training, super cropping, and then you're,
you're shaping it the way you want it to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to max out that grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how tall is it really before
flipping to flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say about two feet over the one foot
pod.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be about three feet altogether.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then you got to in count,
you got to take in count that there is
[SPEAKER_01]: that stretch going to happen to a flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you gotta be ready for that
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing that I have to deal with
a lot is growing big plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be ready for the stretch to
happen and you have to be ready for how
[SPEAKER_01]: much room you're going to have from the
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant because you don't want the
plant touching the light, but when growing
[SPEAKER_01]: big plants, it's going to happen
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had so many plants outgrow and come
up into light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I went on vacation one time came
back and the plants were grown into the
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily I was able to just prune off some
branches and I was good to go,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it certainly can be a problem where it
kind of overgrows the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing when to flip, making sure
you're not over-vegging your plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: where all of a sudden you're running into
height constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to prune when you don't want
to prune and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing exactly when to flip and how
long to veg your plants are super,
[SPEAKER_00]: super key.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing that I've ran into also is
because I have a perpetual growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a bunch of, you know,
stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my veg tan, I got my flower tan,
I got my clone tan, I got my drying tan,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if these tents aren't perfectly
sink, then sometimes you're going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: to veg for longer and the veg tent than
you would want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that happens a lot more often than
I would like it to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in turn, what happens is when I
move it to the flower tan, we have the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant touching the lights and you're going
to have to prune it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that I've noticed that
freaked me out the first time I saw it was
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaf touching the, I think it's the
red diode that gives you the red spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll burn, it'll burn the plant and it's
burnt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you want to be careful for that
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be out there, keep an eye on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make sure that if a leaf is hitting
the light, it will burn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prune it down if you have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will stunt the plant a little bit,
but I feel like it'll be okay in the long
[SPEAKER_00]: run.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about pruning techniques like
lollipopping or defoliation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing those things at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the lollipop and do default.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm in there defaulting all like
crazy because the rule that I feel like is
[SPEAKER_01]: you want all the energy to go up to these
colas, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't want to waste too much energy
down here with these popcorn buds that are
[SPEAKER_01]: just going to be, if you're hand trimming,
they're just hard to trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody likes to waste time on the popcorn
buds when you're hand trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in return, lollipop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go in there and I defoliate and I
lollipop like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will just leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just be looking for colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: My goal is to get the big colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want these fat and just beautiful
looking ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I lollipop and I train like
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you do that in veg before flipping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in particular, maybe break down one
by one for lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you only doing it in veg before
flipping the flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you also lollipopping in flower at
some point or throw a flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it in flower also.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get the plant look in the way that I
really like, which is lollipop and topped
[SPEAKER_01]: and super cropped, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So throughout those seven weeks,
she's going to be looking very nice before
[SPEAKER_01]: I put her in the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when I put her in the flower,
there's going to be these bud sites that
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to show up on the bottom that a
lot of growers know what I'm talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have that one little nug just
sticking out on the bottom stand that's
[SPEAKER_01]: just really developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks nice, but it's taking that
energy away from the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, you just go down there and
just be picking off whatever's on the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to make it about a foot from the
pot, nothing from under there,
[SPEAKER_01]: just completely stripped and all the stems
are up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: In turn, what happens in that time though,
is you will get floppage.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a coin, a term that I want to
coin, but it's the floppage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real big problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is your, you know, your buds get
too big and they just start flopping over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they start flopping over,
that's when you need the trellis or what I
[SPEAKER_01]: use is the yo-yo hangers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just hang up on the top of your tent
and just come down and you just hook it
[SPEAKER_01]: onto your bud and it'll hold it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another product that I've used is the
umbrella trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, have you heard of this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the owner on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the umbrella trellis, man,
that's one product that I'm standing by.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you learn how to use it, I didn't know
how to use it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I asked the owner, the maker,
and he showed me what he does in his grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Oh, now that's how it's
supposed to look.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put two trellises on there,
then you have the ability to take out the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant out of the spot, wherever that you
have, and you still have be able to hold
[SPEAKER_01]: the nugs up and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the umbrella trellis is really cool
invention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people don't like it, but I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask you about support for
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had mentioned trellis net and the
yo-yos and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next question is if you just using a
regular trellis net, are you doing just
[SPEAKER_00]: one layer or are you doing multiple
layers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have only done trellising maybe
three times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was one time I did one there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one time I did the two layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but like I said, I need to may have
room for me to get into the grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are into the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't fit in under a trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get under there and have to water because
I'm still hand watering too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, even though I do have a blue mat
system that I need to hook up and get
[SPEAKER_01]: going, uh, which I had a question for you
on that, but we'll ask that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, trellises have never been my
deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I've never really liked trellises.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't get over the fact that I
can't get in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when the plant is done that you
have to be able to get that trellis off of
[SPEAKER_01]: the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back in the day when I was doing more
synthetic nutrients, I would have to flush
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot more often than not.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, a lot of times having a
flush inside of a tent and move that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: out is just, uh, while it's strapped down
to a trellis, it's just crazy,
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, I really like trellises too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a lot of people listening in
here that are home growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're newer and they want to grow
large plants indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice do you have for those folks
that are kind of just getting started
[SPEAKER_00]: growing large plants indoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the advice that I would give them
would be to do a lot, a longer veg,
[SPEAKER_01]: a longer veg time will give you a bigger
plant and flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, you just gotta be, be patient
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta be patient with it because I
know you want to get it into the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to, you know, get it flowering
and get all the, the good excitement out
[SPEAKER_01]: of it, but it's better to have the,
I like to put it in child kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want your child nice and healthy,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you go set them into football or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the way I put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The veg is the most important thing to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the veg is nice and good and
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you shouldn't, you should just be
able to flow right through flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we all know that that's not what
really happens sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes a flower, you know, problems
arise and you're just going to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have a real long veg,
you'll have a real big plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of problems, what problems have
you run into and how did you resolve them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we talking on problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean like this or just anything that's
going to prevent you from growing large
[SPEAKER_00]: plants or hinders from large plant
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're trying to, you know,
your end goal there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problems that I have, one thing in
growing big plants is you're going to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to lose a lot of room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, these plants take up a lot of room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take up a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take up a lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to start to be getting a lot
of deficiencies because the bigger the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, the more they're going to want
energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need more, more, uh, nutrients to
create this energy, to keep them healthy,
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep them thick and, um, you know,
wanting to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, they're going to be having more
deficiencies is one thing that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: noticed that happens to me a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, also the floppage when you're growing
big plants, you're going to have that
[SPEAKER_01]: floppage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be ready to put a trellis on there or
yo-yo hangers or something to hold up
[SPEAKER_01]: those big buds because those buds are
going to get really big and they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to start hanging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing it's guys just room because
you're not going to be able to put,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you could put nine plants in there
and try to grow nine big plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're just going to be having too
many things grabbed together, not enough
[SPEAKER_01]: air circulation because there's going to
just be too much foliation in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I keep it to about three
plants at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people might want to do more,
more power to you, but yeah, big plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be ready for a floppage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Floppage is something that happens to be a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people might want to do less than
three plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people, some people like to do just
one plant right in the middle of their
[SPEAKER_00]: four by four and veg it for that long
period and put it into a trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, is there a specific reason
why you do three plants instead of like
[SPEAKER_01]: one plant just, Oh no, I've done one plant
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done one plant in a seven gallon pot
and that was a massive plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took up like, it might've been three
plants in one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, I've done that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people, if you follow me on Instagram,
you've seen that plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant was huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like it beat me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was almost like little shop of horrors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like feed me Seymour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was a little intimidated by this
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they get really big man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that I've noticed that if
anybody has grown outdoors, they know that
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors, they can get huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I did that one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to experiment and I was like,
well, I grow really big plants indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see what happens if I put it
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I took one of my strains that I
cloned out and that had been doing indoors
[SPEAKER_01]: and I put it outdoors and Jesus Lord,
it was huge brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two plants I had out there and they just
took up a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to do a floppage, which is one
thing that I'm always dealing with,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they came out good and I just wanted
to see how big it would get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was in a 30 gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that was pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice experience right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I very, I highly recommend everybody
to experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Experiment with everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how big you can get your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if it's, if it's something that you're
into, if you're something that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: handle, if you can't handle it,
keep them smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's some really good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, is there anything else we need to
cover?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think here when it relates
to growing large plants indoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: we covered lighting, environment,
we got soil, nutrition, training.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did almost everything here,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else you can think of that we
should talk about for large plants growing
[SPEAKER_00]: them indoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say patience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patience is one thing that is a key in
growing in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to have patience for
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to have the best product or
the best, you know, the best product that
[SPEAKER_01]: you could produce because you're putting
in all your time in this and you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to put all your time in for nothing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have also one thing I wanted
to point out is I want to have everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not, not to stress too much about it
because I, I, I try to nurture a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: new growers and I tell them like,
don't stress about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supposed to be having fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have fun on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, don't take it too seriously because as
long as you gain that knowledge,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could always do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: If something goes wrong, your plant dies
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can always plant another seed and you
can give it another shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just keep up with it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the advice I have for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep with it and don't give up and have
fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
