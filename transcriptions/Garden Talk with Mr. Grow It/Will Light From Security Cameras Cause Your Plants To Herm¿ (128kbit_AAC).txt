[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back with another video.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video I want to talk about
security cameras in your grow space,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically the light that security
cameras emit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a grower reach out to me recently
and he had mentioned that he has security
[SPEAKER_00]: cameras in his grow tent and he swears
that his plants went hermy because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: security camera, the light that it emits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally did not come across this and
I don't really have the knowledge to know
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not this type of light from
security cameras will impact plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I'd reach out to a lighting
expert and get their opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hit up Dan from the Green Sunshine
company and got him on to a zoom call and
[SPEAKER_00]: here's what he had to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, Dan, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining me tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Chris, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good, pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a good lighting question for you,
something that might actually stump you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love lighting questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've had somebody reach out to me quite
recently and his plants turned out to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodite plant and what his theory
is, is he recently found out that his
[SPEAKER_00]: security cameras that he has in his grow
emit light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people don't know that,
in security cameras they emit light,
[SPEAKER_00]: IR light, infrared light is what they
emit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is confident that that turned his
plants to be a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to reach out to you because,
you in particular, because you own the
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Sunshine company, you have a couple
different grow lights and one thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're real known for and it's on your
website is the Emerson effect and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerson effect for those that don't know
is basically it's a combination of IR
[SPEAKER_00]: light as well as other lights on the
spectrum results in faster growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But IR alone, I'm not sure if that would
actually trigger the plant to do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to kind of reach out to you
today and get your thoughts on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a really great question
because it's going to help you understand
[SPEAKER_01]: how plants respond to light and what I
think is important to understand is the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant has several systems inside of it
that may get triggered by light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might think, hey, we're giving the
plant light and like it is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: respond.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant actually has several systems
inside of it that will respond to light,
[SPEAKER_01]: like whether it knows it's going to sleep,
using it as energy to grow, it will
[SPEAKER_01]: respond to it like a signal and also use
it as energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a few different things that are
going on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So photosynthesis, pretty much if you have
a broad range of light from UV to
[SPEAKER_01]: infrared, if it's joined with other
colors, it will create growth on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only the colors in the par range will
create growth if it's a single color.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I was looking at a security camera,
if it would affect growth or not,
[SPEAKER_01]: it probably would not just in terms of an
intensity standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it may not be significant for any sort
of growth because it's not significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that touches on your
viewers question was the hermaphroditing
[SPEAKER_01]: and there we're getting into the day night
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that's the phytochrome system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is sensitive to mostly blue light
and red light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's exactly why you can go into your
grow room with the green light and your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants don't wake up because that green
light is not picked up by that system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that system doesn't even see it and it
doesn't even know there's any light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may use that green light for
photosynthesis, but it may not wake up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So green light's interesting like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same goes for infrared light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does not wake up the phytochrome
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and it's actually used, infrared light
is used to put plants to sleep faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you, you can, you can buy like
infrared pucks and turn them on right
[SPEAKER_01]: after your lights turn off and it'll
actually help your plants go to sleep
[SPEAKER_01]: faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't get into the specifics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So infrared at night, is actually a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you ever have like a light flash
in your room, you want to dose your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll make them go to sleep even
faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took a, you asked me this question
ahead of time and I, you gave me a heads
[SPEAKER_01]: up and I actually went back here into our
office and I took a spectro, I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: little Apogee instruments and I took a
reading here and you can see it's in the
[SPEAKER_01]: like 780 range in grow lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally what's effective for growth is
like you know, 700, 720, 740 and then
[SPEAKER_01]: right after that it really drops off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this wouldn't really affect growth so
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, I am actually not sure if this would
affect the phytochrome system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if this alone was in your grow room,
it wouldn't be a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if your light had like actually when
you were viewing it, it had any visible
[SPEAKER_01]: light, that would be bad, especially if it
was blue light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause generally blue LEDs are very intense
and that is the, that is the signal that
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant actually looks for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's the truest signal your plant
looks for for the presence of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So blue light is very bad for any sort of
day night thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in short, if you look at your security
camera and you can't visibly see any
[SPEAKER_01]: light, you're probably okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you see light, definitely cover it
up and then know that your infrared sensor
[SPEAKER_01]: might be somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two, two sources of light,
like the indicator of the saying it's on
[SPEAKER_01]: or the infrared sensor that lets you have
night vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully that answers the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I miss anything, Chris?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have, do you have any questions
that I might've missed?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I do have a follow up question
that brings up a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said any other light on top of
that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a status light on the actual
piece of equipment and that's one thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've run into before is I actually
had a status light from my humidifier and
[SPEAKER_00]: from my heater, I have to cover them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those, just to confirm those will
actually cause your plants to hermy out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those were to go towards, you know,
during the dark period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically always cover, cover those up
because like, even if it doesn't like why
[SPEAKER_01]: take the chance?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, cover those status indicators up,
especially if it's blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this information has helped out
some of you who are wondering about this
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'd love to know in the comment
section for those of you who have security
[SPEAKER_00]: cameras in your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever had plants hermprimum or you
think have hermed from it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comment section
below.

MRGROWIT and you can get a percentage off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time this video is released,
they have just released their V3 version
